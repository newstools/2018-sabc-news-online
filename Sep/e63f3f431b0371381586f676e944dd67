Kimberley Hospital in the Northern Cape has been renamed after struggle icon, Robert Mangaliso Sobukwe, the founder of the Pan Africanist Congress. Sobukwe’s family attended the renaming ceremony, which formed part of Heritage Day commemorations. Sobukwe died in the hospital in 1978. His grandson, Mangaliso Sobukwe says his family is grateful because this move by the government will help preserve Sobukwe’s legacy. “As a family, we are very happy. We do feel that’s an honour that he really truly does deserve, seeing that he spent a part of his life here in Kimberley, and also this hospital being the place where he passed on. So, we appreciate the significance of it. We appreciate the significance that it’s being done on this day,” says Sobukwe’s grandson. Click link for more
