The family of Environmental Affairs Minister Edna Molewa says she succumbed to complications of Legionnaires’ disease, a severe form of pneumonia.  Inhaling the legionella bacteria causes the lung inflammation. Molewa’s brother, Fana Mmethi, says the family appreciates the support it has been receiving from members of the public since her passing yesterday. Molewa died in a Pretoria hospital where she had been admitted for two weeks. She was 61. The government will accord Molewa an official funeral. President Cyril Ramaphosa announced this after visiting the late Molewa’s family home in Pretoria on Saturday night. Watch related video below
