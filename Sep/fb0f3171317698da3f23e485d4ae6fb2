ANC Secretary-General Ace Magashule has appealed to all those who can afford to pay for municipal services to do so to ensure the survival of the Sedibeng Municipality in the Vaal. The municipality can’t afford to render basic services to the communities. Refuse has continued to pile-up and sewage to run through the streets of townships in the municipality. Magashule visited the area on Monday for the commemoration of the 34th anniversary of the Vaal uprisings. Students’ organisation Cosas had organised the uprisings against the proposed increase in tariffs for municipal rates. Magashule says the survival of the municipality is important. He says: “We are making an appeal to those who can still pay to do so, so that the rich must subsidies the poor. We as ANC members are saying we should not look at government to deliver some of the services. Those who are fortunate like us must contribute.” Meanwhile, one of the organisers of the Vaal uprisings Jerry Thlopane says for the municipality to survive there should be a collective effort from all communities. “I hope the youth of today should be like us, that is we should be community orientated. We should be looking at what is happening around us and assist our parents to make this country a better country,” says Thlopane. Related video
