Gauteng Economic Development MEC, Lebogang Maile, has launched operation Okae Molao in Germiston, Ekurhuleni. The operation is targeting local spaza shops across the province, with the intention of clamping down on illegal spaza shops and the selling of fake goods and expired food. The launch of this program comes over a week after locals allegedly looted foreign owned spaza shops accusing them of selling expired foods. “These  products will no longer have space or market in our townships. We are putting a stop from now, working closely with the relevant enforcement agencies and entities tasked with responsibility to enforce and monitor. We will be kick starting our Okae molao to deal with the selling of illegal and fake goods products in spaza shops across the province,” said Maile. Watch  related video below:
