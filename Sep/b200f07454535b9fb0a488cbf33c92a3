Trade union Nehawu and the Public Servants Association say they will leave no stone unturned in ensuring that there’s accountability for the deadly fire. Nehawu spokesperson Gracia Rikhotso says the incident resulted from the negligence of some government departments. Rikhotso says Nehawu is not sympathetic to any of the people who are responsible for the fire. She says: “In our own opinion, there are three parties to this particular issue. Firstly it’s the department of health, secondly it is the department of infrastructure development and lastly it is the department of labour.” “To us, this is a case of pure negligence. We do not believe that this is an accident. This incident could have been prevented had the department listened to us as organised labour.” Related Video
