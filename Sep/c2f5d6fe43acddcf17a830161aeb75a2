The embattled Sol Plaatje Mayor Mangaliso Matika has resigned. The African National Congress in the Northern Cape confirmed Matika’s resignation at a media briefing in Kimberley. The community embarked on a protest to demanded Matika’s resignation after a proposed electricity tariff hike of R260. Provincial ANC secretary Deshi Ngxangxa explains:”We have been in constant engagement with comrade Matika, the leadership of the REC, branches of the ANC, after much deliberations and considerations; the PEC welcomes the resignation of comrade Matika as the mayor of Sol Plaatje.” Meanwhile three ANC regions in the North West, have announced that they have officially made written submissions to Luthuli House, to immediately rescind what they call the factional decision to disband the North West Provincial Executive Committee. They argue that, the move is unconstitutional, and set to only serve the interests of those that wanted to settle political scores against former party chairperson and premier Supra Mahumapelo. They held a joint media conference in Christiana, at the Lekwa-Teemane municipality earlier on Monday. Ruth Mompati regional secretary Gaolatlhwe Kgano spoke on behalf of the three regions. “This was a pre-determined decision. We call the NEC to respect the constitution by allowing the current PEC to complete the remaining six months term in office and to ensure that the change of leadership in the province remains the democratic right of the branches.” Click video below:
