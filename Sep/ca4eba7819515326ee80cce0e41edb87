Lesotho’s Attorney-General has filed court papers accusing suspended Chief Justice Nthomeng Majara of inciting violence and threatening peace and stability in the Mountain Kingdom. This comes after Majara’s lawyer wrote a letter saying she would ignore her suspension and resume her duties. She was suspended by the King following the advice of Prime Minister Tom Thabane last week. Organisations including Amnesty International, have warned that the government is infringing on the independence of the judiciary. According to the Lesotho Internal Security Act a person suspected of Subversion can be arrested by any police officer, held for up to 14 days, or until the Commissioner releases them, and the Criminal Procedure Act can be waived in their arrest. This law can now be applied to the Suspended Chief Justice and her Lawyer who are now effectively being called “enemies of the state” for challenging the Prime Minister. The Attorney General also wants Majara barred from going anywhere near her office, and her lawyer Qhalehang Letsika is investigated by the Law Society for misconduct
