The tiny African kingdom of eSwatini, ruled by an absolute monarch, voted Friday in polls that critics call a sham but supporters say are a unique blend of tradition and politics. Political parties are banned from the election, and voters chose from individual candidates who are almost all loyal to King Mswati III. The king is one of the world’s last absolute rulers — wielding complete control over the parliament and government, as well as over the judiciary, civil service and security forces. Mswati, who has 14 wives and more than 25 children, has a reputation for lavish spending on planes and palaces, while 63 percent of his subjects live below the poverty line. Without warning or consultation, he changed the country’s name from Swaziland to eSwatini (“land of the Swazis”) in April. “We know the person we are voting for,” Zodwa Mabuza told AFP as she lined up to vote with her husband and daughter in the western constituency of Lobamba Lomdzala. “The issues are job opportunities, proper roads and more food packages for the elderly.” Another voter who declined to be named said that “the parliament can talk all they want, but at the end of the day there is only one boss”. The authorities say that the absence of political parties fosters a close link between citizens and elected representatives. “To the critics, it is important to say that there is no ‘one size fits all’ democracy or system of government,” Pholile Dlamini, deputy chair of the Elections and Boundaries Commission, told AFP. “This system is a perfect fit because eSwatini is a modern-day country that has chosen to preserve its very rich cultures and traditions.” Winners from the 59 constituency ballots will take seats in parliament, along with 10 lawmakers that the king appoints directly. He can veto legislation, appoint the prime minister and cabinet, and is constitutionally above the law. WATCH RELATED VIDEO BELOW:
