The Democratic Alliance (DA) in Gauteng has called for the sacking of Provincial Health MEC, Gwen Ramokgopa over the crisis at the Thelle Mogoerane Hospital in Vosloorus, east of Johannesburg. The hospital management on Saturday confirmed that a psychiatric patient had died at the hospital on 14 September. This follows the deaths of six babies who contracted Klebsiella pneumonia in the hospital’s neo-natal unit since July this year. Overcrowding and a shortage of staff have been blamed for the outbreak. “Now we hear that the third psychiatric patient has died in less than a year. I really think that top management should be thoroughly replaced and the MEC for Health, Gwen Ramokgopa shares the blame for these deaths as well as the deaths of six Klebsiella babies. She should have removed the former CEO of this hospital far sooner, she should have intervened far sooner and I think she should be fired or resign over this terrible situation at this hospital,” says DA Gauteng Shadow Health MEC, Jack Bloom.
