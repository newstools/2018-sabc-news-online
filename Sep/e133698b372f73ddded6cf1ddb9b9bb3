Students of the Tshwane University of Technology (TUT) will go back to class on Monday. This after  the institution obtained an urgent court interdict from the Pretoria High Court on Friday. TUT spokesperson, Willa de Ruiter, says the interdict follows the violent protests at TUT’s north and south campusses in Soshanguve, earlier this week. The interdict prevents the protesters from entering the campuses as well as preventing them from participating in any disruptive activities on the Soshanguve campuses. De Ruiter says tests for students at the Soshanguve campuses will commence on 17 September to allow them sufficient time to prepare. Tests that are due to start on Monday at the other campuses will go ahead as planned. Click below for related videos:
