Motorists have been advised that they are not obliged to pay car guards while parking their cars. This after a car guard allegedly stabbed a motorist in the Johannesburg CBD over a parking space. Police Spokesperson Xoli Mbele says the guard has been arrested and will appear in court on Monday. “The victim parked his car, and the car guard told him to remove his car from the parking. The driver refused, and the suspect just crossed the street to fetch the knife then he came back and stabbed the driver once in the upper body. Security guards came to his rescue and apprehended the suspect. We are appealing to the car guards that they must refrain from forcing motorists to pay for parking their vehicles. Motorists must give if they are willing to do so – not by force,” says Mbhele.
