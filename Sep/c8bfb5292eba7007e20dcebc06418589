Police have made several arrests in Bonteheuwel in Cape Town as the total shutdown continues. Police have also used water cannon, stun grenades, rubber bullets and teargas to disperse protesting crowds in townships. The city says the protests are illegal as no permission was sought by the organisers. One of those arrested is one of the leaders of the campaign, Henriette Abrahams. This comes after residents blockaded Jakes Gerwel and Bluegum Roads in Bonteheuwel. The protesters have taken to the streets across Cape Town to voice their anger against gangsterism and crime. A resident of Bontheuwel expresses his disappointment regarding the arrests. <a href="https://iono.fm/e/606747">Content hosted by iono.fm</a>  Watch below for more:
