A clear timeline has emerged for implementation of the National Health Insurance(NHI). The first phase started in 2012 and ended last year with pilot projects across the country. The next four years will see the legislation and policy created for this health system. The last phase will be between 2022 and 2026 when all South Africans will be covered under the NHI. Deputy Director General at the Health Department, Dr Anban Pillay explained this at the BD Healthcare Summit held in Sandton this week. He also clarified the issue of whether foreign nationals would be treated under the NHI. He says South African citizens will obviously have access to the full package of services. On the issue of foreign nationals he says: “Non South Africans, depending on which category they fall under, for example if they are a refugee or an asylum seeker, we have a legal obligation in terms of international law to provide them with emergency services as well as basic health services.” “However if they are not in those categories and they are effectively coming into South Africa wanting to access a service, then obviously they have to pay for that service depending on which provider they choose to go to.” Watch related Video:
