Tshwane University of Technology (TUT) management has rescinded an earlier decision to re-open suspended classes at the Soshanguve North campus on Monday. The classes were suspended at the two Soshanguve campuses following a series of violent protests and destruction of university properties two weeks ago. TUT spokesperson Willa de Ruyter says the university’s decision comes in the wake of renewed student protests on the Soshanguve North campus overnight. “We have been engaging with student leaders, listening to their demands. We have made resolutions; we gave feed back to them. We published those decisions on our website and we also provided and point to student leaders to share with the students. However, we think it doesn’t seem to come to rest. “On Sunday there was once again protest action, damage to property. After accessing the situation we decided that we are going to suspend the activities at north campus again for Monday. We will assess the situation during the cause of the day and there will be a number of engagements to determine what the way forward would be,” De Ruyter explained.
