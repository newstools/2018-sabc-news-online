Finance Minister Nhlanhla Nene says a number of trade-offs will be considered when moving funds as government reprioritises spending and cuts down on borrowing. His statement comes after President Cyril Ramaphosa unveiled his economic recovery plan on Friday. Its main feature is a more than R400-billion for infrastructure development to be financed by a private-public partnership. The aim of Ramaphosa’s plan is to boost economic growth and create jobs. Nene explains how the trade-offs will be done. “Trade-off has to do with when you have new priorities and there is urgency of delivering on the new priorities. Moving funds will be mainly from underperforming. A number of trade-offs are going to be taken into account.” Related video click below:
