Closing arguments are expected to be heard on Friday in the trial of former Parktown Boys High water polo coach Collen Rex‚ in the High Court in Johannesburg, sitting in the Palm Ridge Magistrate’s Court in Ekurhuleni. The 22-year-old is facing more than 200 charges relating to the sexual abuse of minors at the school from 2014 to 2016. In August, Rex pleaded guilty to 144 such charges. The abuse came to light after the accused was caught on a surveillance camera allegedly fondling a 15-year-old learner in the common room of the school’s hostel in November 2016. The state and the defence are expected to present their closing arguments. Earlier this week, Rex told the court that he was very young and immature at the time of the offences, as he was only 19 years old. He went on to say that when he looks back at the sequence of events that unfolded, he feels that he could have been more responsible and handled things better. Rex also adamantly denied showing any of the learners pornographic videos as well as touching them inappropriately. Judgement is expected to be handed down on Monday.
