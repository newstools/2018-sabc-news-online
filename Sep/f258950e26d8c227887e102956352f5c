The Pan African Congress(PAC) has vowed to continue to strive for a united revolutionary movement after the 2019 general elections. On Saturday, leaders of what has been termed the United PAC held a meeting in Vereeniging in the Vaal to outline plans for a party elective conference in December. One of the leaders, Letlapa Mphahlele told the media that following the recent PAC unity conference in Kimberley to deal with divisions, they are more than united. He says their main focus now is to regain the public’s confidence. He says: “It is very pleasing that everybody is talking PAC language today and the issues that we are addressing. For instance, the issue of safety in schools and the issue of land, everybody is resonating with it.” “So it is not about the numbers of the members, it is about the policy’s appeal to the public. So we are very confident that going to national elections next year with a democratically elected PAC leadership, we are going to do better than we did last time,” says Mphahlele. Related Video
