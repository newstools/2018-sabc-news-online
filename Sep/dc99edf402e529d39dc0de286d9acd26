Limpopo MEC for Transport Makoma Makhurupetje says the Zambian government made it easy for the South African government to assist in the repatriation process of the bodies of the 11 victims of last week’s bus crash. The Zambian nationals were killed on Monday when the bus they were travelling in veered off the road after apparently bursting a tyre. Makhurupetje was speaking during the official hand over of the bodies to the Zambian embassy at the Polokwane airport. She says they expect similar cooperation from Zimbabwe when repatriating the bodies of the nine people who were killed in Thursday’s bus crash, also in Limpopo. “Normally, it is very difficult to get other countries. Remember, these are private buses. We were lucky that the Zambian government were very handy. We hope in Zimbabwe, as well, the similar thing will happen and we hope we will have the similar and smooth running of the process in that way. We are waiting for finalisation of both reports in the next few days.” Click below for below for more on the story:
