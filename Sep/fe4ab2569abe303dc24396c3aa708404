All flags at the 1146 police stations in South Africa are flying at half-mast to honour the women and men of the police service who have lost their lives in the line of duty. Officials, police leadership, colleagues, families and friends gather on Sunday at the Police Memorial Site at the Union buildings in Pretoria to lay wreaths. Twenty-nine police members died on duty between April 2017 and March 2018, while Constable Siboniso Buthelezi was shot dead near the KwaMashu hostel, north of Durban, just nine days ago. The police’s Athlenda Mathe has called on all South Africans to observe a moment of silence today as National Police Safety Month kicks off. “Today (Sunday), we are saying thank you to these members for paying the ultimate price in ensuring that the people of South Africa are safe. We once again call on all South Africans to continue to support the mandate and work of the police in fighting crime. And also to ensure that we do away with criminality in South Africa and that we reduce attacks and killings of our members,” Mathe explains.
