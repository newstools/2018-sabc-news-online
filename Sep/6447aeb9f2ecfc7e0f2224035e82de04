National Assembly Speaker Baleka Mbete says a more conducive environment has to be created for South African doctors who received training from Cuba. Mbete led a multi-party delegation on a five-day visit to Cuba. The visit included meeting South African medical doctor students in Cuba. The delegation says it held insightful deliberations with the Cuban Health Ministry and the Head of National Academic Training Dr Jorge Gonzalez. One of the issues raised related to the two health care systems used by Cuba and South Africa. The Caribbean country used the family health care approach which is different from the South African approach of public hospital care. Mbete said there will be further engagements on the two approaches with Parliamentary committees expected to visit Cuba. “There is already an arrangement and discussion to prepare for the visit of two portfolio committees of our Parliament and that is the Portfolio Committee of Health and the Portfolio Committee of Sport. We hope that you will be as open and as ready to share your experiences and the information as possible, so that there should be waves of South Africans that come and listen so that we are also ready to receive the students that have been here and create a more conducive atmosphere for their approach, rather than an antagonistic approach to the two approaches.” Watch related video:
