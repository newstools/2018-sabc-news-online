Hundreds of commuters using Passenger rail agency Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa’s (Prasa) Metrorail have been left stranded and forced to seek alternative transport on Tuesday morning. Prasa halted all its train services in KwaZulu Natal indefinitely after commuters vandalised train station in uMlazi, where four coaches were reportedly torched on Friday. Metrorail Regional Spokesperson Zama Nomnganga says, “The train coach was set alight, property was vandalised, our staff are still in trauma because they were locked inside the office by the commuters who were throwing stones at them. It was a scary moment for them.” “The trains are still suspended until further notice. Hopefully by the end of the week we will have answers because we are meeting with the structures and government. We will also engage the community where we operate so we get assurances that our drivers, trains and commuters are safe,” adds Nomnganga.
