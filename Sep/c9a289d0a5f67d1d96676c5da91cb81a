The African National Congress (ANC) Member of Parliament Vincent Smith will know by Wednesday whether his request to step aside as chairperson of various committees has been granted or not. This is according to the ANC Chief Whip’s Office in Parliament. Smith requested to step aside until the Ethics Committee had concluded its investigation against him. He recently made headlines following allegations that he received close to R700 000 from Bosasa security company starting in 2015. Smith allegedly said the money was a personal loan from the company’s former chief operating officer Angelo Agrizzi. Smith is currently chairing the Justice and Correctional Services Committee, the Standing Committee on the Auditor-General and co-chairing the Joint Constitutional Review Committee. ANC Caucus spokesperson Nonceba Mhlauli says, “Following the allegations that came to light in the past weekend in the media, comrade Vincent has requested to step aside from all positions where he is a chairperson of a portfolio committee and the Chief Whip will take that request to the political committee which is schedule to sit on Wednesday. By Wednesday we will know as to what the outcome of that particular request is. If it is granted, who the acting chairperson will be, pending the finalisation of this particular matter.
