Employees from several Gauteng Government Departments will have to report at alternative offices from Tuesday morning. This follows Sunday’s decision by the provincial government to evacuate all nine buildings that have been found to be non-compliant to the minimum health and safety standards in the Johannesburg CBD. The Office of the Premier as well as Provincial Treasury is among the affected departments. Workers at the Department of Health and two other departments were the first to be affected when their building caught fire last week. Three fire-fighters died in the deadly blaze which engulfed the Bank of Lisbon building. Gauteng Government spokesperson Thabo Masebe says: “The Gauteng Provincial Government has decided that we need to act urgently to ensure that all the buildings comply with the OHS minimum standards.” “During the time when we attend to the compliance issues, we will ask staff to report to alternative offices so that we have space to deal with all the defects in the building.” Click video below:
