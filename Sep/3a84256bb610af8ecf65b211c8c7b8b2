The City of Cape Town says a total shutdown planned for Tuesday in various communities on the Cape Flats is an illegal protest. The communities are protesting against rising poverty, crime and unemployment levels. Mayoral Committee Member for Safety and Security, JP Smith says the city supports legal public protests, but it does not condone illegal marches. He says the South African Police Services will work with the City of Cape Town to deal with any disruptions. “The problem is that this protest has not applied for a permit in terms of the National Regulations of Gathering Act.  So this puts them in automatic conflict with SAPS. We will likely see a replay of the kind of footage or situation of conflict between the South African Police Service and the Shutdown marchers which is extremely unfortunate,” adds Smith.
