A domestic worker and two co-accused are expected to be sentenced in the Durban High Court on Friday in connection with the murder of 55-year-old retired teacher, Shakila Singh. The court heard arguments on appropriate sentences for the three accused from the state and defence on Thursday. Nonjabulo Mteki, Amon Ngongi and Ally Jumar Abdullah were all found guilty of robbery with aggravating circumstances. Mteki was cleared of murder charges. She had been a domestic worker for Singh for 14 years. The retired teacher was found dead on her bedroom floor with duct tape around her face. Her hands and legs were bound with cable ties. The family of Shakila Singh was present in court. Her brother-in-law, Ken Maharaj says they are hopeful that the suspects will be given a proper sentence. “We are very hopeful that the proper sentence will be given, that the law will take its course, and restitution will be given for the deceased. Submissions were made and it was fair and the judge did say that he would consider all the aspects. So, we as the family, are hoping, even though obviously the deceased cannot be brought back to life … in the absence of capital punishment, we are hoping for the maximum sentence to be given, especially for accused No.: 1, because she was the one who provided access to the murder. So, we are hoping for maximum sentence”.
