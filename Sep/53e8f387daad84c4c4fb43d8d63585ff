The Regional Task Teams of the African National Congress‘s Moses Mabhida and Lower South Coast in KwaZulu-Natal have been disbanded. The teams were tasked with preparing regional conferences after the party disbanded regional executive committees in the these regions. This followed internal squabbles among party members. Last month, the Moses Mabhida regional conference was abandoned at the last minute. This after some Regional Task Team members took the provincial leadership to court to demand the postponement of the regional conference. “Starting with the Lower South Coast the PEC came to a conclusion that it was not possible to convene successful and credible regional conference as a result the PEC mandated the PWC to reconfigure the regional task team of the Lower South Coast. On, Moses Mabhida region, the PEC discussed this matter and came to a conclusion that it was in the best interest of the ANC in Moses Mabhida region and the province in general to disband the regional l task team and currently assign the PWC and PEC members deployed to the region the responsibility to be in charge with the affairs of the organisation in the Moses Mabhida region,” says party provincial secretary Mdumiseni Ntuli.
