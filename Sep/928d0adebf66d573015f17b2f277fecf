Durban businessman Kessie Nair, who posted a video of himself insulting President Cyril Ramaphosa with the derogatory “K-word”, has been arrested. Nair was arrested on Wednesday and will appear in Phoenix Magistrates Court in KwaZulu-Natal on Thursday morning. In a video that is being circulated on social media platforms, Nair is calling for Ramaphosa to be charged for what he calls oppressing and failing South Africa. Nair says he is prepared to face the full might of the law if need be. Hawks spokesperson Hangwani Mulaudzi says they are taking the suspect to the Phoenix Magistrate’s Court where he will be charged with crimen injuria. Nair has a previous conviction of fraud. He was sentenced to six years in prison and served four before he was released. He says that his time in prison led to his belief that government is not doing enough to curb crime and unemployment. Nair says he is prepared to go to court and back to jail if needs be. “I don’t believe in the law that’s been created by man. It’s an illogical law. But I am prepared to respect it. If the law feels I got to appear in court I will come with no attorney. I’ll be there before anyone else.” He, however, says that he is prepared to retract the statement against the President.
