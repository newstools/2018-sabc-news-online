Durban has been named as the fifth wealthiest city in Africa, according to a report released by New World Wealth and Afr-Asia Bank in Mauritius. The top five cities also include Johannesburg and Cape Town. KwaZulu-Natal MEC for Economic Development, Tourism and Environmental affairs, Sihle Zikalala says this listing speaks volumes about the quality of investments in the city, and the province. Zikalala says the aim now is to ensure that other cities in the province also benefit from the upsurge of wealth. “But in the context of our own situation it also imposes a responsibility to continue to grow the economy but ensure that it is also distributed to as many people as possible it is good to be the wealthiest city but it also requires that the wealth is spread to many people”.
