The Freedom Front Plus (FF+) in Gauteng has laid complaints with the Gauteng Legislature’s Integrity Commissioner against Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi for alleged breach of the Constitution. The party accused Lesufi and his department of refusing Afrikaaner learners to be taught in Afrikaans and also denying Afrikaaner schools to be strictly white. This comes in light of the MEC pushing for learners from other races to be included in Afrikaans-only medium schools. However Lesufi has dismissed the complaints as frivolous and a wasting of time. He said, “They can’t postpone non-racialism. Non-racialism is going to happen and it is going to happen now. Our children deserve to study together, play together and share the opportunities of this country together. There’s no way that our tax money can be used to subsidise privileges of the few. All schools belong to South Africans and all South African children deserve to use those schools.”
