Lawyer Brian Currin has told the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture that before a decision was taken to release the data on the hard drives which has since been dubbed “the Gupta emails”, Stan, who was in possession of the information, needed to be assisted to first leave the country with his family. This was because they were concerned about their safety. Currin is giving testimony before Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo on how two whistleblowers Stan and John came to be in the possession of hard drives which the commission’s legal team has applied to be submitted as evidence. Stan and John were in possession of the hard drives containing emails and communications between the Guptas and representatives of government and state-owned enterprises. Currin says he cannot shed light on how the two whistleblowers obtained the data, as it may jeopardise their safety.
