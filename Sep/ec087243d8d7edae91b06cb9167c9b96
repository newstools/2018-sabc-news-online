Midvaal Mayor Bongani Baloyi has been attacked at the Savannah City development, south of Johannesburg. He says he was about to address a crowd at the launch of Arbor Day when a group of about 15 people confronted him. The mayor says they initially tried to prevent him from ascending to the podium, and things got out of hand when he refused to give in. Baloyi says he went to the De Deur Police Station to open a case. The DA mayor believes party politics may have been involved. “I’ve just been attacked by ANC members in Ward 11 in Savannah City. As I insisted to talk, to deliver the message to the community, they proceeded to the podium to try and rip the mic away from me and pushed me aside, and I pushed back to them… ” “…to the guy, ANC member there, and he picked up a rock and attacked me with it and hit me in my mouth and my face with it. So I’m at the police station at this stage to report the case,” adds Baloyi.
