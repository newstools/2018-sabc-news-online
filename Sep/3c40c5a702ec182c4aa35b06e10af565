The National Student Finacial Aid Scheme says R1 billion will be paid this week in an effort to clear payment backlogs. This is in addition to the R2.2 billion paid out in the past two weeks on students’ funding for the last financial year. The students’ loan scheme has been marred by challenges, including the non-payment of students’ funds. The scheme has made headlines in recent months due to the non-payment of funds resulting in massive backlogs for the 2017/2018 academic year. A few months ago, Higher Education Minister Naledi Pandor halted the application process for the 2019 academic year. An administrator was appointed last month to rectify the situation. He says several processes are under way to ensure that students receive their study funds.
