The South African National Taxi Council (Santaco) has called on its members in Klerksdorp in the North West to keep calm and let the law take its course, following Monday’s violence and looting in the town. North West Premier Job Mokgoro has condemned the violence. It’s reported that local taxi operators clashed with foreign nationals after hearing reports that a foreign national had killed a taxi operator, whose body was found lying on the street with stab wounds. A Zimbabwean national was later killed. Twelve suspects have been arrested for public violence and possession of suspected stolen goods. They have been granted R500 bail each, and are expected to appear before the Klerksdorp Magistrates Court on Tuesday. Professor Mokgoro has called on residents of Klerksdorp not to take law into their hands and to cooperate with police, so that those responsible for murder of the two people can be brought to book.
