A 35-year-old woman is due to appear on Thursday at the Mtubatuba Magistrates Court, in northern KwaZulu Natal, for kidnapping a day-old baby. Police spokesperson Thulani Zwane says the 18-year-old mother was in a taxi with the suspect who asked to hold her baby. Zwane says the suspect then disappeared with the baby after sending the mother to get airtime at the garage. He says a manhunt was launched immediately, and with the help of the Makhambane community, the missing child was found. “It is alleged that the community members then followed up information at Makhambane area where they found this woman with the baby and when they woman was questioned she then admitted that she stole the baby and police were called and she was immediately arrested. The baby is well and she was taken to hospital for treatment. The woman was then charged accordingly and she will appear on Thursday at Mtubatuba magistrate court”.
