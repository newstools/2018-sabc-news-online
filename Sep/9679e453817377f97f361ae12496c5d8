President Cyril Ramaphosa has told Chinese business people that policy certainty will go a long way in helping South Africa become an attractive investment destination. He was addressing a business breakfast in Beijing on his state visit to China. As well as hundreds of Chinese business people, the event was attended by former President Kgalema Motlanthe, former Finance Minister Trevor Manuel and the presidents of the Black Business Council and Business Unity South Africa respectively, Sandile Zungu and Sipho Pityana. Ramaphosa’s comments on policy certainty come as potential investors in South Africa worry about the country’s land reform programme. Ramaphosa arrived in Beijing on Saturday. At least 10 more trade and investment agreements are also set to be signed during Ramaphosa’s visit. The President will also co-chair the two day meeting of the Forum on China Africa Cooperation. President Ramaphosa is on a reciprocal visit following the Chinese president’s trip to South Africa last month. The two countries have elevated their relations to a comprehensive strategic relationship. Ramaphosa is expected to lay a wreath at the Monument of the People’s Heroes in Tiananmen Square. This will be in remembrance of those who lost their lives in the Chinese people’s wars for liberation, independence and freedom. He will also meet the Chinese Premier Li Keqiang at the Diaoyutai Guest House. The two countries enjoy cordial relations with over 10 agreements signed in July. The two presidents will assess the implementation of these agreements and find ways of strengthening them.  Related video
