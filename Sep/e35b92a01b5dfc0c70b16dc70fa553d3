Democratic Alliance (DA) leader Mmusi Maimane is expected to lead a picket outside the venue of the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture when it reconvenes in Parktown, Johannesburg, on Thursday morning. Maimane wants several senior members of the African National Congress (ANC), who have been implicated in state capture so far, to appear before the inquiry which Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo is chairing. The DA has already written to the secretary of the commission requesting that 12 ANC witnesses appear before the commission and explain their alleged role in state capture. The DA leader’s spokesperson Portia Adams says Maimane will be joined by other party leaders and supporters. “We have identified those people as well; we have mentioned the likes of Ace Magashule, Gwede Mantashe, former president Jacob Zuma and others to come before the commission to testify for their role into state capture,” adds Adams. “You would know that since the inquiry started, these people have been mentioned in the state capture [inquiry] by various witnesses who have come before the commission. And so, based on the fact that they have already been mentioned and also based on the emails that were in the public domain [they should appear before the inquiry],” explains Adams.
