Three ANC regions in the North West have announced that they have officially made written submissions to Luthuli House, to ask it to immediately rescind what they call, the factional decision to disband the North West Provincial Executive Committee. They argue that the move is unconstitutional, and set to only serve the interests of those that wanted to settle political scores against former party chairperson and premier Supra Mahumapelo. They held a joint media conference in Christiana, at the Lekwa-Teemane municipality on Monday. Speaking on behalf of the three regions, Gaolatlhwe Kgano, Ruth Mompati, the regional secretary said they want the NEC to respect the constitution. “This was a predetermined decision. We call the NEC to respect the constitution by allowing the current PEC to complete the remaining six months term in office and to ensure that the change of leadership in the province remains the democratic right of the branches instead and not through a factional flexing muscles as NWC and NEC members”.
