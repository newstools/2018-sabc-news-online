A police officer from the organised crime unit will continue giving testimony when the case against a former ANC employee and his three co-accused resumes in the Roodepoort Magistrates Court, west of Johannesburg, on Tuesday morning. Former Luthuli House staff member Velile Errol Present, Zakhele Zondi, Itumeleng Manama and Bheki Biyela are accused of involvement in the cash-in-transit heist in Dobsonville, Soweto, in July this year. They face charges of armed robbery, attempted murder and possession of hijacked motor vehicles. During the last court appearance Velile Errol Present detailed how he and his wife were assaulted by the police who questioned him about the heist. He says a plastic bag was put over his head and water poured over him resulting in him suffocating and then collapsing. However, his co-accused Bheki Biyela denied knowing of the alleged cash in transit heist he’s accused of having committed. A police officer from the organized crime unit in Johannesburg will continue testifying how armed men shot and robbed G4S security officers’ money they had come to deliver loan onto an ATM at the Dobsonville Mall on the 5th of July. A security guard was injured. The accused are applying for bail.
