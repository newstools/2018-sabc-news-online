Chairperson of the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture, Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo, has granted some implicated persons leave to cross-examine witnesses whose evidence they have called into question. Justice Zondo was listening to requests made at the inquiry in Parktown, Johannesburg. He has granted businessman Fana Hlongwane permission to cross-examine former deputy finance minister Mcebisi Jonas, while former President Jacob Zuma’s chief of staff Lakela Kaunda and Hawks official Mandla Mtolo will both be allowed to question Vytjie Mentor. Justice Zondo has reserved judgment on the applications by other implicated persons. A member of the legal team for the Commission, Vincent Maleka, has questioned the Gupta brothers’ conditions for testifying. Legal representative for the Guptas, Mike Hellens, argued that it was not necessary for his clients to appear before the commission to allow for cross-examining implicated witnesses. The Guptas have submitted an affidavit stating the reason why they won’t come to the inquiry. They say they can only testify if alternative arrangements are made to meet at another place or via video link. Hellens argued that the Guptas fear they are fugitives from justice in South Africa and will be arrested if they come to this country to testify. Maleka says the conditions set out by Ajay and Rajesh are not in the public interest. Click link for more
