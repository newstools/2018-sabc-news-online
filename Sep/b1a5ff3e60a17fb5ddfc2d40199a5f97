Three firefighters were killed in the massive blaze that engulfed the top of the building on Wednesday. Over 20 other people were hospitalised. One of the firefighters fell to his deathâ€š and two others were found inside the building, which houses three Gauteng government departments. Dozens of firefighters are still battling the massive blaze which has spread to the 16th floor as well other smaller parts of the building. All roads around the building have been blocked off to traffic as fire engines, police as well as emergency services, line the streets. The pavement and roads around the building are also strewn with shattered glass from the windows which broke as a result of the fire. Firefighters at the scene say it will take them several more days to completely put out the blaze. The Gauteng government has confirmed that the building was 21% compliant with safety regulations.
