President Cyril Ramaphosa returns to the National Council of Provinces (NCOP) on Tuesday for oral replies. Both President Cyril Ramaphosa and his Deputy David Mabuza will be in Parliament this week. The National Assembly plenary will debate three issues of national importance Tuesday and Wednesday. They are on the plight of Fees Must Fall activists, ideas for economic revival following recession and the escalating fuel price. Questions to the President include, whether the Youth Employment Service includes work experience in the private sector and the implementation of lifestyle audits, from the ANC and the DA. The EFF asks whether he has prepared for the consequences of land expropriation without compensation. He will also face questions on the multi billion rand loans to Eskom and Transnet by the Chinese Development Bank and Donald Trump’s remarks on land reform. Also this week, the police committee will be briefed on the annual crime statistics and later by IPID on high profile cases it is investigating. The department of Mineral Resources briefs the committee on allegations of state capture. The IFP motion on the escalating fuel price crisis and a DA motion on how South Africa slipped into a technical recession will also be debated this week.
