Another train carriage is on fire in the Cape Town area, this time at Strand Station. It’s not clear at this stage whether the carriage was deliberately torched. Arson attacks and vandalism of trains have often disrupted railway services in Cape Town and surrounding areas in recent weeks. Fire spokesperson, Theo Layne says rescue services are on the scene. “The city’s fire and rescue service responded to Strand railway station where they are dealing with one railway coach that’s alight. The fire is contained to a single coach at the moment.” “We have 12 firefighters with two fire engines and one water tanker on the scene.” He says the cause of the fire is undetermined and will be investigated.
