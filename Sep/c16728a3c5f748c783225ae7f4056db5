Eight workers, who died in an explosion at weapons manufacturer, Rheinmetall Denel Munition, on the 3rd of September, have been honoured at a memorial service. The service was held by the company in Somerset West, outside Cape Town, on Thursday. Many of the deceased had given decades of service to the weapons manufacturer. A little more than two weeks later, they were honoured at a memorial service held by the company. Jacob Jaftha spoke highly of his colleague, Nico Samuels. He also used the opportunity to apologise to Denel management for the community’s backlash and criticism after the explosion. “We thank our heavenly father for the 41 years God granted him; managers who entrusted him to become a leader. Thank you for the support of company and community. We want to apologise for what some members of the community said the night of the incident. Norbet Schulze doesnt deserve that… unacceptable. Management have described the deceased as dedicated and hardworking employees,” says Jaftha. The CEO of Rheinmentall Denel Munition, Norbet Schultze, also paid tribute to the eight men. Schultze reaffirmed the company’s support to the bereaved. “We need only to look around us to see the number of people gathered here today that these men mattered. These men were a vital and integral part of this company. Everybody in this company matters.” The explosion occurred in a building used for mixing propellants for artillery charges. It destroyed the entire building as well as the immediate surrounding blast walls. While the investigation into the cause of the explosion is still ongoing, it’s believed the explosion may have been caused by an ignition propellant. Funeral arrangements are yet to be confirmed.
