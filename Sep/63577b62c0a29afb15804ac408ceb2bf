Travel regulations for foreign minors travelling to South Africa have been eased. Foreign minors travelling to the country will no longer be required to prove parental consent. Travellers are however advised to carry necessary documents as immigration officials will insist on documents by exception such as in high risk situations. The department says it will issue an international travel advisory before the end of October. The relaxation of visa regulations is part of President Cyril Ramaphosa’s stimulus package to revive the economy. Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba briefed the media on the changes in Pretoria. Gigaba says this will only apply to foreign minors. He says South African minors however will still be required to prove parental consent when leaving the country as is required by the Children’s Act. These changes will be implemented by the festive season when many people will be traveling with children. “We will train officials on the revised regulations to ensure smooth implementation,” adds Gigaba.
