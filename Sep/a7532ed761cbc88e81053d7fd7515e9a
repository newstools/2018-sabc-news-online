The EFF in the Eastern Cape says it’s all systems go for its provincial elective congress scheduled for the weekend in East London. The party says all regions have already elected their regional leadership as part of the preparations for this conference. More than 1 000 delegates are expected to participate. The national office disbanded the provincial leadership after the party did not do well in the 2016 local government polls. EFF national chairperson Adv. Dali Mpofu says after they have convened the conference they will shift focus to the upcoming 2019 elections. “The future of democracy lies in the political parties themselves subjecting themselves to their membership so that you that if you are a leader you know that you are enjoying the support of the people on the ground so we are very confident going to 2019 that we are going to surprise many people and our performance is going to shake the country like we did in 2014”. However, some EFF members in the province say everything is ready. “The Eastern Cape is ready; the morale is very high everything will be fine after the conference. We are very excited about this coming event and we have been ready for it from day one I felt like it’s been too long”.
