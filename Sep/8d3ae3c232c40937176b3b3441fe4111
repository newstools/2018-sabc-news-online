Small and emerging women-owned businesses in uMsinga in the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands have been given a shot in the arm. They have received funding of more than R1 million from a non-governmental organisation in the area. The money will help grow their enterprises. The area is among the poorest in the country. Unemployment is rife with most households surviving by selling their livestock. Small businesses and co-operatives owned by women in the area have been given R1.2 million to help them expand. Something Amazing project’s Zodwa Majozi says:”We own a bakery in this area, we bake cakes and bread. We are now going to supply our product to all the shops nearby and our aim is to help this community to create job opportunities, as many people are struggling.” The foundation says incidents of women abuse here are also rife. It says it aims to uplift women who sometimes have to raise children on their own. Bahle Zondo Foundation’s Bahle Zondo says:”We are trying to bring a solution for our women whereby by starting these co-ops and the funding that they will receive. We want them to be self-sustainable not dependant on their male counterparts.” Zondo says the partnership will go a long way towards assisting and uplifting rural women. WATCH BELOW:
