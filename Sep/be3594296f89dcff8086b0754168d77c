Eastern Cape law enforcement officers will be on high alert on Wednesday as taxi council Santaco embarks on a provincial strike. Santaco is accusing Safety and Liaison MEC Weziwe Tikana of not taking the taxi industry seriously. They are demanding a fuel escalation fee for scholar transport operators. Tikana says she is hoping that members of Santaco will work with the law enforcement officers in this regard. She says: “Our members of SAPS are always ready but we don’t expect any criminal activities to take place there but should there be anyone transgressing, police will be ready to act.”
