The Mayoral Committee Member for Safety and Security in the City of Cape Town, JP Smith, says Police Minister Bheki Cele will continue to undermine the plight of residents in crime-ridden communities because he has no solutions to policing failures. Smith and the ward councillor of Bonteheuwel on the Cape Flats, Angus McKenzie were forced to leave a meeting between residents of the area and police management. The meeting followed Tuesday’s protest by residents to highlight unemployment, crime and poverty in their areas. Smith says they were invited by Cele. “The plight of the residents in crime ridden communities continues to get undermined by a lack of police on our streets. I am deeply worried that the genuine concerns of crime ridden communities are being hijacked by political interest, specifically in Bonteheuwel.” “I had hoped that the minister would come to the community of Bonteheuwel with solutions, answers and interventions.” Cele says their role is to help fight the scourge of crime in all affected communities Click video below:
