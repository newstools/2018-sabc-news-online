The Eastern Cape government on Friday will hold a commemoration and cleansing ceremony for the Bhisho Massacre in the town. In 1992, 28 people were killed and dozens wounded when soldiers acting on the orders of the former Ciskei bantustan leader, Brigadier Oupa Gqozo, opened fire while more than 80 000 people marched to Bhisho to demand his removal. Two years ago, the provincial government established a foundation to assist families of the deceased and the wounded with their educational and health needs. Arts and Culture spokesperson, Andile Nduna, says the day is a very important on the calendar. “The seven of September is a very historical day of the Eastern Cape Province. This day we are then commemorating those who passed on and their blood paved a way forward to the democratic South Africa we have today. Honourable MEC Bulelwa Tunyiswa will be led by the Premier Pumulo Masualle. He will therefore lead the commemorations and will also be joined by the South African Council of Churches.”
