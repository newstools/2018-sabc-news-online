The head of United Nations Women Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka has expressed her sadness and condolences to the family of Edna Molewa. “Very respected, fondly appreciated here in the UN, a regular participant on important UN forums, so I hope that her family will be consoled that she really made a difference during her life and her time.” Tributes continue to pour in for Molewa who passed away unexpectedly on Saturday. United Nations Deputy Secretary General Amina Mohammed worked closely with Molewa when she was the Environment Minister of Nigeria. The funeral will take place on the sixth of October. The announcement was made by her brother, Fana Mmethi in Pretoria. President Cyril Ramaphosa earlier said that Molewa will be accorded an official funeral by government. Molewa died on Saturday from complications of Legionnaires’ disease, a severe form of pneumonia that is spread through the inhalation of droplets of water that contain Legionella bacteria.
