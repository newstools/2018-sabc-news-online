COPE deputy president, Willie Madisha, has distanced himself and the executive of COPE from the briefing between AfriForum and COPE leader Mosiuoa Lekota. Lekota and AfriForum held a media briefing on Monday morning, claiming that COPE and AfriForum will work together against the expropriation of land without compensation.   Lekota and Afriforum said they will mobilise the international community and embassies to force the SA government not to amend Section 25 of the Constitution to expropriate land without compensation. In an exclusive interview with SABC News, Madisha says it was not a COPE decision but a unilateral decision by Lekota. “We don’t have any information whatsoever about the meeting which was held between Lekota and Afriforum. We therefore want to say if that meeting indeed was held, it was not an official meeting. At least, in our own understanding, we were not given any information. We did not give any mandate. We shall go into discussions but I can say that it’s not official from the side of the executive.”
