The ANC says she will always remain a symbol of rare social and political activism. Molewa rose in the ranks of the democratic South Africa since her involvement in the trade unions before joining the North West Provincial government as MEC in various departments before being a Premier of the province. Her role was noticeable and she was affirmed as a leader of the ANC NEC, NWC and a Cabinet Minister in various departments. The ANC says the history of South Africa will not be complete without acknowledging the pivotal role that individuals like her played in enhancing the impact of the collective effort to make South Africa a better place.
