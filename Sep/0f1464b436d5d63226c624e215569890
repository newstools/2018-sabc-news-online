Police union,  (Popcru) has expressed its concerns about the state of affairs within special crime investigative unit, Hawks. The Hawks has recently been under spotlight following the suspension of head of anti-corruption task team, Major-General Zinhle Mnonopi. Mnonopi was suspended in the wake of allegations made by former Deputy Finance minister, Mcebisi Jonas, during the State Capture inquiry. In his testimony Jonas told the inquiry probing state capture that Mnonopi tried to force him to sign a false statement. After its two day NEC meeting, Popcru says while it doesn’t want to react to allegations made at the Commission, the union has expressed its concerns. It says that the Hawks is faced with leadership crisis which has lent it to being ineffective. Meanwhile, with Cosatu’s 13th national congress fast approaching, Popcru kept mum on its leadership preference. It is understood that the name of current second deputy, Zingiswa Losi, has been gaining traction within Cosatu affiliates to succeed Sdumo Dlamini, who it is said will not be contesting for re-election.
