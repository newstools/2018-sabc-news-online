A police officer has told the Roodepoort Magistrate’s Court, in the west of Johannesburg, that they have positively identified a former African National Congress (ANC) employee and his three co-accused at an identity parade. Solomon Mabasa of the Johannesburg Organised Crime Unit has been testifying in the case of the four accused of involvement in a cash-in-transit heist in Dobsonville, Soweto, in July this year. They include former Luthuli House employee Velile Errol Present. Mabasa says the two vehicles used during the cash in transit heist have been positively linked to the accused. He also told the court that the four have also been positively identified during an identity parade.  He believes the state has a strong case against the four accused.  Mabasa says the three accused have previous convictions. He says Velile Errol Present has a reckless driving offense of which a warrant of arrest was issued after failing to appear in court. Mabasa says the accused should not be released on bail as this will put witnesses lives in danger as they are known to them. Watch related video below:
