It’s been reported that a fire, which broke out on Wednesday at a building in the Johannesburg CBD, is spreading to other floors. Firefighters are continuing to battle the blaze, which ripped through the Bank of Lisbon building. Three firefighters died while battling the blaze. One of them fell to his death from the top floor of the 23-storey building. The building housed three Gauteng Departments and there’ve been concerns about its failure to adhere to safety regulations. Johannesburg Emergency Services Spokesperson, Robert Mulaudzi says the fire has caused a lot of disturbances. “We can confirm that the fire has reignited at the building along Albertina Sisulu and Pixley Seme. Our firefighters are on sight. Most parts of the streets between Albertina Sisulu and Pixley Seme are closed. Motorists are urged to use alternative routes”. However, Gauteng Infrastructure Development MEC Jacob Mamabolo says they were in the process of getting rid of unsafe buildings in the Johannesburg CBD, when the blaze ripped through the building. There have been concerns raised about the department’s failure to adhere to safety regulations at the building. Mamabolo says they are finalising the appointment of a service provider to give them a building. “Four to five months ago we started with the process of finding a building for the COGTA department and we have already appointed a service provider to provide them with an alternative building. The Department of Human Settlements – this week we were finalising the appointment of a service provider to give them a building. So fire is an accident and something nobody can foretell. Even new state of the art buildings can catch fire. That is why the causes must be found and we must investigate”.  Watch below for more:
