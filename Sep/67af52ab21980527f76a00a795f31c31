South Africans have 30 days to make inputs to the Draft White Paper on Science, Technology and Innovation (STI) released by the Department of Science and Technology in Pretoria on Monday. The draft is intended to use STI to address South Africa’s socio-economic challenges.   This draft paper emphasises inclusivity, transformation and partnership to address policy coherence, human capital, development, knowledge expansion, innovation performance and increased investment. Science and Technology Minister Mamoloko Kubayi-Ngubane says, “Our next step is to release this draft white paper for public consultation. Members of the public have thirty days to make inputs. After the comments have been received and integrated we intend to have a summit on the 9th of November 2018 to engage various stakeholders on the white paper prior to us taking it as a final document for approval in cabinet.”
