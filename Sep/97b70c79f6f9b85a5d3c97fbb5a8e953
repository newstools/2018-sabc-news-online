Political analyst, Keith Gottschalk, says the DA appears to have abandoned its ambitions to become the majority party nationally after 2019’s general elections. He was reacting to reports that DA leader Mmusi Maimane, has his sights set on the position of premiership of the Western Cape. Other contenders include DA leader in the province, Bonginkosi Madikizela and the Provincial Economic Opportunities Minister, Alan Winde. “In addition to choosing a national leader to step down from Parliament to a Provincial Legislature to aim at the Cape rather than Gauteng would seem to me that the DA has realistically assessed that it doesn’t have a chance of capturing Gauteng in the 2019 elections.” Watch related video below
