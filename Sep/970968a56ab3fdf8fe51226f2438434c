A total shutdown has been planned in various communities across the Western Cape for Tuesday. Organisers say it’s in protest against rising poverty, crime and unemployment levels. Latest police crime statistics show that Nyanga on the Cape Flats has the highest murder rate in the country with over 300 murders committed in the area between April 2017 and March 2018. More than 800 gang-related murders were committed for the same period in the province. “We are tired of living in a society of violence and poverty and social decay. It’s a peaceful coming together of communities into the street of a community to highlight our concerns and that we are speaking with one voice. Various communities across the Cape Flats, Manenberg, Bonteheuwel, Hanover Park, Langa, Gugulethu and Kensington,” said protest organiser Gatt Anza. Meanwhile, the City of Cape Town says  the planned  total shutdown is an illegal protest. Mayoral Committee Member for Safety and Security, JP Smith, says the city supports legal public protests, but it does not condone illegal marches. He says the South African Police Services will work the City of Cape Town to deal with any disruptions. “The problem is that this protest has not applied for a permit in terms of the  national regulations of Gathering Act.  So, this puts them in automatic conflict with SAPS. And we will likely see a replay of the kind of footage or situation of conflict between the South African Police Service and the shutdown marchers which is extremely unfortunate.”
