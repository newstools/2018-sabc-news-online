The ANC’s head of Presidency Zizi Kodwa says convicted fraudster, Kessie Nair needs to face the full might of the law for referring to President Cyril Ramaphosa with the derogatory K-word”. In a video that has been circulating on social media, Nair stands by his actions. He accuses Ramaphosa of oppressing and failing South Africa while not doing enough to fight crime and unemployment. Kodwa says South Africa has no place for such racist behaviour. He says: “If indeed he did this because he wanted to get attention, he must get that attention, he must get it in jail like. We are happy that police are already acting, looking for him and he will get that attention.” “There is no place for racists who use derogatory words to describe others in South Africa. We want the law to take its course and we want among others that our judiciary must send another message by sending him to jail,” adds Kodwa. Nair admits to a previous conviction of fraud. He was sentenced to six years in prison, and served four before he was released. He says that his time in prison led to his belief that government is not doing enough to curb crime and unemployment. “It will create curiosity, reaction by society. We have so many different political parties and each party playing to the electorate on how to achieve unity. No one wakes up one morning and decides to assassinate the President of the country. And it was something I thought about for 13 years after languishing in prison with the 26 gang and how to take the country forward when I got out.” Nair says he is prepared to go to court and back to jail if needs be. “I don’t believe in the law that’s been created by man. It’s an illogical law. But I am prepared to respect it. If the law feels I got to appear in court I will come with no attorney. I’ll be there before anyone else.” He, however, says that he is prepared to retract the statement against the President.
