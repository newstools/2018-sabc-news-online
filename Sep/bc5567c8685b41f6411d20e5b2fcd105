Three men have been killed in a suspected vigilante attack in Westlake near Tokai in the Cape Peninsula. Police spokesperson, Andre Traut, says their bodies were found early on Sunday morning with multiple stab wounds. Traut says the investigation is ongoing. “The circumstances surrounding the death of three male persons, all believed to be in their twenties, are being investigated following an incident in Ibis Way in Westlake this morning (Sunday). The motive for the murders is yet to be determined and it is still unclear what sparked the incident. It is however suspected that vigilantism could have played a role.” One of the parents, Hannie Hewitt, who lost one her sons in the incident, says it unfolded quickly. “He went to the shop to buy himself a cigarette. I said he must come to sleep and he refused; so he went out and I followed him wearing my petty coat and my top. Then I saw them hacking him with pangas and stabbing him with knives. I then fell on top of him but they continued to hack him all while I was lying on top of him. I said to them, you can see he is already dead what are you doing further, they did not care because they wanted him to be stabbed.”
