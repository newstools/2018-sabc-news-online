Chairperson of the Elections and Boundaries Commission in eSwatini, Gija Dlamini, says counting is almost complete at most of the polling stations. Dlamini says they have not received any formal complaints about the alleged manipulation of the elections. This is after six candidates raised concerns about a ballot box that was allegedly tampered with at Siphofaneni just outside Manzini. “That has to be reported to the commission and the commission will put investigation behind it. That goes as far as the courts and we expect that to be done as soon as possible as, maybe, before the end of the day so that counting can be ended before the end of the day or the following day.” Citizens of Eswatini say they hope that the majority of the people elected in the country’s parliamentary elections will be young people. On Friday, residents voted for 59 people who will represent them in Parliament. Click below for more on the story:
