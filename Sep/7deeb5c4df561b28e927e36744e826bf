The Peddie based children’s rights organisation, the Khula Development Project, says hospital management must be held accountable for the alleged rape of a 17-year-old mother by a bogus doctor in Mthatha in the Eastern Cape. It is alleged that a 30-year-old suspect entered the private hospital pretending to be a doctor and raped the mother who gave birth on Monday. The director of the project, Petros Majola says it’s a shocking incident. “Remember that hospital is not a tavern. When patients are in hospital, they should be safe. So the hospital must be held accountable for this incident and the family has a reasonable ground to litigate against this hospital, so that the hospital can pay but payment cannot erase the incident that has happened to this 17 year old. All I can say is that I’m very disappointed that in South Africa there are hospitals that operate like this and I am not happy actually, we will assist that family”.
