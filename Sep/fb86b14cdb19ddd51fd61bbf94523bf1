Marufu lived at former president Robert Mugabe’s Blue Roof property in Borrowdale, Harare. Marufu died at the Trauma Centre on Thursday evening. She was 83 years -old. In his condolence message, President Mnangagwa said Mafuru’s death came at a time when the former First Lady and her husband were not well. The Mugabe’s attributed their absence at President Mnangagwa’s Inauguration to ill-health. The former First Lady Grace Mugabe was away in Singapore where she has been receiving medical attention. But they sent their daughter Bona Mugabe to represent them at the inauguration. Mnangagwa has urged Zimbabweans to stand with and rally behind the Marufu and Mugabe families.
