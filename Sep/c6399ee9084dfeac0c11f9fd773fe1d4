Leaders of the Anglican Church of Southern Africa have declared their support for the Total Shutdown Movement in Cape Town and the Westbury community in Johannesburg. The Total Shutdown Movement grabbed national attention when various communities took to the streets earlier this week to protest against unemployment, crime and poverty in their areas.  The Community of Westbury also protested on Friday following a shooting incident that claimed the life of a woman and left her 10-year-old daughter critically injured.  Anglican Archbishop, Thabo Makgoba has called on all spheres of government to intervene. “We are appealing that when God’s people undertake peaceful marches like the shutdown campaign to highlight the plight and the pain of gansterism that they should really be understood. And that in crowd control, the police should not use ammunition that will hurt and harm them and I want to say to the local government and national government let’s put our hands together and make South Africa safe.” Watch the related video on the Westbury Shutdown below:
