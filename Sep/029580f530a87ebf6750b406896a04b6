A memorial service for late Environmental Affairs Minister Edna Molewa will be held in Pretoria on Thursday morning. The service will start at 10am at the Christian Revival Church in Silverlakes. Molewa died in a Pretoria hospital on Saturday at the age of 61 following a short illness. The memorial service is expected to continue until the afternoon. The African National Congress (ANC) has unveiled programmes to remember Molewa. Speaking on some of the activities during the 10 day mourning period, ANC spokesperson Pule Mabe says Molewa will be honoured during the planned NEC meeting next Friday. “On the 28th (September) there will be a memorial service at the NEC and the chair that mama Edna used to sit at will not be occupied on that day. There will be a candle light next to her chair as part of honouring this gallant fighter of our time. On the 29th of September the National Executive Committee will visit the family home. On Tuesday there will be a national memorial service of the African National Congress which will be addressed by the secretary general of the ANC. On Wednesday there will be a government memorial service. On Thursday there will be a memorial service of the ANC Women’s League. On Friday we are encouraging our comrades to go and attend the night vigil in Pretoria.”
