National Assembly Speaker Baleka Mbete, the Chief Whips of the four largest parties and two other whips in the NCOP and National Assembly are heading for Cuba on Friday. Parliament says the visit to Cuba follows an official invitation extended to Mbete from the Speaker of its National Assembly, Juan Esteban Lazo Hernández. It will be a five day visit starting officially on Monday next week. Mbete and House Chairperson Mmatlala Borotho will be accompanied by ANC Chief Whip Jackson Mthembu and ANC Deputy Chief Whip Doris Dlakude. DA Chief Whip John Steehuisen, EFF chief Whip Floyd Shivambu and the Chief Whip of the IFP Narend Sighn all form part of the delegation. Two other whips from the National Assembly and NCOP, Tasneem Motala and Regina Lesoma, will also join the delegation. Parliament says the delegation will engage with the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Foreign Investment. It says this will be in the context of lack of substantial commercial ties between the two countries despite their existing cooperation in other sectors. Parliament says the delegation  will also visit the Latin American School of Medicine and interact with South African students studying in Cuba.
