The African National Congress (ANC) Greater Tshwane Region Council Caucus says the suspension of City Manager Dr Moeketsi Mosola and the removal of Executive Mayor Solly Msimanga should be done as speedily as possible. The party briefed media in Pretoria on what it calls scourge of unabated corrupt activities, involving the mayor and the city manager. Dr Mosola is being accused of allegedly flouting the city’s supply chain management policy after the awarding of a tender to an engineering company called Glad Africa. The company was tasked with assisting city departments in rolling out their capital infrastructure programs valued at almost R12 billion. ANC Greater Tshwane Region Council Caucus Dr Kgoshi Maepa says the city must be placed under administration. “It is our considered view, as the ANC, that the Gauteng MEC of Cogta has no choice but to take the people of Tshwane seriously and place the city under administration using Section 139. The ANC has now officially written that the suspension of the city manager be concluded before 30 days at the September regular council meeting. We can no longer delay the suspension of the city manager. Moreover, the ANC will continue with its urgent motion of no confidence against the executive mayor at the scheduled September council meeting and lobby all political parties in council to vote with us.” Click below for more on the story:
