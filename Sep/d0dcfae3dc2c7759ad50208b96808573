The National Assembly has approved the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) Amendment Bill. The amendment follows a Constitutional Court ruling that directed Parliament to limit the powers of the Police Minister to suspend or remove the head of Ipid. Current Ipid Executive Director Robert McBride took the minister to court in 2015. This after the minister accused him of illegally changing the outcomes of an Ipid investigation report into former Hawks boss Anwa Dramat. Committee chairperson Francois Beukman has admitted that Parliament will not meet the deadline that the court has set. “A committee bill was developed and introduced on 30 July. The portfolio committee adopted the bill on 4 July nearly 2 months before deadline. It’s common cause an application will have to be made to the Constitutional Court for an extension of the deadline to allow the National Council of Provinces (NCOP)to also process the bill,” adds Beukman.
