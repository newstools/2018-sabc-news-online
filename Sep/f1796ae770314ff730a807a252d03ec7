Nine babies have died at the Rahima Moosa hospital in Johannesburg following a bacteria outbreak at the facility. Acting CEO of the hospital, Doctor Frew Benson, says they have conducted an investigation, but could not determine the cause of the outbreak. He says they have now increased control measures at the facility. “We had an investigation for NEC which is a nacrotic entrocolysis, it’s an inflammation of the bowel, particularly in premature babies… we did not find any intact cause for the outbreak. The fact that it affected about 43 babies… of which over the period of few months… nine of them demised. We do have strengthened infect control measures implemented at the hospital,” says Benson.
