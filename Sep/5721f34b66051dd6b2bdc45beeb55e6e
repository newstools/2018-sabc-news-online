They have been protesting since early hours of Tuesday morning in several townships across the city leading traffic chaos on the N1 and N2. SABC reporter, Berenice Moss says she’s been caught up in the traffic chaos for over two hours. “It’s been a chaotic time trying to get to work. A number of roads are closed.
