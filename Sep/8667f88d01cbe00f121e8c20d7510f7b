After a long awaited anticipation, the Democratic Alliance(DA) is on Wednesday expected to announce its Premiership candidate for the Western Cape . The announcement has been delayed twice after the DA leader, Mmusi Maimane was requested to stand for the position. Maimane has since declined. The announcement was initially expected to be made on Sunday but in a surprise twist, Maimane threw his hat into the ring at the request of a few members of the party’s federal executive. Maimane later withdrew from the race, stating that his number one priority is the national electoral objectives for 2019-elections. The remaining candidates for the position include the DA’s provincial leader Bonginkosi Madikizela, Economic Development Minister Alan Winde and Shadow Minister of Finance, David Maynier. Meanwhile, the DA has nominated Western Cape Community Safety Minister, Dan Plato, as the candidate for mayor to replace Patricia De Lille.
