The Human Rights Commission (HRC) says authorities should address the complaints of residents of Cape Town townships, rather than use force against protesters. Human Rights Commissioner in the Western Cape, Chris Nissen, visited Bonteheuwel after people were arrested during the protest. Residents from Manenberg, Bonteheuwel, Hanover Park, Langa, Gugulethu, Kensington and Ottery took to the streets to protest against rising poverty, crime and high unemployment levels. They staged a shutdown of a number of roads to highlight their problems. Police used stun grenades and a water cannon to disperse the crowds. Nissen also visited the Bishop Lavis police station where people are being detained. He says: “We are here to make sure there is stabilty, that people are being listened to and that the police carry out their responsibilities in a meaningful way.” He says the Commission will try to organise a meeting with community leaders and Minister Bheki Cele. Meanwhile police are continuing to monitor various areas following the protests. Brigadier Novela Potelwa has urged people to protest peacefully. “Police are monitoring the situation, and we are urging protesters to carry themselves in an orderly manner that does not infringe on the rights of others. In an effort to ensure free flow of traffic, our forces are still still deployed on the ground to monitor the situation.”
