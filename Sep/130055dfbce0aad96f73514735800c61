Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo has again called on the public to come forward with evidence at the Commission of Inquiry on State Capture. The Commission has resumed to hear applications by individuals who wish to cross-examine witnesses. Justice Zondo says he is heartened to hear that there are several high ranking members of the public service that are reported to want to give testimony. “I did see an article indicating that former Minister of Communications Sphiwe Nyanda and some past officials in Intelligence and or Secret Service Mr Njenje and Mr Shaik according to the article know something. They said according to the article, they would be prepared to give evidence to the Commission should they be called to do so. I just want to take this opportunity to commend them for their decision to come forward and make themselves available,” adds Zondo. Amongst those who wish to examine the testimony of previous witnesses are Ajay Gupta, businessman Fana Hlongwane and former Director General in the Presidency Lakela Kaunda.
