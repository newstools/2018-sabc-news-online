Pikitup employees have resumed refuse collection duties across Johannesburg, with armed escorts protecting them. This, after five suspects were arrested for allegedly assaulting and threatening to set alight the general manager of the waste management entity. The suspects were part of a group of protesters who had been picketing outside Pikitup offices in Braamfontein since Monday, demanding employment. The manager was able to escape unharmed. Pikitup spokesperson, Muzi Mkhwanazi, says trucks are being escorted by the Johannesburg Metro Police Department and SAPS.
