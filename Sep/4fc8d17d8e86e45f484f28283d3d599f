A large crowd from East London and surrounding areas have marched to the East London Correctional Centre, demanding the release of the jailed AbaThembu King Buyelekhaya Dalindyebo. Dalindyebo was sentenced in 2015 to 12 years in prison for kidnapping, assault, arson and defeating the ends of justice. The AmaBhele nation, who also recognises him as monarch, organised the march. Prince Langalibalele Mthunzi  Ngonyama of the AbaThembu and Lenge Mabandla of the AmaBhele say they cannot celebrate Heritage Day while their king is languishing in jail . “We are saying that the president has to look (at) these things and make a heritage a real heritage. We talk about these things …  We have to continue until the president release the King and we are praying that he listens to the calls.” Meanwhile, political parties such as Economic Freedom Fighter (EFF) and Azanian People’s Organisation (AZAPO) also joined the march. EFF National Chairperson Dali Mpofu and Azapo Provincial Secretary Chris Siwepu are calling on President Cyril Ramaphosa to grant the King a Presidential pardon. “It important that this march is happening on Heritage Day. This government must decide whether it wants the foreign laws over the indigenous laws and foreign law is seen to be superior and above our own law. Firstly, we are asking president to apply Section 82.4 sub section of one of the constitution that gives him powers to pardon the King,” says Mpofu.
