Thousands of mourners, dignitaries from various areas and representatives of political parties are expected to attend the funeral of the IFP’s stalwart David Ntombela. He was 93 years old. Ntombela died at his home in Piertermaritzburg after a short illness. He was one of the most prominent and feared members of the IFP in the 1980’s and 1990’s during the violence between his party and the UDF and later the ANC when it was unbanned in the early 1990’s. Ntombela will be remembered as a person who refused to testify at the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) hearings. IFP leader Nkosi Mangosuthu Buthelezi, senior members of the party and IFP members are expected to pay their last respect to Ntombela.
