Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) President Julius Malema has called on government to do away with the tendering system. Speaking at the second provincial elective conference in Mahikeng in the North West, Malema says the tendering system causes drastic delays to service delivery. The party will elect its new provincial leadership this weekend. The two-day conference seeks to find resolutions to improve party governance as well as elect a new leadership. Malema challenged the efficiency of the tendering system. “We want to do away with tenders because tenders are the reasons why service delivery is delayed. They delay service delivery because for them to build a road, they must advertise a tender. And then it will take six months before it is adjudicated. And after they adjudicate it, then there is a challenge to the adjudication. It must be re-advertised and then adjudicated afresh. It takes another year.” Malema also called on government to invest in rural areas by creating new industries. The party’s new provincial leadership will be announced on Sunday, when the conference concludes. WATCH RELATED VIDEO BELOW:
