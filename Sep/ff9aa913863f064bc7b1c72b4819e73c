One person has been killed and two others suffered serious injuries following a head-on collision on the N2 road near Berlin turn off outside King William’s Town in the Eastern Cape on Monday night. It’s alleged that both vehicles were travelling from opposing directions. Road and Transport spokesperson Unathi Binqose says the accident was very disturbing. “Indeed we can confirm that there was an accident near Berlin between King William’s Town and East London. Very disturbingly that one person has passed on and we are told that two others are critical injured, among those that are critical injured is a child and we do suspect that the three occupants of the vehicle that was involved in the accident were a family, a couple with their child. Unfortunately the woman passed on and the father and a child are in a critical condition in hospital”.
