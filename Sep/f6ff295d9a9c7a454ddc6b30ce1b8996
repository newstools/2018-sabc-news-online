Congress of the People (COPE) has challenged the African National Congress (ANC) secretary-general Ace Magashule to avail himself to the State Capture inquiry and stop playing innocent. Magashule was addressing the members of students’ organisation  Congress of South African Students (Cosas) in Bloemfontein and said he was ready to face the commission. Magashule was the premier of  Free State at the time that the controversial Estina dairy project at Vrede, now the subject of a court case was planned. COPE spokesperson, Dennis Bloom says Magashule is definitely implicated. “Ace Magashule must not pretend that he is not aware that he is already implicated before the Zondo commission. Under his leadership as the premier of the Free State Estina dairy farm came up and the R79.3 million under his leadership was spent at Gupta newspapers and television,”says Bloom.
