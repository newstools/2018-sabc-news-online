One of the two men arrested after a shootout with police in Soweto on Wednesday will appear in court, while the other suspect remains in hospital under police guard. Police in Ekurhuleni gave chase after recognising the vehicle that the suspects had been driving as the one that had been stolen during a house robbery in Witbank in Mpumalanga. The chase ended in Soweto where one of the suspects was critically wounded during the shootout with police. Policeâ€™s Kay Makhubele says they started the chase at Etwata up until Bara where the police cornered the white jeep. When they saw police chasing they started driving recklessly. Makhubele says police then shot at the vehicle where one suspect was injured. He was taken to Bara hospital and remains under police guard in a stable but critical condition.
