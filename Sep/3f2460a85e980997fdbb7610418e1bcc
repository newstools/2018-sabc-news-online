The Congress of South African Trade Unions’ (Cosatu) new President Zingiswa Losi has applauded outgoing President Sdumo Dlamini, saying he resolved many old problems workers of this country had struggled with. Losi was nominated unopposed for the position of president, making her the first woman leader of the labour federation. This follows elections at Cosatu’s 13th National Congress in Midrand. Losi has outlined some of the achievements under Dlamini’s leadership. “For the past nine years that we have worked with the President Sdumo Dlamini, we have achieved quite a number of victories of workers; not only in the federation, but in the country as a whole. You’d remember that president of the ANC spoke about the National Minimum Wage. That is the bill that would be signed soon into law which is a victory we have achieved under his stewardship. We have also achieved the issue of UIF, where there is an extension that is given from six-months to 12 months that you’re able to claim. Those are some victories but we look forward to a new era.” Click below for more on the story:
