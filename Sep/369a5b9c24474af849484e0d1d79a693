Cosatu has called for the arrest of those found to have been involved in corruption and that the State Capture Commission should do it’s work decisively. This was said on the last day of the trade union federation’s congress in Midrand, north of Johannesburg. General Secretary Bheki Ntshalintshali says the more than 2000 delegates attending the congress have unanimously agreed that President Cyril Ramaphosa must sign the minimum wage bill into law. He says the federation will embark on a national strike throughout the country against job losses. Ntshalintshali says in that process they will also look to recruit more workers to join the federation in order to intensity the fight. Watch video below:
