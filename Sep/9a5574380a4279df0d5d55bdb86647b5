The National Assembly paused on Thursday to remember the life and service of former United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan. He died last month at the age of 80 after a short illness. MPâ€™s were unanimous in their praise for the invaluable role Annan played in putting Africa on the world stage, and his tireless humanitarian efforts. The Nobel Peace laureate spent his retirement in a small village in Switzerland. His native Ghana is organising a state funeral set for the 13th of September 2018. WATCH RELATED VIDEO:
