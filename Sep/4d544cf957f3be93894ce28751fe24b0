African National Congress (ANC) spokesperson Pule Mabe says the leadership of the ruling party at all times seeks unity among members. Mabe says reports in a local weekend newspaper aims to to isolate the Secretary General of the ANC, Ace Magashule. He says the ANC dismisses any claims that there was a plot to oust current President Cyril Ramaphosa. “I can tell you now, that there’s no plot, and I sit in the collective of the National Executive Committee – and the ANC is focusing on the task of unity and renewal of the party.” According to the report, former President Jacob Zuma held a clandestine meeting with top ANC officials – including the party’s Secretary-General Ace Magashule, former North West Premier Supra Mahumapelo and ANC Youth League Secretary in KwaZulu-Natal, Thanduxolo Sabelo. The reports says the discussions were about a strategy to challenge the outcomes of the 2017 ANC national conference, which elected Ramaphosa.
