The police are turning the tide against police killings with the number of officers dying in the line of duty coming down over the past three years. 29 police officers were killed in the last financial year a significant decrease as compared to the 57 in 2016/2017 financial year. The fallen men and women in blue were honoured at the annual national SAPS commemoration day in Pretoria Sunday. Family, friends and fellow officers filled the seats of the Union Buildings to pay homage to those who’ve died in the line of duty. Police Minister Bheki Cele says police killings are undermining the integrity of the state. “Every weekend we bury police officers. Yesterday[Saturday] we buried 4, I attended one of those funerals. Everyone who kills police, you must have sleepless nights. You must know that we are coming for you because you have taken on the whole nation.” The killing of police officers has attracted media scrutiny and it does look like the disturbing picture is being turned around. Over 380 police officers were murdered in the last 5 years, the number has dropped from 84 in 2013 to 29 this year. The decline in deaths has been welcomed but concerns remain about attacks on law enforcement officers. September is Police safety month and the SAPS have vowed to increase their efforts to curb the onslaught on its members and work harder in fighting violence against women and children. There are also plans to change the training and curriculum of police trainees. Cele says new curriculum will better equip the police. “National commissioner and myself have agreed that going forward with the intake and recruitment process for police members, the training and curriculum of police officers must change. Their training will intensified to a level of TRT’s and include a streetwise course for our members to be able to adapt to any situation and occurrence they are faced with from day to day.”
