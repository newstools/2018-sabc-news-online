Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) leader Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi has denied claims that he and party strongman Thandabantu Ntombela were party to those killed during violence between the African National Congress (ANC) and IFP in KwaZulu-Natal. Buthelezi was speaking at Ntombela’s funeral in Elandskop, outside Pietermaritzburg were thousands came to bid farewell to Thandabantu Ntombela. Ntombela known as “Gandaganda” was a prominent IFP leader in the 1980s and 1990s, at the time, the IFP was at war with the United Democratic Front and later the ANC after its unbanning. The controversial Ntombela was fingered during the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) for allegedly inciting violence and leading IFP warriors during attacks. Ntombela was part of a 21 member committee responsible for negotiating peace. Inkosi Buthelezi defended him. “When Mr Ntombela passed Mr Makhanya calls us both cruel butchers, with not a thought to the grief of our families. Mr Ntombela took things to heart. He was deeply distressed by our people’s suffering, not only under the oppression of apartheid but under the anguish of an internecine civil war.” ANC NEC member Dr Zweli Mkhize also defended him. Ntombela’s son Thinasonke described his late father as a courageous man who devoted his entire life to building the IFP. “I don’t remember my father going out to go and attack anyone. All I remember is that people would call him for assistance when they were in trouble. He would resolve issues in his area. His methods were proper, maybe some people were affected by this. He was a man of courage and God made him that way. He had a beautiful soul and people adored him” Ntombela retired from politics in 2007 due to illness, but remained a loyal IFP member. He is survived by his five children and grandchildren.
