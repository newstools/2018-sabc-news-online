Two of the three firefighters, who lost their lives in the Bank of Lisbon building fire in the Johannesburg CBD last week, will be laid to rest this weekend. Khathutshelo Muedi will be laid to rest in Venda in Limpopo on Saturday. Mduduzi Ndlovu will be laid to rest on Sunday also in his home province of KwaZulu-Natal at the Doringkop Farm in Danhausser. The first to be buried was Simphiwe Moropana in Daveyton on Gauteng’s East Rand on Friday. The three responded to a call after a fire broke out on the 23rd floor of the building hosting three provincial government departments in town but never made it out alive. Johannesburg Mayor Herman Mashaba says every effort must be made to ensure that such a tragedy never happens again. He says these men lost their lives unnecessarily. “If we are to honour their memories, we must get to the bottom of what happened in the building. If we fail to do this, we would have failed to ensure that another tragedy like this one, which took place last week never happens again. We have to look closely at all buildings and ensure that working conditions are safe,” says Mashaba. Related Videos
