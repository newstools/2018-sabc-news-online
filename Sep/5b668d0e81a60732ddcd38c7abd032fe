Twelve people are expected to appear at the Klerksdorp Magistrate Court in the North West after violence and looting broke out on Monday. They face charges of public violence and possession of suspected stolen goods. The violence erupted when local taxi operators clashed with foreign nationals in the area. It allegedly started after one taxi operator’s body was found lying in the CBD with stab wounds. A Zimbabwean national was killed in the clashes. Police spokesperson Sabata Mokgwaabone says police continue to monitor the situation. He says police cannot say at this stage that it’s xenophobic attacks, the death of the Zimbabwean national is being treated as a separate incident. He says: “We will monitor the situation closely with the intention of making sure that we curb it before it gets worse.
