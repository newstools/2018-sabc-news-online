Investigations to determine the cause of a deadly fire that ravaged through a building in the Johannesburg CBD are expected to begin Monday. Mop-up operations are under way at the Bank of Lisbon building following a fire that began on Wednesday on the 23rd floor. Three firefighters died while trying to douse the blaze and will be laid to rest this coming week. The fire has now been completely extinguished. However, Johannesburg Emergency Management Services acting fire chief Arthur Mqwa says there has been significant structural damage to the building which was found to have flouted safety regulations. “The only problem that we’ve got is only 15 and 16th floor where the structural engineers determined that there is structural damage. On Monday our fire investigators will start to investigate what caused the fire also the Sap will start and also structural engineers will come to see whether the structure is … integrity there’s still strength.” Watch for more:
