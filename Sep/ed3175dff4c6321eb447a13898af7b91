The Democratic Alliance has urged President Cyril Ramaphosa to fire the Minister of Women in the Presidency, Bathabile Dlamini. This is after a damning Constitutional Court judgment which described her action during the Sassa debacle as reckless and grossly negligence. The court further ruled that Dlamini must pay 20% of the Black Sash and Freedom Under Law court costs. DA leader Mmusi Maimane has given the president five days to fire Dlamini. He says failure will result in him seeking a court order to compel him to do so. At the same time, the party’s shadow Minister of Social Development Bridget Masango is heading to the Cape Town central police station to lay perjury charges against Dlamini. “Dlamini was determined to deliberately derail the entire process of Sassa by procuring an alternative to place herself between constitutionally enshrined rights and those that are entitled to those rights.” Related video click below:
