The South African Institute of Race Relations says the Constitutional Court’s ruling on the use of dagga has affirmed the right of South Africans to make their own decisions. On Monday, the court announced the decriminalisation of dagga for private use, but says people may be arrested if they are suspected of being in possession of cannabis for dealing purposes. In welcoming the judgment, the Institute’s spokesperson Marius Roodt says people should be free to decide without interference from the state whether or not to use dagga in their own homes. “This shows, for people to use cannabis in their own home, shows that the court trusts South Africans as adults and people who can make decisions about their own lives. We need to trust South Africans to use cannabis responsibly.  Alcohol is already legal and majority of South Africans are not alcoholics. So, I don’t think this will lead to some kind of dagga epidemic in the country.” Click below for more on the story:  !function(e,t,n,s){var i="InfogramEmbeds",o=e.getElementsByTagName(t)[0],d=/^http:/.test(e.location)?"http:":"https:";if(/^\/{2}/.test(s)&&(s=d+s),window[i]&&window[i].initialized)window[i].process&&window[i].process();else if(!e.getElementById(n)){var a=e.createElement(t);a.async=1,a.id=n,a.src=s,o.parentNode.insertBefore(a,o)}}(document,"script","infogram-async","https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js");
