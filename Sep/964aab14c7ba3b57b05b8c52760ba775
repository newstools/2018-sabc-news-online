Four people have been shot and killed in two separate incidents in Ficksburg in the Eastern Free State. Members of the Haetlale Terene music group allege that they were attacked by a jealous rival group. Police say they are working round the clock to bring the suspects to book. Two people were killed during a night vigil in Meqheleng where three men suspected to be Lesotho nationals came inside a tent for a shooting spree. Two more men were shot dead at a different house not far from where mourners were at a night vigil. A friend of the late 22-year-old Molefe Mafereka is still reeling in shock. “I’m very weak at this moment because we had a meeting with the police prior to the funeral in Ficksburg and they promised us that they will look after us and we worked together with them but they failed us. We ended up being attacked by the enemy.” Ramapepe Khelane, a Haetlale Terene group member, claims that the incident has to do with jealousy. “What I know is that the attackers, we used to work with them and now they’ve developed jealousy towards us. They even ended up attacking us because of jealousy as we are all singers. This is all about jealousy.” Motantsi Makhele, Free State police spokesperson says that no arrests have been made so far. “This came out of a night vigil where two people were killed after they have been shot and six also suffered gunshot wounds and were taken to the hospital.” Six people were rushed to hospital with multiple gunshots wounds. Police say a task team has been established. Watch related videos below:
