The Economic Freedom Fighters in the Free State wants former Free State Premier, Ace Magashule, to appear before the State Capture Inquiry in Parktown, north of Johannesburg. The party wants Magashule to account for what it calls the looting of State coffers in the province. The Commission has heard that the Free State government had paid nearly R80 million to the Gupta-owned media. Newly-elected Free State EFF chairperson Mandisa Makesini says Magashule must account. “We really feel vindicated by the evidence that was presented in the Zondo commission as a province. But anyway we were not shocked by whatever that happened because we knew the province is the capital city of corruption. We call upon to the commission to call Magashule to come and present his evidence and we hope he will do honestly with fairness. We are also calling on government officials to come and present the evidence because they are the ones who’ve got evidence. What happened is the injustice for the people of the Free State.”
