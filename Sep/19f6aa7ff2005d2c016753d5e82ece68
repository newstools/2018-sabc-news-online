An investigation is under way after a woman and child were shot after being caught in a crossfire during suspected gang violence in Westbury, west of Johannesburg. The woman who’s 44 was killed and the 10-year-old child is in hospital. A man who was also wounded in the shootout has been detained for questioning. Police believe he might be one of the three people who were shooting at each other. Gauteng police spokesperson Lungelo Dlamini says, “We haven’t arrested anyone but there are witnesses. We’re busy interviewing. They might inform us who the people that might be involved are. Also we are questioning the man who’s at the hospital because he might know the people who were shooting at him.”
