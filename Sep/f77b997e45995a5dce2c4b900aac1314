The Gauteng Health Department has obtained a court interdict forcing all striking nurses to return to work immediately. Nurses at clinics in Sedibeng in Gauteng’s Vaal Rand downed tools on Thursday demanding that the Gauteng Department of Health remove the District Director who is accused of nepotism. Chief Director for District Health Services in the Gauteng Health Department Meisie Lerutla says, “As a department, we had a challenge of an illegal strike in Sedibeng District, which started yesterday where the unions initiated their illegal strike with the staff. We have now evoked a court order to manage the situation and we trust that by this evening the facilities that work overnight will start to be functional.”
