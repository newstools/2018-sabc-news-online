Kenyan orator, intellectual, legal expert and scholar Professor Patrick Lumumba says Zimbabwe’s economy is in the high dependency unit. He says Zimbabwe needs all the political oxygen that can’t be marshalled for it to be revived, so that the agriculture and mining sector can be revived and also unemployment situation can be dealt with. “The reality of the economy of Zimbabwe requires the administration of the Zimbabwe president Emmerson Mnangagwa to do certain things that are right and general good for the people. What I expect the Mnangagwa administration to do is to incorporate the opposition. I think this administration should be seen as a transaction administration and a government of Nation unity so that former presidential candidate Nelson Chamisa and his group are also included,” says Lumumba. Lumumba says, “Zimbabwe’s economy is in the high dependency unit and it needs all the political oxygen that can’t be marshalled for it to be revived, so the agriculture is revived, the mining sector is revived and so that the unemployment situation is dealt with.” “I believe Zimbabwe is on the mend, it is not going to be immediate, it is not going to be dramatic and people have to be vigilant and I think the SADC regions are to be useful in pushing them in that direction,” says Lumumba. Lumumba presented the acclaimed keynote address at the Nelson Mandela Memorial Lecture 2018. Click link for more  Click link for more
