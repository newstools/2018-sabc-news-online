Workers at Sasol affiliated to trade union Solidarity have embarked on strike at the petrochemical firm’s Secunda plant in Mpumalanga. The strike is over the shared scheme at the firm that is exclusively offered to black staff. Solidarity believes the scheme is discriminatory as it excludes white workers. Members of Solidarity have already started arriving at the plant. Solidarity’s Dirk Herman says, “Here’s lot of people – thousands of people standing outside everyone in the colours of Solidarity. They say here we are frustrated and what’s happening is really unacceptable.  It’s really a great spirit and at this stage a huge fest.” Click below for related videos…
