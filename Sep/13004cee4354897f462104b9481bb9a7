Eastern Cape residents living in remote areas of the province will soon be receiving health care services in the comfort of their homes. Health MEC Helen Sauls-August made this announcement at the historic Victoria Hospital in Alice. The hospital, which is celebrating 120 years of existence, was the first to train a black nurse, Cecilia Makiwane, during the apartheid era. But the decaying infrastructure at the hospital taints that history, for years this hospital has not been fenced, buildings are dilapidated and it has been struggling to attract doctors. Yet its hoping that a R20 million injection could restore it to its former glory. The Health MEC wants to put an end to long queues at public hospitals by getting doctors to go door-to-door to conduct immunisations, screening and testing. All of this is seen as a step closer to the National Health Insurance (NHI) programme. The department wants the hospital to be made a national heritage site.
