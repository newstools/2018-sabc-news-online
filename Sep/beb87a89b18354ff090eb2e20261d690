Parliament has apologised to the family of Lennox Garane, a staff member who shot himself dead inside the premises of the institution last week. Parliament says it takes full responsibility for his untimely death. It is not clear how a firearm was brought into the Parliamentary precinct. Speaking at the memorial service on Wednesday Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly Lechesa Tsenoli told Garane’s family and fellow workers that parliament could have done better by attending to Garane’s grievances long before the incident could happen. He says: “We say to the family we are deeply sorry that you have to go through this. We apologise, we could have done things differently but we didn’t.”
