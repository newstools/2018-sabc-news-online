Chairperson of Parliament’s Environmental Affairs Committee, Philemon Mapulane, has expressed shock at the passing of the Minister of Environmental Affairs Edna Molewa. Mapulane says while they were aware of her illness, they had expected her to recover. “We worked very well with the Minister. We had a good working relationship, but of course, in the nature of our relationship we are in oversight authority over Executive. So, we were not always agreeing on issues, but we had much and deep respect for the Minister. She was quite competent in her work.” Western Cape Minister of Local Government and Environmental Affairs Anton Bredell has also expressed his condolences to Molewa’s family. Bredell says he is shocked by the news. “We’ve worked as colleagues for the last eight years, although we have been on opposite sides of the political spectrum. We have tried to do our utmost best to better the environment within South Africa, and it was a privilege and honour to work with her and our prayers and condolences to her family and friends.” The Presidency confirmed her passing earlier. She was 61 years old. The presidency said she died in hospital in a Gauteng after being ill for some time. “The Presidency has sent condolences to her family; to her loved ones; and to her colleagues in Cabinet. He (the President) has also ordered that all flags must be flown at half-mast around the country and at all diplomatic missions abroad,” says Presidency spokesperson, Khusela Diko. The African National Congress (ANC) also expressed its sadness over Molewa’s passing. The party says her death leaves the party and the country poorer given her role in advancing the country’s transformational agenda. Molewa was appointed as Minister of Environmental Affairs in 2010 and was also a member of the ANC’s National Executive Committee and a former Premier of North West.
