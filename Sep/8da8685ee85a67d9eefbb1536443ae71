Statistics South Africa says jobs in the formal sector declined by 69 000 during the second quarter of this year. The latest figure puts the number of fully employed South Africans at 9.7 million people. Community services, which include government-related occupations, showed the biggest decline of nearly 70-thousand jobs. However, trade and business services have managed to increase the number of jobs. “Sectors which contributed to this decrease are as follows: community services with a drop of 67 000 due to about 66 000 employed in the March quarter to help with election registration… they are now laid-off. The second industry to show a drop is manufacturing, followed by mining with a drop of 2 000” says Matlapane Mashupye from Stats SA.
