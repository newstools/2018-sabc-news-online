Social Justice Coalition (SJC) activists will march to parliament on Tuesday to ask for the release of the nationwide guidelines for the policing of informal settlement areas. The SJC says this is part of the recommendations of the 2014 Khayelitsha Commission of inquiry into policing in the township. The commission also found that access to crime statistics could improve the relationship between the police and residents, but the SJC says the police continue to release statistics at station level once a year only. A memorandum of demands calling on Police Minister Beki Cele and the National police commissioner Khehla Sitole to act immediately will be handed over when they release crime statistics in parliament Tuesday.
