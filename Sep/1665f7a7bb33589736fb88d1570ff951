Democratic Alliance (DA) leader Mmusi Maimane says corruption has become the norm under the African National Congress (ANC) government. Maimane was addressing thousands of party members during the launch of the DA’s 2019 national election campaign at the Mary Fitzgerald Square in Johannesburg. The opposition party wants to wrestle power from the ANC in several provinces including Gauteng and the Northern Cape. He says corruption cannot be allowed to continue unchecked. Maimane says, “Our message speaks of fighting corruption and we’ve got to rid our country of this for good. Our country did not enter a new dawn after Jacob Zuma left because it’s clear nothing has changed. The same corrupt people that sold our country to the Guptas under Zuma are now senior lieutenants still in the government. No one is ever charged, no one has ever been prosecuted, no one has ever been fired.”
