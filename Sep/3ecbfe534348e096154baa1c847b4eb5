Democratic Alliance (DA) provincial leader in the Western Cape, Bonginkosi Madikizela has urged the party’s supporters not to be distracted, but instead focus on retaining the province after next year’s general election. The party launched its provincial campaign in Cape Town on Saturday. Madikizela, who failed to make it as a Premier candidate, says the party’s supporters must not be deterred by those who see race in everything. “Those people who will be using race to try and divide us colleagues we must understand that we are the only party in South Africa that is bringing together people from different backgrounds and that is not a weakness but our strength and therefore I want you to understand that what is at stake is our country.” WATCH RELATED VIDEO BELOW:
