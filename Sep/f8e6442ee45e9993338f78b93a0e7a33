The Democratic Alliance (DA) says its investigation into leaks of confidential party information to the media is being taken seriously. The party is investigating how Mmusi Maimane‘s intention to stand as Western Cape premier candidate was leaked last week. Provincial DA leader Bonginkosi Madikizela is reportedly amongst three DA leaders who have been asked to hand over their electronic devices, including cellphones and laptops, to the party. But he’s refusing, saying he’s not the source and his privacy is being invaded. DA Spokesperson Solly Malatsi would not comment on what will happen following Madikizela’s refusal to hand over his devices. Malatsi says, “Federal Executive has been consistently concerned about the leaking of information from private and confidential meetings of different structures of the party and it has now instituted an investigation into the leak of the scores and rankings of candidates in the Western Cape.” Watch video below:
