The Gauteng Member of the executive council (MEC) for Community Safety, Sizakele Nkosi-Malobane, says the community of Westbury, Johannesburg needs urgent intervention if they’re to be kept safe from gangsterism and drugs. Nkosi-Malobane addressed the community outside the Sophiatown Police Station on Friday following a violent protests against crime. The MEC promised that three police officers accused by residents of colluding with criminals will be removed from the local police station while their conduct is being investigated. “There are three officers that they said are not behaving correctly, meaning that they’re corrupt. So we said we will remove them now, temporarily. But also (we’ve) requested the community to submit affidavits in order to indicate how these officers are actually corrupt, in order for us to permanently remove them from the station, if they are corrupt. But if they’re not corrupt, we’ll have to bring them back.”
