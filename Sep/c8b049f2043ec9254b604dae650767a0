COPE says it’s time for former President Jacob Zuma and the Gupta family to face the full might of the law and be prosecuted for alleged corruption. This follows the signing of Treaties on Extradition and mutual legal assistance in criminal matters by Justice Minister, Michael Masutha and his UAE counterpart Sultan Saeed Al Badi. The move could see the Gupta brothers being deported to South Africa to face criminal charges. COPE Spokesperson Dennis Bloem says the two governments have done well in making that the justice system has the teeth when it comes to investigating corruption. “It is well known that the Hawks are investigating Jacob Zuma and the Gupta brothers for corruption and treason – a charge which COPE opened against them in 2016. The Guptas decided then to go and hide in Dubai. We are saying we are not going to leave this thing. The truth must come out.”
