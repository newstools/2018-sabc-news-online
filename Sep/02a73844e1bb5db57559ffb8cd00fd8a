SABC executives have not fully disclosed how many employees will be retrenched during their appearance before Parliament’s Communications Portfolio Committee on Tuesday. Board chairperson, Bongumusa Makhathini, told the committee that they are consulting unions and employees on implementing Section 189 of the Labour Relations Act. About 42% of the total revenue goes to the employees wage bill. “Do you have retrenchments on the presentation?  Just say yes or no – no explanation to say you are going to retrench so many, asked Committee chairperson, Humphrey Maxhegwana. “No, we have Section 189 process, because once you talk about retrenchments of workers and you say how many you think you will retrench, you will the raise a lot of discussion,” says Makhathini. Maxhegwana says retrenchments will be discussed in detail on another day. Meanwhile, SABC Chief Financial Officer, Yolande van Biljon, has told the committee that there’s no place for fruitless and wasteful expenditure at the public broadcaster. “With respect to fruitless and wasteful expenditure, it is an absolute no no. It really is a waste of money. We have seen significant improvement in that theme in the organisation in five years.  So, clear guidelines have been provided, review is in place and tracking is on-going.” Watch video below:
