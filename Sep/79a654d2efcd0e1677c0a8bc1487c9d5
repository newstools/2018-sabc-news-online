Environmental Affairs department says Minister Edna Molewa was highly respected worldwide due to her knowledge of environmental issues. The department held a memorial service for her in Pretoria on Thursday. Molewa passed on last Saturday at a Pretoria hospital aged 61. Many describe Molewa as a hard working individual who loved South Africa and her people. Molewa is credited for spearheading numerous projects, among them translocation of rhino from high risk areas to low risk areas. Environmental Affairs Deputy Minister Barbara Thomson says she’s honoured to have worked with Molewa. “One must say that she is highly, highly respected globally. Through her contributions, South Africa is recognised and respected as a major, major stakeholder on the issues. Indeed, her demise is not only a loss to South Africa, but to the entire world. Minister’s vast knowledge of the sector allowed her to lead the department with ease and passion.” Watch below for more:
