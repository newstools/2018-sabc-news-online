The African National Congress National Working Committee (ANC NWC) is expected to question party secretary-general Ace Magashule following his meeting with former President Jacob Zuma in Durban more than a week ago. Magashule has been in the spotlight in the past week, after a Sunday Times newspaper report alleged that Magashule’s meeting with Zuma and other ANC officials was a plot to remove President Cyril Ramaphosa from office. Magashule will have to explain to the party’s National Working Committee, why he met with former President Zuma. Magashule sparked headlines last week when it emerged that he had met with Zuma along with, former North West Premier Supra Mahumapelo, ANC Women’s League Secretary General Meokgo Matuba and KZN ANC Youth League Secretary Thanduxolo Sabelo and were reportedly plotting to oust President Ramaphosa. He has since rubbished these claims, and told the media that he met with Zuma to discuss organisational issues, however the ANC said it was not a party meeting. The NWC is also expected to question Magashule’s comments about the SABC, when he announced that the ANC would not allow retrenchments to go ahead at the SABC. He admitted that the party cannot dictate to the public broadcaster on what processes to follow regarding the looming retrenchments. Story by: Mbali Thethani
