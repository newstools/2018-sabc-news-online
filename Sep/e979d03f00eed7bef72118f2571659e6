The Communications Committee’s urgent request to call the SABC before Parliament has been approved. The meeting comes after the Public Broadcaster announced that it intends to invoke Section 189 of the Labour Relations Act which could see the retrenchment of hundreds of workers to cut costs. House Chairperson of Committees Cedric Frolick has confirmed the meeting will take place next week. Frolick says he has acceded to the request of the Communications Committee to call the SABC for an urgent meeting on Tuesday next week. He says the only outstanding thing is the approval of the Chief Whip because MPs are currently in their constituencies over the next two weeks. On Tuesday, Communications Committee Chairperson Humphrey Maxegwana said they want the SABC Board to present the public broadcaster’s turnaround strategy. Maxegwana said the committee only learnt about the retrenchments through the media, while the Board has not yet presented its turnaround strategy to the committee. Watch related video below:
