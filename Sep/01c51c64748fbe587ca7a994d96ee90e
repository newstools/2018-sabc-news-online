African National Congress (ANC) MP Vincent Smith will only know after Wednesday’s ANC Political Committee meeting whether his request to step aside as chairperson of various committees has been granted or not. Smith requested to step aside until the Ethics committee has concluded its investigation into his alleged conduct. He recently made headlines following allegations that he received payments of close to R700 000 from Bosasa Security Company starting in 2015. Smith reportedly claimed that the money he received was a personal loan from the former Bosasa Chief Operating Officer Angelo Agrizzi. Smith was recently elected as Chairperson of the Justice and Correctional Service Committee. He is also chairing the Standing Committee on the Auditor General and co-chairing the Joint Constitutional Review Committee. ANC Caucus Spokesperson Nonceba Mhlauli said ANC Chief Whip Jackson Mthembu will on Wednesday present Smith’s request to the ANC’s political committee. She says it will only be after that meeting when Mthembu and Smith will know whether he can step aside or if acting chairpersons must be elected pending the outcome of Ethics committee’s investigation. The Council for the Advance of the South African Constitution (CASAC) believes that Smith took the right decision to step aside. CASAC’s Lawson Naidoo earlier said the ANC should honour Smith’s request if he wants to clear his name and for the Ethics Committee process to be finalised. WATCH RELATED VIDEO:
