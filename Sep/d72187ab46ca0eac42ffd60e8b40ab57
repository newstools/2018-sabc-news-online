Police have been attacked by a group of unknown suspects at a taxi rank in Polokwane, resulting in a violent clash. This left two police officers injured and their vehicles damaged, while one of the suspects was shot in the leg. Limpopo police spokesperson Moatshe Ngoepe says police were searching for drugs when they were attacked. This is when a group of unknown people came and started to interfere in the police duties. During that process, three suspects were arrested. They will appear before the Polokwane Magistrates Court soon. The taxi rank is currently closed.
