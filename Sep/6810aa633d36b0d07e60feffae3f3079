Police have arrested a teacher at St Matthews High school at Keiskammahoek in the Eastern Cape for alleged sexual assault. Some teachers in the same school are allegedly implicated in the sex-for-marks scandal. On Wednesday, teaching and learning at the school came to a halt after learners protested on the premises, demanding the removal of five teachers, including the school principal. Five teachers have since been suspended by the Department of Education. However, Police Spokesperson, Captain Khaya Tonjeni says, “We can comfortably confirm that there is one isolated case that is opened against the teacher for  sexually violating a 17-year-old, but it is very important to categorically  state to the public that the matter at hand is not directly linked with the circumstances at a school that were recently reported. There is one teacher that has been arrested, but it doesn’t have any connection with the incident that was reported happening at the school.” Meanwhile, Director for Labour Relations at the Education Department, Sihle Mnguni says learners at the school will receive counseling. “We do have our unit that has got all the specialists in the form of psychologist, therapist, counsellors who will also be working very hard to ensure that learners’ welfare is taken care of. It’s very unfortunate that as this comes to … it came at a time when schools were closing, but we are 100% sure that come the opening of schools all those officials will be deployed to the school whereby we’ll make sure that the right thing is done to the learners,” says Mnguni.
