The African National Congress (ANC) says the only thing that the front-page report in Sunday’s Sunday Times newspaper proves, is that the safety of the party’s leaders is at risk. The report claims that former President Jacob Zuma held a clandestine meeting with top ANC officials including the party’s secretary-general Ace Magashule, former North West Premier Supra Mahumapelo and African National Congress Youth League (ANCYL) Secretary in KwaZulu-Natal, Thanduxolo Sabelo to discuss a plot to oust President Cyril Ramaphosa.   <a href="https://iono.fm/e/601463">Content hosted by iono.fm</a> Mabe wants Sunday Times to retract report ANC spokesperson Pule Mabe says they want the Sunday Times to retract the report. “There’s no plot. I sit in the collective of the National Executive Committee and I can tell you now [that] the secretary general of the ANC can meet with any member of the ANC in good standing that is not a crime. That’s why we issued a statement fully aware of the message that we are sending out to the public. “Actually one of the things that we have requested the Sunday Times to do is to retract that story. It’s mired with a lot of gossip. It has now come to our knowledge that leaders of the ANC are being followed it must worry us … that amounts to invasion of privacy. Why would the Sunday Times employ a journalist to follow the moves they are going to end up killing our leaders – we must be worried. It’s too worrying to know that a newsroom has invested money on an investigative journalist to follow the movements of our own leaders,” explains Mabe.
