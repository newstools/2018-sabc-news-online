Democratic Alliance (DA) leader Mmusi Maimane will launch his party’s 2019 national election campaign at the Mary Fitzgerald Square in Johannesburg on Saturday morning. He will be accompanied by his election team which will popularise the party’s campaign message across the country. The DA is preparing for the 2019 national elections and Gauteng is the launch pad for its campaign. The official opposition is focusing on several provinces including Gauteng and the Northern Cape and wants to retain the Western Cape with an increased majority. While in coalition governments with other parties in Johannesburg and Tshwane following the 2016 local elections, the party is not leaving anything to chance gasping for an overall win in Gauteng. Maimane will unveil their campaign strategy on Saturday anchored on a need for change to build one South Africa for all. He will also introduce the team that will lead their door-to-door campaign.
