Two men have been arrested following an incident where two men were shot dead at a taxi rank in Tembisa, north of Kempton Park on Gauteng’s East Rand earlier this year. Police say the suspects were arrested in Gauteng. It’s believed the shooting incident is related to taxi violence as one of the suspects is a Midrand Taxi Association patroller. Police spokesperson Kay Makhubele says the suspects will be charged with murder and attempted murder. Police made the breakthrough after an intensive investigation. They followed up on all information received which led them to the arrest of the two suspects. One of the suspects led the police to KwaZuluNatal where they also recovered firearms.
