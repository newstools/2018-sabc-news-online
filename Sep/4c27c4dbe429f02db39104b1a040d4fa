The SABC Board notes with concern the recent reported statements by African National Congress (ANC) Secretary General Ace Magashule over possible retrenchments at the public broadcaster. Earlier on Saturday, the ANC said it will not allow retrenchments to go ahead at the SABC. The SABC says the reported statement has caused some confusion among our employees and other stakeholders. SABC spokesperson Neo Momodu says, “In this context, the SABC believes it is necessary to confirm that the Board has the exclusive power in terms of section 13(11) of the Broadcasting Act, 1999 to “control the affairs of the Corporation”. This includes how the SABC operates the business of the public broadcaster and conducts labour relations with its employees.” Meanwhile, Magashule says the ANC would support the workers of the SABC. “We must support the workers of SABC. The ANC has taken a decision and I’m talking on behalf of the President that we must not allow any retrenchments even in our SOEs same with SABC – we should not allow people to be retrenched,” says Magashule. The SABC currently has R1.3 billion debt and an annual salary bill of R3,1 billion. The SABC Board has assured all its employees and stakeholders that it will continue to uphold its fiduciary duty to act in the best interests of the Corporation.
