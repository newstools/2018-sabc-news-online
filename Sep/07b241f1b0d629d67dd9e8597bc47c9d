Firefighter Wynand Engelbrecht says Johannesburg has almost the worst firefighting capacity in the country in relation to its needs. Speaking to the SABC, Englbrecht, who also runs a private firefighting operation and has written a book about firefighting, says although the City should have 104 fire engines, it has only seven for 35 stations. He says Johannesburg is only better than the beleaguered Emfuleni Municipality. “Sandton, Midrand, Randburg, Hunters Hill [and] Lone Hill haven’t had fire engines for the last 2 years. Every few months they push a ladder into Hunters Hill and the public believe they have a fire engine but they only have a truck with a ladder on. And so as far as that is concerned they are way behind. Emfuleni is the worst of them all, if you can be worse than Johannesburg, Emfuleni is,” explains Engelbrecht.
