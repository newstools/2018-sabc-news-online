Five Chinese nationals and a Mozambican are expected to appear in the Odendaalsrus Magistrates Court on Monday for illegally manufacturing liquor on a farm in the northern Free State. Their arrest came as a result of a joint operation by the Free State Liquor Board, the SAPS and various government departments. This followed a tip off from members of the community. Free State police spokesperson Stephen Thakeng says the suspects will face the full might of the law. “We arrested them and they will be facing the might of the law. Their charges are manufacturing liquor without registering. We can confirm that the sixth suspect is a Mozambican national who has been arrested.” Their charges are manufacturing liquor without registering. Department of Trade and Industry Inspector Kathu Mudau says the aim of the operation was to enforce compliance to liquor traders and distributors. ” We came to the scene and found a plant where vodka was manufactured illegally by Chinese nationals without documents. The litres of vodka found on the scene was about to be shipped was about 6000.”
