Police have confirmed that Midvaal mayor Bongani Baloyi has been arrested together with an African National Congress (ANC) community liaison officer. Baloyi and the ANC member became involved in a physical fight. Baloyi said he was hit in the face with a stone while the ANC member also claimed he was attacked by the mayor. A group of about 15 people attempted to prevent the mayor from addressing the community at the launch of Arbor Day at Savannah City. Baloyi says the scuffle escalated when he insisted on speaking. “Both of them have opened cases of assault. This happened at an event where the mayor was planting trees. The community members objected and he was hit with a brick.  They have both been arrested and taken to court to apply for bail,” says police spokesperson Lungelo Dlamini.
