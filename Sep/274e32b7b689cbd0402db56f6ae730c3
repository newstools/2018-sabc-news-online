President Cyril Ramaphosa says government is working to accelerate the process of digital migration. He was speaking after his announcement of an economic stimulus package to help the economy grow and create jobs. At the beginning of September, Ramaphosa urged the Department of Telecommunications to speed up its decision on the allocation of radio frequency spectrum for wireless networks. This after telecoms firms, such as Vodacom and MTN, warned that they’re running out of frequencies to deliver mobile broadband. Ramaphosa says mobile networks announcement will allow them to bring down data prices and provide better coverage to users. “Digital migration, we are working on. We want to speed that process up. The allocation of spectrum has taken quite a long time; there have been a number of court cases.” “But there has been a consultation process with a number of role players and I think we have arrived at a type of architecture that will work because industry has been consulted and there will be a good players for the key players to play but there will also be space for the new players.” “The licensing conditions are going to be issued. I know that ICASA is busy with it and the minister is going to clean up everything there so we can press the button and go ahead with this.” Click  video below:
