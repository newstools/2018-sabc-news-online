The African National Congress (ANC) Youth League has called on police to investigate the alleged involvement of  private security personnel in the Tshwane University Technology (TUT) violent protests. Soshanguve ANC Youth League political commissar Bokamoso Sekgole says in the past security personnel at TUT campuses were blamed for violence. Sekgole says the recent violent protests at the two campuses was triggered by the shooting of Katlego Monareng, allegedly without provocation. “This violence is not only started by students. Even this security companies; they come here burn down the building so that they can continue making profit from TUT by getting business. It’s not the first time they have done this. We are aware that our students are not hooligans and they will never burn down buildings. At some point, we get provoked by these bouncers. You see, they are very big and they are here in TUT to make sure that they milk our institution dry and they make money masquerading as if they are here to protect our students,” says Sekgole.
