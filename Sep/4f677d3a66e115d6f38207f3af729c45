There is still uncertainty over when Tiger Brands plans to re-open its Enterprise Plant in Polokwane, Limpopo. The plant has been disinfected from listeriosis which Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi has announced to be officially over in South Africa. The company had earlier hinted that the factory would be reopened in September. Meanwhile, some people have expressed excitement over the end of the outbreak. “I am happy, I am happy that we can start consuming polonies and viennas again, for you to have a decent meal you must have viennas and polonies, it was very problematic,” says an excited person. “We are happy that the listeriosis thing is over now,” says another excited person. “We are very happy because with these russians and polonies, we are going to be successful,” adds another person.
