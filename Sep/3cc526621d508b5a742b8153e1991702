A memorial service for the four children who burnt to death while their mothers were allegedly out partying will be held in Alexandra, north of Johannesburg on Wednesday. A 14-year-old child was also at home but survived after escaping the blaze and calling for help. The women, who are facing charges of neglect and culpable homicide, appeared briefly in the Alexandra Magistrate’s Court on Tuesday. They were remanded in custody until their formal bail application is heard next week.  The mothers will need to lodge a special application to attend the children’s funeral which is set to take place on Saturday. Speaking outside the court, Gauteng MEC for Social Development, Nandi Mayathula-Khoza, says the Department will support the family. She says: “We will support in particular the 14 year old child who managed to escape on that Sunday morning in terms of schooling because the uniform has been burnt so we will be providing school uniform and we will be helping the family with food. We will also be helping the family with counselling. As you can see they are distraught, they are sad and we will assist them with psychosocial support.”
