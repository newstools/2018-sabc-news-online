Police at Phoenix, north of Durban, have warned the public not to jump to conclusions that the decomposed body of a child found dumped in a bush is that of Miguel Louw. The nine year-old went missing in July. A 43-year-old man, Mohamed Ibrahim has been arrested for the alleged kidnapping of Louw and granted R2 500 bail. This is the second time that the decomposing remains of a child linked to a high profile case has been found dumped in Phoenix. The first major incident occurred in 2015 where nine-year-old Shahiel Sewpujan was discovered dumped in a sewer. SAPS spokesperson Thembeka Mbhele says police will release a statement once the body has been positively identified.
