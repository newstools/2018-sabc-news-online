Inclement weather across  Eastern Cape has caused havoc in some parts, but the welcome rain also brought relief to many drought-stricken areas. The Lootsberg pass and the Wapadsberg pass in the Graaff Reinet area have been closed due to excessive snow. Localised flooding also affected more than 400 people in the Nelson Mandela Bay Metro, but the heavy rain in the Langkloof, where some areas recorded more than 200 millimetres is great news for the dams supplying the metro as this is the main catchment area. The snow has also brought pleasure to many residents and it’s a rare opportunity as it usually snows only in July. The cut-off low weather system realised heavy rain showers over the western half of the Eastern Cape. The towns of Joubertina and Kareedouw recorded more than 160 millimetres of rain. The inclement weather has already started clearing from the west. Weather SA predicts showers in the eastern half of the province on Sunday as the system continues to move and dissipate.
