Former GCIS CEO Mzwanele Manyi has revealed that he has formally written to the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture requesting for an opportunity to come forward and testify. Manyi was appointed into the position in February 2011 after the sudden removal of Themba Maseko. He has since been named in current acting GCIS head Phumla Williams testimony. Manyi says he has written to the commission in order to table his version of events. He says: “I want to exercise my right of response and just table my version of what I did when I first set my foot at GCIS on the 3rd of February 2011.” Williams, in her testimony, told the commission that Manyi changed a number of things as soon as he assumed the position such as the composition of the bid adjudication committee as well as ensuring the body’s audit and media buying functions reported directly to him. Manyi says he would like to be given an opportunity to explain why he did it. The commission is expected to resume on Thursday where Deputy Chief Justice Zondo will hear applications for leave to cross examine witnesses by implicated persons.
