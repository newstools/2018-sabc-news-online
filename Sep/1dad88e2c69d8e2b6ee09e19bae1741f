Social Security Agency (Sassa) says it will not be asking for any other extensions, and has assured social grant recipients that it’s ready to pay them their October grant money. Sassa says payments will be made together with the South African Post Office. The social grant agency says Cash Paymaster Services (CPS) whose grant payment contract ends at the end of this month, is now only responsible for paying less than 10% of beneficiaries this month. Sassa spokesperson Paseka Letsatsi says, “As an organisation we have reached 90% in terms of payment of cash beneficiaries. As an organisation we are actually happy that we are in line in terms of implementing the Constitutional Court directive.” “We just want to assure our beneficiaries that they will definitely get their grant in full come month end.” adds Letsatsi.
