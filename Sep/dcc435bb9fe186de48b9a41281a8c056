Fire investigators and engineers will begin a probe on Monday into the cause of the deadly fire that ravaged the Bank of Lisbon building in central Johannesburg last week, claiming the lives of three firefighters. Fire safety officials entered the gutted building over the weekend for preliminary checks. The building was earlier found to be non-compliant with safety regulations. Johannesburg Emergency Services spokesperson Nana Radebe says, “Today the City of Johannesburg, the fire safety unit will be at the Lisbon Building to start with the preliminary investigations of what caused the fire and what caused the fire to spread to other floors.”
