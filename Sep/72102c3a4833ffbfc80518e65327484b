There were emotional scenes at the funeral in Phoenix, west of Durban, of three family members killed last week allegedly by a person known to them. The bodies of Janelle Govindsamy and her daughters, Rackelle and Dennisha were found in their flat. A 45-year-old man was arrested and charged with their murder. Thousands of mourners bid the slain Govindsamy family a tearful farewell. Their killing sparked outrage and shock in the Phoenix community.  Just a few weeks ago, the body of nine-year-old Miguel Louw was found in the same area. Community members say crime is rife there and have called on law enforcement authorities to intervene. Annie Ganasparsadh, sister of the deceased, says that their family is devastated. “My sister was a very humble, loving person who gave priority to her family. During her short stay in this world, she touched many hearts in the community. The loss of this beautiful soul will have a great void in the hearts of our family, friends and relatives. The loss of Jane and her girls has left the entire family devastated and shocked due to the circumstances surrounding their tragic deaths.” The suspect is expected to appear in court on Wednesday and the state has indicated that it will oppose bail.
