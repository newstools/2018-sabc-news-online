Residents and business owners in Matatiele in the Eastern Cape have embarked on a protest, barricading all municipal offices in the area. The protest follows numerous complaints about shoddy workmanship by a company that is working on roads in the area. Last week Roads and Transport MEC Weziwe Tikana met with the residents, however, residents are calling on President Cyril Ramaphosa to intervene. They say they have been complaining about the poor condition of three roads which has led to four crashes. Community leader Teboho Stemere says they have lost confidence in the municipality. Stemere says, “We all agreed white or black, we are residents of Matatiele we are one, so we all agreed that instead of shutting the town down we will just be actually hurting ourselves. So the problem is governance. So we decided that we will wake up every day and we will close those offices until this problem is solved, until they deliver.”
