Four children between the ages of three and six died after their home caught fire in Alexandra north of Johannesburg in early hours of Sunday morning. The eldest, who was aged six, died in the fire while the other three died later in hospital. Police say the siblings were asleep when their blanket caught fire, a 14 year old child managed to escape and call for help. Police spokesperson Stephen Malatji says the mothers of the children left them alone when they went on a drinking spree. Malatji says, “Their mothers, at the time of the tragedy were not around. We are being told they usually leave them alone and go on a drinking spree. One of the mothers was found in a shebeen, she was taken in and now she’s behind bars at Alexandra police station.” “We are still looking for a second one,” adds Malatji.
