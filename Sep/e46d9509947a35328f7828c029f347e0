Police are still investigating the killing of three people in a shooting in Soweto over the weekend. Five others were left critically injured when three gunmen stormed a house in Dobsonville, and opened fire. The motive for the attack is still unknown. Many in the Dobsonville street are simply too scared to share the trauma they endured. Two people died on the scene and one young boy succumbed to his injures and died in hospital. Apart from one person, all were members of the same family. Police have not made any arrests: “We are still investigating the motive we don’t know why the suspects shot the people. We are still following leads to establishing who the suspects are. We appeal to anyone who know the suspects and anyone with information can call crime stop on 0860010111,” says Gauteng Police spokesperson, Colonel Lungelo Dlamini.
