Dozens of people have been injured after two Metrorail trains collided in Selby, south of Johannesburg. Metrorail spokesperson Lillian Mofokeng says the trains were on the same track coming from opposite directions when they collided. Mofokeng says commuters sustained minor to moderate injuries and while they’re receiving medical attention buses have been provided as alternative transport for commuters. She says: “We are trying to attend to others it looks like the number of the injured people will increase but for now that is the information we can share.” ER24 spokesperson Russel Meiring says they treated about 100 people for minor injuries. He says: “ER 24 paramedics along with numerous services were on the scene to find both trains upright on the tracks. Numerous people had already climbed off the train and were found walking around at the scene. Emergency services began to assess the patients, approximately 100 were assessed for minor to moderate injuries, fortunately no fatalities were found.”
