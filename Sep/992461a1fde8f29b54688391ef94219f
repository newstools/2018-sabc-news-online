President Cyril Ramaphosa says women, youth and small business are three crucial pillars that must drive technological advances. Ramaphosa was speaking at the annual International Telecom Union (ITU) Conference, currently  underway in Durban. The three-day conference brings together global leaders in technology and entrepreneurship with the theme, “Innovation for a smarter World”. This is a gathering of global digital experts and business to showcase their innovative new technology tools and gadgets but also to explore new investment opportunities. Like most countries, South Africa has made great strides in technology over the years with an estimated 87% of households with access to phones. But despite this, about 20 million people in the country cannot access the internet. High data costs and accessibility remain a challenge. Thus the government has prioritised the rapid expansion of broadband. President Cyril Ramaphosa says: “We have finalised consultations with the telecommunications industry and other stakeholders to ensure allocation of spectrum reduces barriers to entry, promotes competition and reduces costs to consumers.” The President also stressed the role women and youth must play in this digital revolution. “Women and youth must be at the heart of the technology they are the pillars that must drive technological advances.” Growing investment opportunities in the sector could bring about increased trade and job creation.
