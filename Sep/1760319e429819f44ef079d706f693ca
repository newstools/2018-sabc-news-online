After much anticipation, the Democratic Alliance has announced its Premiership candidate for the Western Cape. The announcement was delayed twice after the DA leader, Mmusi Maimane was requested to stand for the position. Maimane has since declined. The nominated candidate for Premiership of the Western Cape is Alan Winde. Winde could take over from the current Premier Helen Zille after next year’s general elections. He says he is ready to take over the reins. “I think it is a huge opportunity and it is something that I will put my full weight behind. It is not about ruling. It is about putting a team together. In the past, as government, I think in the last ten years, we have really shown that we have built the foundation. We have built the governance. We have then taken this province to different levels.” Winde is currently the provincial minister of economic opportunities. Maimane says Winde will face tough competition from several political parties. “The candidate will have tough competition because after 2019, we are working to get two more premiers. So, the competition is going to be stiff. Gone are the days when they just compete with the ANC. I think it is clear that they have won that battle. These are competitions in the DA that we pride ourselves in doing the best for the people, and who can deliver the best for them.” Maimane has also has confirmed Dan Plato as Cape Town Mayor elect. He will replace Patricia De Lille at the end of October. Maimane described Plato as an ‘activist’. Watch for more:
