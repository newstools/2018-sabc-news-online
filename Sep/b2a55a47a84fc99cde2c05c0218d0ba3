The African National Congress (ANC) secretary general Ace Magashule says reports that he and other ANC officials met in an effort to unseat President Cyril Ramaphosa are mischievous. The Sunday Times reported over the weekend that Magashule met with former President Jacob Zuma, African National Congress Women’s League (ANCWL) secretary general Meokgo Matuba and KwaZulu-Natal ANC Youth League Secretary Thanduxolo Sabelo at a Durban hotel last Thursday to discuss the plot. Magashule says he is unaware of a meeting that was held to remove President Ramaphosa from office. “How do you believe a story that says we were plotting [to oust] President Cyril Ramaphosa, in a meeting we are not part of – just imagine … it’s really mischievous. How do you believe [that story] I still don’t understand. how [does] an ordinary person believe that meeting [former] president Jacob Zuma is plotting because it’s not the last time I’ll meet President Zuma,” explains Magashule.
