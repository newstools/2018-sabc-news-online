President Cyril Ramaphosa has told the United Nations General Assembly in New York that South Africa is making progress in addressing key issues in the country, including the land question and weak economic growth. President Ramaphosa has praised the UN for continuing to offer hope to South Africans during the dark days of Apartheid. He says the country is continuing to move forward in addressing the legacy of oppression and discrimination. President Ramaphosa and many other global leaders emphasised the need for global co-operation. This is in stark contrast to the speech of US President Donald Trump who emphasised patriotism and downplayed the role of globalism. President Trump also took a swipe at oil producing countries for the high oil price â€“ which is stoking high fuel prices in many parts of the world. Click video below:
