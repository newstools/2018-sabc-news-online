Weapons manufacturer, Rheinmetall Denel Munitions in Somerset West says the company had hoped that the results of the South African Police Service forensic investigations into last week’s explosion would be ready by Tuesday. However, it seems more likely that this process will be concluded at the end of the week. Eight people died during the explosion at the plant. Company management will on Wedneday host a lunch for the families affected by last week’s incident. In a statement, they say this forms part of a series of engagements with the families, staff and the greater community as part of the healing process. Rheinmetall Denel Munition CEO, Norbert Schulze, says their priority remains the families and they are providing whatever assistance they can, including ongoing counselling. Pathologists say post-mortem results of the eight victims will be made available on Wednesday. Related Video
