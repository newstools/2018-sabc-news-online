The funeral of the student killed in recent unrest at the Tshwane University of Technology, Katlego Monareng is under way in Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga. Monareng, who was a third year LLB student, died a week ago after police allegedly fired live ammunition at students during a violent protest. This was over alleged vote-rigging at SRC elections. A police officer allegedly fired an R5 rifle into the ground. Monareng succumbed to his wound en-route to hospital. Police watchdog Ipid is investigating the case. Related video
