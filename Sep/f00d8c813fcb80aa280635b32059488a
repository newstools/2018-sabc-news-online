The Commission of Inquiry into State Capture will reconvene shortly but itâ€™s not yet clear which witnesses will testify. Democratic Alliance (DA) leader Mmusi Maimane is leading a picket outside the venue of the commission in Parktown, Johannesburg. Maimane wants several senior members of the ANC who have been implicated in state capture so far, to appear before the inquiry which Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo is chairing. The DA has already written to the secretary of the commission requesting that 12 African National Congress (ANC) witnesses appear before the commission and explain their alleged role in state capture.
