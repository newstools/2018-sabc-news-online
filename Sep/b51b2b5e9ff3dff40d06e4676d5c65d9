Acting GCIS Head, Phumla Williams, has told the State Capture Inquiry the way former Communications minister Faith Muthambi treated her brought back memories of the effects of the torture she suffered as an ANC activist under the apartheid government. Williams was the fifth witness to testify before the commission sitting in Parktown, Johannesburg. Williams has been acting in and out of the position of government spokesperson, for the past six-years since Mzwanele Manyi left as GCIS Director-General. Williams accused Muthambi of a reign of imposing terror and destroying Government Communications between 2014 and 2017. “I think Minister Muthambi or rather this woman she had ripped my scars of torture completely. I think when I was writing this letter the effects of my torture were back.” “I was no longer sleeping, I had nightmares, my facial twitches were back I had panic attacks and I saw torture going through my body again.” The Commission of Inquiry into State Capture has adjourned until Thursday.
