Traffic authorities have advised motorists in Gauteng, Limpopo, the North West and Mpumalanga to proceed with extreme caution on Friday, as large parts of the provinces are enveloped in thick mist. The South African Weather Service says the fog should lift during the course of the day. Meanwhile, parts of the North West, the Free State and KwaZulu-Natal might experience rain and thunderstorms which could also affect visibility on roads. The City of Joburg’s emergency services spokesperson Robert Mulaudzi says motorists should switch on their headlights. “It is misty and cloudy in most parts of the city of Johannesburg this morning. Motorists are urged to exercise extreme caution while driving. Keep a safe following distance and of course arrive alive.”
