International and national policy experts and role players on public broadcasting are meeting in Midrand, north of Johannesburg, on Thursday and Friday to review the South African Public Broadcasting Policy. The dialogue themed: ‘Building a resilient public broadcaster’ will be hosted by the Department of Communications led by Minister Nomvula Mokonyane and Deputy Minister Pinky Kekana. It will shed light on challenges and cutting-edge demands such as the 4th Industrial Revolution, collaborative opportunities and strategies to reshape the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) of the future. The mandate of the SABC and alleged political interference have been at the heart of challenges faced by the public broadcaster. Written submissions that were received on the review of the Public Broadcasting Service which ended in August, the SABC Editorial Policy and the outcomes of the two day dialogue will form part of the finalisation of the Public Broadcasting Policy Review. The dialogue will review the SABC’s mandate to ensure that it responds to global trends towards online and on-demand services and government calls on the public and broadcasting industry stakeholders to help create a new vision for public broadcasting.
