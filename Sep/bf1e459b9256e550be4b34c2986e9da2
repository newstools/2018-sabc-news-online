Home Affairs minister, Malusi Gigaba, is expected to appear before Parliament’s inquiry into the naturalisation of the Gupta family on Thursday. On Wednesday the Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (OUTA) told Parliament’s Home Affairs Committee that e-mail evidence shows that Malusi Gigaba had a close relationship with the Gupta Family. The committee is busy with its second phase of the inquiry. On Wednesday, officials from the North West Education and Sports development department testified before the committee. MEC Sello Lehari told MPs that 33 schools benefited from donations that were given by Gupta owned company Oakbay Investments. Gupta owned companies allegedly used their involvement in the schools as a social responsibility programme to justify why their citizenship should be naturalised. The committee has concluded the initial phase but has identified gaps that it says will be filled through another set of public hearings, to be conducted over three days. Watch video below:
