Trade union Solidarity says its members at the petrochemicals firm Sasol will embark on a three-week strike starting on Thursday. This after they went on a go-slow protest on Monday over a share scheme that the firm has exclusively offered to black staff. South African companies are required to meet quotas on black ownership, employment and procurement as part of a drive to reverse decades of exclusion under apartheid. Meeting the rules makes a company more likely to qualify for government tenders. Solidarity has been waging a challenge against racial quotas in the workplace. It lodged a complaint against the policy with the UN Human Rights Commission in 2016. Economist Yashodan Naidoo says Solidarity is being unreasonable. Naidoo says Solidarity is a union which has shown its colours many times regarding which side of the fence it sits on, so itâ€™s no surprise that they would go on strike.
