Police Minister Bheki Cele is addressing the community of Phoenix north of Durban, where the bodies of three women: a mother and her two daughters, were discovered in their home on Friday night. Cele has called on the community to look out for each other and to care about the well being of the community. He has questioned why no-one heard any sounds coming from the flat that is located within a small, tightly-knit complex. A 45 year old suspect has been arrested in connection with the murders and is expected to appear in court on Tuesday.
