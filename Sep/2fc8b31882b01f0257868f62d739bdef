Nine solar-powered vehicles are crisscrossing South Africa in what’s been described as the ultimate test of technology. The 5000-km Sasol Solar Challenge race started in Pretoria. The cars and crew made an overnight stop in Bloemfontein. They’re heading south to Stellenbosch in the Western Cape where the race will end on Sunday. Local and international teams from various schools and institutions of higher learning are participating and they look like something out of a science fiction movie. There are no pitstops to refuel since the cars are powered by the sun. The race is not about speed but about how much distance each vehicle can cover. Breakdowns have resulted in some vehicles being towed along the route. Team members – engineering students and avid science learners – are doing repairs. “You saw some teams struggling right from the start because they hadn’t stored enough energy in their battery. And then, we got to Kroonstad – very exciting arrival. And then by few minutes later a storm started and teams had their tents being blown away and some of their solar cars got wet. So, a lot of maintenance had to be done,” said Sasol Challenge Spokesperson, Ashanti Mogosetsi. But the participating teams are not deterred. “I do the navigation. I check the uphills and downhills. And then every morning very early I check what the weather patterns are predicted to be. Just to make sure that we are travelling not against the wind, against the wind we get a lot of drag that way,” said Martin Vosloo, a Grade 8 learner from Pretoria. The race will make its way past 18 towns in eight days.
