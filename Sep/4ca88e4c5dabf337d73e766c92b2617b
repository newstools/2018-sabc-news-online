Limpopo’s Health MEC Phophi Ramathuba says they are ready to deal with a possible outbreak of cholera and typhoid in the north of the country. Ramathuba has visited the Beit Bridge border between South Africa and Zimbabwe, following a cholera and typhoid outbreak in that country. It has affected 2 000 people and claimed 25 lives. There’ve been no reported cases in Limpopo so far. Ramathuba says they want to prevent what happened in 2008 when a similar outbreak spilled over the border and killed several people in South Africa. She says because we are on the border, we need to make sure that all our systems are in place. “We have made sure all our clinics and our hospitals are alert. Any diarrhoea case must be thoroughly investigated,” says Ramathuba.
