Police have expressed serious concern at the recent increase of video clips on social media showing alleged cases of child kidnappings and abductions. They say up to now, there has been no evidence to suggest that the depicted incidents happened in South Africa or are legitimate and have dismissed the videos as a hoax. National Police spokesperson Brenda Muridili says, “We have been doing some investigations, contacting our police stations to see if there’s been any reports that relate to such incidents that we see on social media. But at this stage we have not yet had one incident reported to the police.”
