No South Africans have been involved in the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia. South Africa has sent its condolences to the Southeast Asian nation following a powerful earthquake and tsunami that has claimed the lives of at least 384 people.   Hospitals are battling to cope with the influx of patients. The Department of International Relations and Cooperation says any South African struggling to get hold of their relatives in Indonesia, can contact them. Department spokesperson Ndivhuwo Mabaya confirmed this. “We can confirm that there are no reports of any South African who has been injured or not traced in that area, but most importantly we want to say to the people of Indonesia, we’re with them in this difficult time. And our mission will assist if there’s any need to assist.”
