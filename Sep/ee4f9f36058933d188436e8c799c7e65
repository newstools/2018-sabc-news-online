The Democratic Alliance (DA) has formally lodged a complaint with Parliament’s Ethics Committee against the co-chairperson of the Constitutional Review Committee, Vincent Smith. The complaint emanates from reports that Smith received R 670 000 as well as security upgrades to his home from facilities management company Bosasa. The company has contracts with several government departments worth over R10 billion. DA Chief Whip John Steenhuisen says senior political figures and Chairpersons of Parliamentary committees should be above reproach. He says it appears as if Smith did not declare the detail and extent of his dealings with Bosasa to the Register of Members’ Interests. “The conflict of interest aspect is far more concerning, because you can’t have a situation where committee chairpersons are beholden to special private interests outside of parliament. It’s not right in terms of our process at parliament and it erodes trust in the institution,” says Steenhuisen. The ANC Chief Whip’s office has not yet reacted. WATCH RELATED VIDEO:
