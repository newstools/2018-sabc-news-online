African National Congress (ANC) President Cyril Ramaphosa says Public Enterprises Minister, Pravin Gordhan, has a big task in sorting out and dealing with the issues in his portfolio. Ramaphosa is in KwaZulu-Natal to engage business leaders as the ANC embarks on a process to draft its election manifesto. On Saturday afternoon he addressed the community of Chatsworth, south of Durban, as part of the Thuma Mina Campaign. Ramaphosa says in order for the economy to bounce back, South Africa needs strong and corruption-free state-owned enterprises. “We have a technical recession with our brows having dipped. We have to revamp our state-owned enterprises. Comrade Pravin Gordhan has his job cut out. What he inherited is one of the biggest messes that you can ever imagine – but we are grateful that he’s put his shoulder to the wheel and he’s going through every state-owned enterprise, cleaning it up, making sure that we have good state-owned enterprises.” Click video below:
