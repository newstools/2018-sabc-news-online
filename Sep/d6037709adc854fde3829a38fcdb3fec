Former President Jacob Zuma’s son, Duduzane Zuma, has availed himself to appear before the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture and testify. He previously declined to give testimony, saying he is facing parallel criminal charges. Zuma has also applied to cross-examine some witnesses, who have implicated him in their evidence before the commission. He has been implicated in the testimonies of former Deputy Finance minister Mcebisi Jonas, and former ANC MP, Vytjie Mentor. Proceedings have since been adjourned to Wednesday. Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo says this latest development changes Zuma’s application for leave to cross-examine. Watch video below:
