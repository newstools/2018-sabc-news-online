A council meeting in Nelson Mandela Bay has again descended into chaos following the presence of two Democratic Alliance (DA) Nelson Mandela Bay councillors who claim to hold the same post. Mbulelo Manyathi,  whose membership according to the party has been terminated, and his replacement  Lutho Sokudela both turned up claiming to represent the DA. Last week, the Port Elizabeth High court ruled that the termination of Manyathi’s membership was not procedural. Chaotic scenes played out when DA councillors shielded Sokudela when security personnel tried to remove him from the council chamber.  Speaker Buyelwa Mafaya says Manyathi is still a councillor: “The court judgement stated very clearly that councillor Manyathi is a councilor, he was a councillor even on August 27, he is still a councillor even if he resigns until all the avenues from the DA are attended to. In this case, even today we haven’t received anything that says otherwise. We only have the judgement that says Councillor Manyathi is still a councillor of the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality.”
