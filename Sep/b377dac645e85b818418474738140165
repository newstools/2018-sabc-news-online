African National Congress (ANC) Elections head Fikile Mbalula says the North West members will now have access to the ANC following the disbandment of the PEC. Mbalula was speaking in Polokwane, addressing the elections manifesto stakeholder’s forum. The ANC in Limpopo is gearing up for the coming general elections. A consultative process has been organised before the drafting of the new manifesto but the recent developments in North West remains topical. Mbalula says the decision to disband the PEC is in the best interest of ordinary members. “It is not about an individual but the decision to make sure that the organisation is united and accessible by all.” Mbalula says the consultations will ensure that the needs of ordinary people are incorporated in the manifesto. Consultations will be done in all the provinces before adoption of the 2019 Manifesto. WATCH RELATED VIDEO BELOW:
