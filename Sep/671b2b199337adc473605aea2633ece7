The head of the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (IPID), Robert McBride, says they are compiling a submission for the Zondo Commission into state capture. He appeared before Parliament’s Police committee to discuss the organisation’s quarterly report. McBride says the directorate’s work was frustrated due to state capture. And they have evidence they want to hand over to the commission. McBride says, “Victimisation, false charges and prosecutions and persecutions on false charges against state agents like ourselves, we will look at DPCI and SAPS. We don’t have a mandate to investigate, to deal with. The National Prosecuting Authority played a significant role in hollowing out anti-corruption units, including IPID.” He also lamented the state of the building in which they work. He appealed to Members of Parliament to intervene. “The building is a death trap. It is not habitable; obviously the deadly fire in Joburg has brought everything to the fore. Really we need some high level intervention, we’ve been crying all over the show,” says McBride. IPID’s Chief Director of Investigations and Information Management, Matthews Sesoko, has informed the committee that they are still working on several high profile cases. Among others, they are making progress in their investigation into the death of a Tshwane University of Technology student, allegedly at the hands of police.
