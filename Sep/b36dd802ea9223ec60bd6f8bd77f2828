The African National Congress (ANC) in KwaZulu-Natal has expressed shock at the arrest of their own councillor of the Msunduzi Municipality in the midlands in connection with the killing of the party activist Musawenkosi “Maqatha” Mchunu. Six suspects briefly appeared in the Pietermaritzburg Magistrates Court for allegedly killing Mchunu. Amongst the six suspects is an ANC councillor along with his two bodyguards. Mchunu was ambushed exiting his car at his home in KwaPata in Pietermaritzburg in May this year. ANC KwaZulu-Natal spokesperson Nomagugu Simelane-Zulu says, “And on follow up we realized that it was the councillor of ward 10 and it’s in relation to the death of Councillor Maqatha Mchunu. We’re very shocked that one of our own is implicated in such a drastic and terrible case. Of course we understand that everyone is innocent until proven guilty but the fact that one of us is associated with such an act is quite horrifying for the ANC.” Click below for related videos….
