The Hawks says they will not pity anyone implicated during the State Capture Commission of Inquiry. This follows the suspension of the head of the Hawks Anti-Corruption task team, Major-General Zinhle Mnonopi. She was accused of having tried to influence former deputy finance minister, Mcebisi Jonas, to quash a case involving Ajay Gupta, during the height of state capture. The State Capture Commission has gripped the nation for the past week. Led by Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo, the commission wants to get to the bottom of state capture, which almost collapsed the South African government. Jonas revealed the capture of the crime investigating unit by the Gupta family. He told the commission, Hawks Investigator General Mnonopi wanted him to kill the case involving Ajay Gupta. Ajay was accused of having tried to bribe Jonas with R600 million and a ministerial post. The controversial General Mnonopi now appears to be the first victim of the Commission. Hawks Spokesperson Hangwani Mulaudzi says:”We can confirm that a decision was taken on Thursday that Mnonopi has to be suspended. She was given 48 hours to respond to the allegations that were made by Jonas two weeks ago.” The Hawks will not hesitate to act against any more of its members implicated during the Commission. The Commission is expected to uncover more damning revelations, as it continues on Monday. Click video below:
