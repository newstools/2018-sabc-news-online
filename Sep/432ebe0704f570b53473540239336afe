Zambia has denied Kenyan Professor Patrick Lumumba entry into the country for security reasons. Professor Lumumba –  who delivered one of the Mandela Centenary Lectures in the Eastern Cape in July – was sent back by Zambia Immigration officials shortly after he landed at Kenneth Kaunda International Airport in Lusaka on Saturday. Zambian government spokesperson Dora Siliya cited security considerations. Lumumba who is outspoken about China-Africa relations was due to deliver a public lecture in Zambia titled “Africa in the age of China’s influence and global geo-dynamics.”
