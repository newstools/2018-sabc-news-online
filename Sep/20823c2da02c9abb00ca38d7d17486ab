Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi has warned that although the Listeriosis outbreak is over, South Africans should continue to take necessary precautions. Listeriosis has killed close to 200 people since March 2018. Motsoaledi says all the country’s 157 facilities that produce ready to eat foods have been inspected and have tested negative. “The incident rate of confirmed laboratory confirmed listeria cases has dropped to the pre-outbreak levels.” “Therefore the conclusion is that the outbreak of Listeteriosis in South Africa is over. And I am here to announce to you we no longer have a listeria outbreak in South Africa.” Related video click below: ;
