DA leader Mmusi Maimane has thrown his hat into the ring for the position of Premier of the Western Cape. Maimane was expected to announce the candidate for the position of premier on Sunday in Cape Town, but the media briefing has been postponed to Tuesday.  Other candidates include DA leader in the province, Bonginkosi Madikizela, DA MP David Maynier and the Provincial Minister for Economic Opportunities Alan Winde. Maimane’s spokesperson, Portia Adams says Maimane is discussing the candidacy with party structures. She says: “The DA Leader is discussing it and I think it’s important for you to understand the fact that he is still considering the matter and he is also in extensive discussions with the party structures as well.” “I think it’s important for me to outline and indicate that the leaders’ key consideration is what best for the party and for the residents of the Western Cape as well,” adds Adams.
