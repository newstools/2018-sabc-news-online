The South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) says it will cooperate with the Competition Commission in its investigation into the Public Broadcaster’s multi-million rand agreement with MultiChoice. The SABC was reacting to Friday’s judgment by the Constitutional Court that ruled that the Competition Commission is empowered to investigate whether the agreement brokered by the public broadcaster’s then Chief Operations Officer, Hlaudi Motsoeneng in 2013, is valid. In a unanimous judgment the court ruled that the Commission is also authorized to investigate whether the deal gave rise to a notifiable merger. A notifiable merger speaks to whether the deal could be implemented without the approval of the Competition Commission. The deal gave MultiChoice the right to air two of the SABC’s channels on its platform. Click below for a related story:
