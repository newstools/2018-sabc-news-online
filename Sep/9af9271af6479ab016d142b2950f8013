The City of Cape Town says it made careful consideration before applying for a R1.2 billion international loan. If approved at a full council meeting in October, the funds will be used to upgrade waste water plants. Questions have been raised about the timing of such an exorbitant loan as the country battles a technical recession. The Western Cape has also been in the grips of a drought. However dam levels have improved significantly in recent weeks. The loan is expected to be repaid over a 15-year-period. Further questions have been raised about why the city needs to borrow instead of digging into its own coffers. Officials say they previously relied on emergency loans to implement water augmentation projects during the severe drought. Economists have however questioned whether the move to borrow in the midst of a technical recession is financially sound. Economist Daniel Silke says the already cash-strapped residents are likely to end up footing the bill. “The city of Cape Town will have to be very mindful that incurring additional debt in the current economic framework under which we are all suffering, will not have any further detrimental effect on rates, taxes or additional levy increases. The citizens of Cape Town can only bear that much and I think Cape Town residents in particular are feeling the pinch in terms of their pockets.”
