The newly elected Economic Freedom Fighters  (EFF) chairperson in Free State, Mandisa Makhesini has vowed to restore unity in the party. The support was split between Makhesini and her predecessor, Kgotso Morapela. It was a tight race with 466 delegates – and Makhesini narrowly won with three more votes than Morapela. She says her election is a sign that patriarchy has been defeated. “The contestation was healthy, and we hope whoever wins will accommodate those who have lost. There’s no winner and there’s no looser. The EFF is the victor; we will work with everyone… there will be no purging. We will work with everyone to unite the EFF.” The rest of the top five include Deputy Chairpeson, Mahlomola Majake, Secretary, Malefane Msimanga, Deputy Secretary, Mapheola Dophoko, and Treasurer, Seipati Nanyane. The party is now gearing up for 2019 general election. Makhesini says: “We want to see EFF in every corner of the province. We want to grow the membership to increase the votes in this province, because in this province there is opportunity that we can be a majority.” The EFF also held elective conferences in Limpopo and the Northern Cape this weekend.
