Firefighters are still battling to extinguish a Johannesburg building fire. Onlookers in the city centre are still gathered near the building watching as firefighters take turns going in and out of the building to try extinguish the blaze. Three firefighters were killed on Wednesday. One of them fell to his death from the top floor. There are about 10 fire-engines lining the streets around the building with the roads in and around the Bank of Lisbon building cordoned off to traffic.  The building housed three Gauteng Government Departments and there have been concerns about its failure to adhere to safety regulations. By-standers are still trying to make sense of what they witnessing. “I am very shocked I didn’t know a building like this could be in fire unexpectedly … I’m surprised it’s still going on till this day.  I’m still puzzled … I’m still traumatised.” Click below for more….
