Police have fired teargas at one of the protest gatherings in Cape Town’s townships. The city of Cape Town has confirmed that the various gatherings in the city’s townships are illegal as organisers did not seek application as required by the law. Residents from areas of Manenberg, Bonteheuwel, Hanover Park, Langa, Gugulethu and Kesington gathered from five o’clock Tuesday morning to protest against rising poverty, crime and high unemployment levels. Protesters have vowed to shut down all major roads leading the city. The city’s Mayoral Committee Member for Safety, JP Smith has confirmed that teargas has been fired at Voortrekker Road … “The fact is the organisers did not apply in terms of the national legislation and this means that the road closures this morn are unlawful, so the protesters organised by Cosatu who is part of national government and therefore part of keeping the regulation of the national gatherings act, are being teargassed and shot at one location by Saps which is controlled by national government due to protest about poor state of policing which is competency of national government. So its really a very difficult situation for the city.”
