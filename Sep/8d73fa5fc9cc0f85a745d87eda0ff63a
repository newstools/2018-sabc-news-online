Acts of violence and intimidation are being reported in different parts of the Eastern Cape as the Santaco taxi shutdown continues. Police have been dispersing people blockading the roads with rubber bullets. The major urban areas of Port Elizabeth, East London; Uitenhage and King William’s Town are badly affected. Santaco is blaming a failed relationship between them and the provincial transport department for the protest. The taxi council wants increased scholar subsidies, among other demands. Santaco provincial Secretary Vusumzi Mbewu says they’ve run out of patience with MEC Oscar Mabuyane and others provincial officials. “We had to go plead with Mr Mabuyane because our pleas fell on deaf ears at the department of transport. So I cannot say they are willing or unwilling to listen to us because we had to take further steps and go to Mr Mabuyane and plead for his assistance”.
