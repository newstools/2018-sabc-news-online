Gun Free South Africa says poor gun control contributes to the high murder rate in the country. The murder rate has been on an upward trajectory since 2012. According to the 2017/18 Crime statistics murder increased by 6.9% compared to the previous year.  Gun Free SA says this shows that guns are overwhelmingly the weapon of choice to kill, injure, and intimidate. The organisation says fraud and corruption has resulted in a steady increase in the availability of guns in society. Gun Free SA Director, Adèle Kirsten has appealed to the police ministry to restrict access to firearms. “Guns drive the murders largely. When the is an increase of gun availability, when there is poor control over guns and when there is a high level of circulation of illegal guns one see an increase in murder. One of the things Gun Free SA will be calling for, is to strengthen our national control law, the firearms control act”.
