The City of Tshwane says it shut down the Correctional Services national offices in Pretoria to avoid a situation similar to last week’s, where three fire fighters lost their lives fighting a fire at a non-complaint Department of Health building in Johannesburg. Tshwane mayor Solly Msimanga shut down the 32 storey Poyntons building occupied by 1 500 people after it was found to have failed to comply with health and safety standards. The city says this exercise is part of their routine rejuvenation project. Msimanga’s spokesperson, Samkelo Mgobhozi says, “In light of recent development, and the safety of all residents of Tshwane, we elected to close the building down and to revisit it at a later stage to further asses the structural integrity and the apparatus to be adequate. We want to avoid a similar situation as to what happened in Johannesburg.”
