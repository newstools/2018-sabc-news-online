Telecommunications and Postal Services Minister Siyabonga Cwele says South Africa must ensure it’s not left behind in the fast growing ICT industry. He says the sector has a huge potential of being one of the main drivers of the economy. Cwele was addressing the 4th BRICS Ministers’ Summit held in Durban. Cwele says the high cost of data in South Africa is a hurdle that continues to be on the agenda. He believes the country needs more innovators in the ICT sector for inclusive economic growth. The meeting of BRICS ministers has brought together multinational companies in the ICT sector expected to come up with new ways of further co-operation. Siyabonga Cwele says: “As BRICS countries we are looking at other innovations which will really bring the costs down, we are looking to the infrastructure in our country. It is these innovations and new technologies which we are coming up with that will drive the costs down.” The meeting ends on Saturday. Related video click below:
