The African National Congress (ANC) says government should engage the Democratic Republic of Congo government and Southern African Development Community (SADC) as it is concerned that the situation in that country might descend into chaos, instability and violence. Six opposition parties from the Democratic Republic of Congo told the ANC they want the country to continue playing a part in restoring peace and stability in that country. The parties met the ANC delegation led by the Secretary General Ace Magashule in Johannesburg. They gave the ANC a detailed brief on the political situation in the DRC in the build up to the forthcoming general elections. President Cyril Ramaphosa has appointed former President Thabo Mbeki as his advisor on the Great Lakes region that includes the DRC, but last month DRC President Joseph Kabila said the country does not need any outside intervention. However, opposition parties are painting a different picture, saying the ANC is an important player given the history of its involvement in dispute resolution in the region. The ANC expressed concern about the current prevailing situation in the DRC, which if not urgently arrested, may lead to chaos, instability and violence.
