A taxi boss has been shot and killed in Tongaat, north of Durban. Police in KwaZulu-Natal says the 52-year-old man was declared dead at the scene after unknown men ambushed him outside a restaurant on Monday night in Tongaat town. KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson Thembeka Mbhele says at this stage the motive for the attack is unknown.  But Mbele says, however, they cannot rule out taxi violence as the victim held a position at a local taxi association. <a href="https://iono.fm/e/601907">Content hosted by iono.fm</a>
