The Nelson Mandela Foundation is set to release archive audio material from the Rivonia trial on Wednesday evening. The audio archive extracts which have been compiled with help from the National Audio Visual Institute in France, will share voices which include that of Madiba, Ahmed Kathrada, Walter Sisulu and other struggle stalwarts. Various scenarios are expected to be brought to life, such as Mandela’s famous : “I Am Prepared to Die” three-hour speech which he gave from the dock during the trial in 1964. More new sound bites are also expected to be heard, which will take listeners back giving insight to how the defence planned for the trial. “We selected extracts from Kathrada or from Sisulu, who are people we didn’t really know in Europe.  and so we tried to show that their commitment and their courage in their testimonies was really a highlight of the trial. we all know of course the famous speech from the doc, but there are other statements during the trial that are really outstanding showing their commitment to the cause that’s why we selected some clips and also selected some clips regarding technical issues,” said Brice Amouroux  from the National Audio Visual Institute in France.
