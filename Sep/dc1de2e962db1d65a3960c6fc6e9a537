Police have arrested a suspect following the shooting and killing of a Johannesburg Metro Police officer in Hillbrow, Johannesburg a short while ago. The officer was off-duty when he was attacked. JMPD spokesperson Wayne Minnaar says his firearm was also stolen. “One suspect has been arrested. He was found in a basement of a building. We are following up on information for a second suspect. The firearm has not yet been recovered. We are following up on information also to try and get the firearm.” In North West, a 17-year-old learner at Ramotshere Secondary School in Dinokana in the North West, has been arrested after stabbing a 24-year-old male teacher with a knife. The teacher was certified dead on arrival at Dinokana Health Centre, just after 11am. The teacher was allegedly stabbed in the chest.  This brought more questions over teachers’ safety in schools.
