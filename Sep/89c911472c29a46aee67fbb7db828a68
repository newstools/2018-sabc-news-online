Mineral Resources Minister Gwede Mantashe believes that a decision should be made soon on the proposed titanium dune mining at Xolobeni in Mbizana in the Eastern Cape. Several court battles have been fought over the issue in the past 18 years, which has split the community. The anti-mining group believes that it will threaten the environment and eco-tourism while the pro-mining group believes that it will alleviate poverty and create jobs in the area. Mantashe’s meeting with the community was disrupted on Sunday by members of the anti-mining group, the Amadiba Crisis Committee. Police fired rubber bullets to disperse the crowd. Mantashe says the moratorium on mining in the area has given the community time to consider the issue. “We are not going to leave this thing hanging forever. It must come to an end. If mining must go ahead, it must go ahead; if is not going ahead it must not go ahead. But a decision must be taken and we finalize it. The moratorium gives you space to do many interventions. Once you come to a point of action you lift the moratorium. That is how it works.” Amadiba Crisis Committee Chairperson Nontle Mbuthuma says they are not happy with the way the minister treated those who are opposed to mining. “It was unfair and it was a violation of human rights. As you see my eyes are red like this. I am being sprayed by teargas by the police without even carrying any weapon. When I fight for my land; when I fight for my right I am being sprayed like this. That is why we are so surprised that the South African Government that we voted for we think is a democracy for all of us, but there is no democracy.”
