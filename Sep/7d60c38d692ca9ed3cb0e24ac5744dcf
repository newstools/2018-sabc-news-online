DA Gauteng Premier candidate and Tshwane Mayor, Solly Msimanga, says he remains unfazed about the recent developments which almost saw him axed as Executive Mayor. Msimanga says he’s focusing on taking service delivery to the communities. He was on a listening tour to Saulsville, Atteridgeville west of Pretoria. Residents aren’t convinced Msimanga’s visit will improve their lives: “I’m feeling ok because the mayor is here I don’t have any problem but we want to see the mayor when he’s going to do those things we want to see those things,” said one resident. “For him to come here is just nothing he must come and act not come and visit and talk because actions speak louder than words,” added another one. But the mayor says he first has to see before he can act: “You don’t come and say ‘I have all the answers’; you need to understand what people are saying in order for you to come up with a valued proposal and that’s what we’re doing here . We are not arrogant to say we have all answers or we know what the people want . We are here to listen first at what people are saying and then we’ll be able to take it from there”. Msimanga says despite facing two motions of no confidence in him last week, people still have confidence in his party “People are still saying that we want to see our lives changing and we can see our lives changing.  It’s not a high speed as we would have wanted it to, but we can see that there are changes that are taking place so ours is to continue to engage our residents. Ours is to continue to inform our residents of the progress that we’re making”. Msimanga is to take the tour to other communities in the Province. He remains in the hot seat as the capital city’s Mayor for now.
