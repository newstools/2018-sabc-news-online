Protesters have blocked off roads leading in and out of Reigerpark in Ekurhuleni in what they are calling a complete shutdown of the area. It’s understood that the community is protesting against a lack of service delivery and the high crime rate in the area. Authorities have advised motorists travelling in that area to be cautious. Ekurhuleni metro police spokesperson Kobedi Mokheseng says police have been monitoring the area since 4:30. He says: “Most entrances like old Elsburg, Middle and Commissioner roads are blocked with burning tyres, rubble and rocks. Motorists are advised to use alternative roads. Working together with the SAPS and other law enforcement agencies we are keeping an eye and are on high alert.”
