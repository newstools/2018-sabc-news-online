The Democratic Alliance (DA) is eyeing three provinces in the 2019 general elections. Party leader, Mmusi Maimane, says they want to increase their majority in the Western Cape as well as win Gauteng and the Northern Cape. The DA launched their Western Cape election campaign in Cape Town on Saturday. Victory in three provinces and the reduction of  the African National Congress (ANC) majority in the national poll, is the target set by the DA for the 2019 election. Maimane announced the DA team that will lead their campaign in the Western Cape. They include provincial leader Bonginkosi Madikizela, Premier candidate Alan Winde and incoming Cape Town Mayor Dan Plato. He says they will emerge victorious. “We must make sure that whatever happens in this province can be replicated elsewhere and I’ve been proud to go to Gauteng and say to the people of Gauteng the DA is coming here and what we do to Gauteng is what we begun to do here. I say to the people of the Northern Cape ons kom in die Noord Kaap.”
