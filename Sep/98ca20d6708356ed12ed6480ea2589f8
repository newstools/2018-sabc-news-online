The Department of Home Affairs has announced that Minister Malusi Gigaba will institute defamation proceedings against media personality Redi Tlhabi. This is after Tlhabi failed to apologise for her tweets about travel regulation amendments. The official statement says Gigaba has instructed his attorneys to begin legal action. Gigaba earlier gave Tlhabi a deadline of Wednesday to apologise for her comments on Twitter. Gigaba this week announced changes to South Africa’s visa regulations for children travelling with their parents. Tlhabi suggested that the previous regulations had been crafted to suit Gigaba’s personal affairs.
