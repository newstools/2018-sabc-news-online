Congress of the People (COPE) Deputy President Willie Madisha says the late environmental affairs Minister Edna Molewa should be remembered for her vital role she played in protecting the rights of the workers during her times as a trade unionist. The former Congress of SA Trade Unions (Cosatu) president who worked with Molewa in both the teaching and labour sectors visited the Molewa home in Waterkloof Ridge in Pretoria to pay his last respects. “I worked with her both in the teaching fraternity and beyond that. We worked together in Cosatu and she was able to rise as a shop steward , worked for workers of the hand, workers of the mind, represented our people and did her best and therefore this is extremely sad.” Molewa passed away last Saturday at age 61. The ANC NEC is also expected to visit the Molewa’s home on Saturday evening.  WATCH BELOW:
