Nedbank Chief Executive Officer Mike Brown says during the inter-ministerial meeting, former Mineral Resources Minister Mosebenzi Zwane asked if Nedbank had colluded with the other major banks in the decision to close the Gupta-company-linked account. Brown says he made it clear that he was not in a position to discuss client information. He says Zwane further suggested for Nedbank to take over the primary banking facilities of the Gupta related companies, given the fact that other banks had closed their accounts. Nedbank is the third bank to appear before the State Capture Commission of Inquiry this week. Brown says he found it strange that a meeting of the inter-ministerial committee to which he was invited, was to be chaired by  Zwane without the then-Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan even being present. He pointed out that the finance ministry is the custodian of the regulatory framework under which banks operate. Brown says the meeting was to take place at Zwane’s office in Pretoria.
