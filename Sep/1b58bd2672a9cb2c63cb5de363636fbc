The Economic Freedom Fighters in the Northern Cape has vowed to increase on the number of votes it received during the 2014 general elections. The party received about 5% of the votes in 2014 and says it will focus on winning an outright majority in the province in next year’s general elections. The EFF is holding its elective provincial people’s assembly in Upington. Newly-elected provincial secretary Shadrack Tlhaole says the EFF is more prepared than it was in the last election. “The decisions of this conference are to improve we were lacking in making sure that the EFF grows in the Northern Cape and I am confident that the EFF will do better in getting its house in order. We are more organised. We are more prepared and determined to make sure that the EFF contributes positively in changing the lives of ordinary people.”
