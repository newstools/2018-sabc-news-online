Some leaders of the four African National Congress (ANC) regional executive committees (REC) in North West, who are in support of the dissolution of the Provincial Executive Committee (PEC), have distanced themselves from calls to pressure the National Executive Committee (NEC) to reverse the decision. Earlier last week the ANC’s Secretary-General, Ace Magashule was issued a letter from some members of the four RECs challenging the disbandment of the PEC. The members are also threatening to take the matter to court, should the decision not be reversed. However the demand for the reinstatement of the PEC has also been criticised as undermining the decision of the party’s highest structure. It seems the decision of the NEC is unlikely to be reversed, as ANC NEC convener Obed Bapela says the dissolution of structures by the NEC is nothing new Click video below:
