Police have arrested two men who were part of a gang that robbed a store of an undisclosed amount of cash at the Buzz World shopping centre in Douglasdale, North of Johannesburg. It’s alleged the thieves entered Betting World Sunday morning, held staff at gunpoint and demanded money. Police spokesperson Kay Makhubele says the men then fled on foot. Two of them were arrested shortly after the incident and the money was recovered. Police are still searching for the other suspects. Makhubele says: “We are investigating a case of armed robbery and the possession of stolen property.”
