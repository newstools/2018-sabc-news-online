Parliament has expressed shock at the death of Minister of Environmental Affairs Edna Molewa. According to a statement released on Saturday afternoon,  “The Presiding Officers of Parliament, Speaker of the National Assembly, Ms Baleka Mbete and Chairperson of the National Council of Provinces, Ms Thandi Modise, have run short of words to express their deep sorrow and disbelief at losing such a fine and dedicated servant leader of the people, and one of the longest serving Members of Parliament.” They statements says Minister Molewa’s passion for sustainable development is anchored on the full appreciation of the environment as the source of prosperity, growth and human development, and permeated every facet of the work as Parliament, nationally and internationally. Parliament says Molewa worked with absolute dedication and integrity since becoming a Member of Parliament in 1994. “Parliament cherishes her contributions in building South Africa’s young Parliament and all its systems, as she became the first female Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Trade and Industry in 1994.” Molewa’s passing has been described as a tragedy and a great loss to the country, Africa and the world. “Minister Molewa leaves us at a critical time when some of the warnings about environmental degradation have come to pass. We trust that on the occasion of passing on, millions more people in this country and across the world would make new pledges to spare no effort in protecting our environment. “ Parliament has extended its condolences to Molewa’s family.
