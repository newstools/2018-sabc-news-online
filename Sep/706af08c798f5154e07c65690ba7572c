The African Farmers’ Association of South Africa (Afasa) has thrown its weight behind the amendment of the constitution to allow for land redistribution without compensation. The African National Congress (ANC) met with the Afasa in Kempton Park as part of an on-going dialogue aimed to clarify the land policy to affected stakeholders. At the top of the agenda at this land dialogue was who will be the beneficiaries. The association also tabled its concerns to the governing party, arguing that government does not have plans for black farmers. They said black farmers are struggling to access the markets. Meanwhile, clarifying its stance on the land issue, the ANC re-assured farmers that its land policy was being applied with caution. The party emphasized that expropriated land will be for public purpose and distributed to South Africans. This consultation comes after some farmers expressed concerns about the policy during parliamentary public hearings amid fears that every piece of land including commercial farms will be placed in the hands of the state.
