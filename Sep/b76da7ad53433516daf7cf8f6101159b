Convicted family axe murderer, Henri van Breda, has now approached the Supreme Court of Appeal in Bloemfontein after he was denied leave to appeal his conviction and sentence in the Western Cape High Court in June this year. The triple murderer isÂ  pinning his hope on the Appeal court to come to a different verdict. In handing down sentence at the Western Cape High Court, Judge Siraj Desai, found the 23 year old Van Breda guilty and sentenced him to three life sentences for murdering his parents and his brother. Van Breda has however maintained his innocence and claims an intruder attacked his family. Van Breda has accused the Western Cape High Court for misdirecting itself by concluding that the proven facts are only consistent with a finding that he was the person who attacked his family.
