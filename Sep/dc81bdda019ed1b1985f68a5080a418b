The new Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) president Zingiswa Losi says the current situation at the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) needs urgent government intervention. The public broadcaster has confirmed that it will embark on a process to retrench workers in two months’ time after consulting with labour unions. The SABC has attributed its decision to financial constraints. Meanwhile, Parliament’s Portfolio on Communications is expected to meet with members of the SABC board and senior executives next week to discuss the looming retrenchments. Losi says SABC workers are being punished for what their previous executives did. “Alternatives must be found by the government of South Africa. It can’t be that the first victims are going to be workers when those that took decisions to do corrupt activities were those that were seated in air conditioned offices of the SABC. It can’t be that it’s workers who are waking up in the early hours of the morning to cover the news in this country that a going to be affected as a result of the looting that has taken place in the state-owned enterprise. So, Cosatu will continue to stand by the workers at the SABC,” says Losi. Watch related video below
