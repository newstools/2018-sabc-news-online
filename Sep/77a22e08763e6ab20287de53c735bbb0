A multi-vehicle crash has claimed four lives in Hazyview, Mpumalanga and injured 11 others. The accident happened on the R536 road between Hazyview and Kruger National Park, in the early hours of Sunday morning. The accident involved three sedans, a taxi and a bakkie. One person was trapped inside one of the sedans for hours before paramedics could rescue the victim. Those injured are being treated at a local clinic. Since Thursday 12 people have died on Mpumalangaâ€™s roads, authorities blame this on speeding. On Saturday, traffic officers began a shift system in the province which means traffic officials will be on duty 24 hours.
