The 18-year-old teenager, who was accused of taking part in the murder of the secretary at the Rabboni Private Christian School near Brits in North West, has been found not guilty of her murder in the High Court in Pretoria. The teenager’s 19-year old co-accused had earlier pleaded guilty to shooting Hester Koster twice in the head, in November 2016. He was sentenced to 53 years in jail, of which he must serve 25 years. The boys were 16 and 17 years old at the time of the crime. Acting Judge Hattingh said he believed the 18-year-old did not know his friend wanted to hijack Koster or kill her. The family of the acquitted teenager burst into tears of joy after the verdict. “We knew he was innocent from the first time we heard about this thing. I just want to say I thank God that justice prevailed today. It’s been a rough two to three years, where we almost lost everything. We almost lost him when he wanted to commit suicide, but I thank the Lord.”
