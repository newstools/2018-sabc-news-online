A two-day inquiry into allegations of the sale of fake and expired goods at shops operated by foreign nationals kicksoff on Wednesday in Braamfontein, Johannesburg. The allegations led to incidents of looting and unrest in Soweto and surrounding townships. The Human Rights Commission says after assessing reports and conducting site visits to the affected areas it has decided to hold the inquiry. The commission says it has invited all stakeholders. These include municipalities who provide inspectors and corporates such as Tiger Brands and Pioneer Foods, local shop owners, foreign shop owners and the public. Related Video:
