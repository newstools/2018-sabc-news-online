The North Gauteng High Court in Pretoria will on Thursday morning hear a challenge by the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) to the use of the apartheid-era Riotous Assembly Act to charge its leader, Julius Malema. The same court will today hear an application for leave to appeal brought by former President Jacob Zuma against a legal costs order. The EFF believes the Riotous Assembly Act is an apartheid piece of legislation which was enacted to fight the Freedom Charter. It says the Act was the basis of the famous Rivonia Treason Trial. The EFF accuses the ANC government of having used that legislation to charge its leader Julius Malema, for calling for the occupation of vacant land by the landless people. Malema currently faces charges in Bloemfontein and Newcastle. The second application pertains to Zuma’s leave to appeal a last year December court ruling ordering him to personally pay legal costs of reviewing Thuli Madonsela’s remedial action for the institution of the State Capture inquiry. The EFF and other parties will be opposing Zuma’s application. Click below for related video…
