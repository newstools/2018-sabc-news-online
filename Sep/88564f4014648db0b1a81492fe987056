The executive director of Media Monitoring Africa, William Bird has accused the previous SABC administrations of allowing the public broadcaster to deteriorate. The SABC confirmed last week that it would embark on a process to retrench workers in two months’ time after consulting with labour unions. However, Communications Minister Nomvula Mokonyane says the SABC board has not followed the due process of informing Parliament Portfolio Committee on Communications about its looming retrenchments. Bird says Mokonyane does not seem to understand the SABC’s problems. “For her to be suggesting that all they are looking at is retrenchments I think that’s just not accurate and just not true. What we’re seeing here is more of a backlash from the ANC rather than legitimate concern for issues and in fact what we need to be doing is talking to the workers and find out what the management structures are finding out and what the retrenchment process might be like.”
