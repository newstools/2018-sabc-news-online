Three people killed in violent confrontations between suspected gangsters and Boitumelong residents in the North West were buried in separate funerals on Saturday. Their families remain grieving with few questions answered. Family and friends gathered to lay 33-year-old Mooketsi Letjia Motseku to rest, one of the suspected gangsters.  He was accused of terrorising the community and being a member of the notorious Kak 7 gang. His father, Phillip Motseku says that he was killed like a snake. “They went for his head and smashed it apart. Every time we see taxi drivers, it doesn’t settle well with us. As a family we have been gravelly affected because Bloemhof is not rested.” While an uneasy calm remains over Bloemhof one wonders how long this will last with many in the community still divided and it seems for those left behind, the road to forgiveness is still a long way to travel.   One gang member who wishes to remain anonymous says: “I feel more hurt than ever. For me there is no going forward because I don’t allow any of the taxis in my neighbourhood anymore because they discriminate against us and showed us that we are animals and they are people.” Meanwhile, police continue to maintain a heavy presence in the area.
