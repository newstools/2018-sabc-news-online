The Ahmed Kathrada Foundation has slammed the Gupta family as ‘arrogant’ after their lawyers suggested that they participate via video link in the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture. The Gupta bothers are believed to be unwilling to return to South Africa for fear of being arrested on accusations related to state capture. Chairperson of the inquiry, Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo, is expected to make a ruling this week on whether the Guptas will be allowed to testify via video link. Executive Director of the Ahmed Kathrada Foundation, Neeshan Balton, says this would amount to giving the Guptas preferential treatment. “I think we must certainly do all that is possible to get them back to appear before the commission and to appear before any court of law as soon as the Hawks and the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) can get their act together as well.” “The commission has given people like Themba Maseko and others a platform to really go into depths with regards to their experiences and observations. I think that is why we are getting an immense sense of the depths of state capture and the mode of operation most importantly,” explains Balton. Click below for State Capture Inquiry….
