The SABC believes the BCCSA ruling has upheld the editorial independence of its News division. The Broadcasting Complaints Commission of South Africa has found that the SABC did not contravene the Broadcasting Code when it aired President Cyril Ramaphosa’s pre-recorded address about land reform in his capacity as president of the African National Congress (ANC). The Democratic Alliance (DA) took the broadcaster to the BCCSA, demanding that their leader be afforded equal time to fairly express the opposition party’s views on the issue. The SABC argued that it had provided the DA with an opportunity to air its view on the matter, within a reasonable time and offering an appropriate platform. The BCCSA agreed with this and ruled in favour of the SABC. The SABC says the ruling also affirms the “Independence and Impartiality” of its newsroom.
