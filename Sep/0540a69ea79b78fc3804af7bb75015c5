Lesotho Prime Minister Tom Thabane has suspended the Chief Justice Nthomeng Majara with the intention to impeach her. In her place Thabane has appointed Judge Maseforo Mahase. The Prime Minister’s move blatantly ignores a May warning by the African Judges and Jurists Forum and the International Commission of Jurists to keep his hands off the executive, off the judiciary, and to stop threatening Majara. The Chief Justice is accused of being wasteful in renting a house for 27 000 – which is more than her allowance – and of conflict of interest because the house belongs to another judge. For this, the Minister of Law, Lebohang Hlaele, who is also the Prime Minister’s son-in-law, has publicly said the Chief Justice should resign or face impeachment But the Chief Justice says her removal is politically motivated and she is fighting it. International Judges bodies have warned that the power of the Prime Minister to advise the King to remove or appoint judicial officers is not in line with international standards – and gives rise to the perception that the appointments or impeachment action against them may be politically motivated.
