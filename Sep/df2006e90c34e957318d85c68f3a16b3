KwaZulu-Natal police say an IFP leader in the uThukela district of the Midlands was killed in a drive-by shooting by attackers who used high calibre weapons. Zakhele Mazibuko, who was the IFP’s publicity secretary in the district, was ambushed as he was travelling between Estcourt and Ladysmith after a party meeting. Police spokesperson Thembeka Mbele says the attackers shot with rifles at the BMW Mazibuko was travelling in. She has appealed to anyone with information that can lead to the arrest of the attackers to contact the police. She says: “At the moment the police are at an early stage of the investigation and there have been no arrests made.”   “A great loss” The IFP in KwaZulu-Natal has described the death of its leader as a great loss. KwaZulu-Natal IFP secretary Velenkosini Hlabisa has sent the party’s condolences to Mazibuko’s family. Hlabisa has called on party members to allow the police to investigate the murder. “As a political party if you lose one of your soldiers, you are one person short, in all the activities that you have been doing. Mr Mazibuko was a leader at a district level, publicity Secretary of the IFP, but we want to call upon all our members of the IFP and the public in general of uThukela to be calm and not start speculating about this incident.”
