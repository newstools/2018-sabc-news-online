The African National Congress (ANC) in the Free State has kicked off its two-day Lekgotla in Bloemfontein. The Lekgotla is expected to assess the provincial government’s progress and weaknesses. It comes in a wake of serious factionalism in the party in the province. Speaking at the opening of the Lekgotla, ANC NEC member David Mahlobo urged members of the party to be disciplined. Mahlobo told delegates that next year’s elections will not be an easy one for the party. He encouraged ANC members to respect resolutions and policies of the party. The Lekgotla will also be used to discuss issues about land.
