Moving tributes were paid to Khathutshelo Meshack Muedi, one of three firemen who died trying to put out a fire at the Bank of Lisbon building in Johannesburg’s CBD last Wednesday. Emergency personnel from around the country turned up in huge numbers at his funeral in Dzwerani, Limpopo. Muedi was described by many as a gallant but unassuming fire fighter. A man who showed unwavering passion for his job.
He was accorded a full brigade funeral, the highest honour bestowed on a fireman who dies while on duty. “To the rest of the firefighters we are saying they are gone, but they are not yet forgotten. We will always remember them as our heroes, public service people, who had dedicated their lives to save people and we are saying we will be strong and move forward and make sure that this same tragedy doesn’t repeat itself. And also we are saying to the firefighters that the must be strong and move forward and also serve our communities with pride,” said  Demawusa’s Terrence Kgaffe. The tragedy has again highlighted concerns over the shortage of resources for firefighters. But the Johannesburg Emergency Management Services (EMS) says it’s being addressed. “We are working towards making sure that we replace most of our firstly aging fleet of fire engines. This financial year we will be procuring about 25 fire engines as the mayor said. In future we are looking at replacing all our fleet to make sure that we can be able to render effective and professional services to all the residents of the City of Johannesburg,” said Johannesburg Emergency Management Services spokesperson, Robert Mulaudzi. Hundreds of mourners descended on the rural Limpopo village to pay their last respects to Muedi. Muedi is survived by his wife and three children. Watch video below:
