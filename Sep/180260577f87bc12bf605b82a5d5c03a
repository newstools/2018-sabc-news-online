The SARS Commission of Inquiry has started in Pretoria. Former partner of Bain & Company, Vittorio Massone is taking the witness stand. Massone was recently relieved from his position following his testimony which revealed that the agency followed an irregular tender process to win the restructuring work at SARS. Bainâ€™s operating model is alleged to have dismantled key units and destroyed efficiencies at the revenue collector, which has led to the loss of skilled staff.
