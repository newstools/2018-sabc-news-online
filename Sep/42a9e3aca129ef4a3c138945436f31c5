The political party squabble in Midvaal heads to court on Monday when both the Democratic Alliance’s (DA) Mayor, Bongani Baloyi  and African National Congress (ANC) community liaison officer, Rembuluwani Malange, are due to appear in the Vereeniging magistrate’s court in Gauteng. A scuffle erupted when ANC supporters tried to stop Baloyi from giving an Arbor Day speech at Savannah City on Saturday. DA provincial leader, John Moodey has condemned the incident. “It’s a very unfortunate incident. It’s pointing to the fact that there is intolerance in the ANC and its supporters. We will never leave this matter unchallenged. He has laid an assault charges against the perpetrators and we will be following to make that they see day in court. We cannot afford this in the democracy of ours to come under threat by hooliganism,” says Moodey Baloyi and Malange were arrested after a scuffle led to the two laying counter-charges of assault against each other. Both were released on R500 bail by the Vereeniging magistrate’s court in the Vaal Triangle. The DA says the ANC is attempting to retain power with thug behaviour ahead of next year’s elections. The ANC has accused Baloyi of politicising the Arbour Day event.
