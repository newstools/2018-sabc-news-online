Metrorail authorities have pledged to co-operate with Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane’s investigation into alleged maladministration at the commuter rail agency. Last month, Chairperson of the Standing Committee for Transport in the Western Cape, Nceba Hinana wrote to Mkhwebane to request a probe into Metrorail assets and financial affairs. Hinana says Metrorail trains are being torched frequently but no one is being held accountable. He also alleges that the State Entity is being run to the ground. Metrorail spokesperson Riana Scott says any investigation is welcome. She says: “We have been informed on Sunday that the Public Protector has been asked to investigate the region. We respect obviously any process of investigation, there is nothing to hide and the region will fully cooperate with the Public Protector’s office.”
