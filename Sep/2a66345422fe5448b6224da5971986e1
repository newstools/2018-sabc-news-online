Cape Town Police have confirmed that at least one of the train fires in the city on Friday was an act of arson. Three trains caught alight at three different stations in a space of three hours. Police spokesperson, Andre Traut, says before one of the fires at Mbekweni station near Paarl, there was a shooting incident on the train in which a boy was killed. “In Mbekweni, a 16 year old male was shot and killed when he and three of his accomplices allegedly attempted to rob a man on the train which was en-route to Cape Town from Wellington. This train was later set alight while it was stationery due to the crime scene investigation.” He says circumstances surrounding the fires in Firgrove and Cape Town railway station are also being investigated.
