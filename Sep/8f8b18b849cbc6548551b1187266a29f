The Constitutional Court has ruled that former social development minister Bathabile Dlamini is personally liable for 20 percent of the legal costs in the court case linked to the SASSA grants debacle. The court says the Ngoepe Inquiry into the payment of social grants by CPS found that Dlamini had misled them in an attempt to avoid paying legal costs. The ConCourt also ruled that the NPA must look into whether Dlamini should be prosecuted for perjury in this regard.
