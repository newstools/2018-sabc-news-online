Hundreds of firefighters could not hold back their tears as one of their colleagues, who died in Johannesburg’s Bank of Lisbon fire, was laid to rest in Newcastle in northern KwaZulu-Natal on Sunday afternoon. Some formed a guard of honour for Ndlovu, while others carried his coffin to the grave site. Friends and family members say Ndlovu was preparing for his wedding in December. Democratic Municipal and Allied Workers Union of South Africa representative, Bonginkosi Dlangamandla, used the occasion to call on local governments to prioritise the safety of firefighters. This is the last of three funerals for the fallen heroes, who died after a fire broke out in the Johannesburg CBD last week. Ndlovu, Simphiwe Moropane, Khathutshelo Muedi and other firefighters were battling a blaze that started on the 23rd floor of the Bank of Lisbon building, which housed three provincial government departments. “He lost his life while he was rendering services to the residents of Johannesburg. In that building there were over 100 people which he managed to save on that day. Unfortunately he lost his life there. So from our side as EMS, we are proud of him and all the contributions he has done – his extraordinary courage, his selfless service – and we promise to preserve the legacy which he has left behind so we can continue to render,” says Johannesburg Emergency Services Spokesperson, Robert Mulaudzi.
