Dagga activists say although they welcome the decriminalisation of cannabis, drug education is needed in order for people to use it responsibly. On Tuesday, the Constitutional Court announced the decriminalisation of dagga for private use but says people may be arrested if they are suspected of being in possession of cannabis for dealing purposes. Opinions on the judgment are deeply divided. Dagga activist, Myrtle Clarke says: “I think it will be positive because the cannabis community who have been using this plant privately, nothing will change except for the fact that they won’t jump out of their skin when they see a police car or see the blue lights or hear the sirens.” She says cannabis is not harmless, it is a fairly benign plant. “It is something that has never led to the death of anybody but it is not harmless and that is where drug education comes in. We have to really rewrite drug education and counter the hysterical fear-based propaganda when it comes to cannabis and have a national discussion about this,” adds Clarke.
