A 45-year-old man is due to appear in the Verulam Magistrateâ€™s Court north of Durban facing three charges of murder. This follows the killings of a 44 year old Phoenix mother Janelle Govindsamy and her daughters Rackelle and Denisha last Friday. KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson Thulani Zwane says their bodies were discovered inside their flat last week. Zwane says the man was linked to the triple murder that was reported in the Phoenix area on Friday. Its alleged the mother and her two daughters were brutally killed by the suspect and as a result the Phoenix police opened three counts of murder. The motive for their killing is still unknown at this stage but the matter is under investigation.
