Three police officers who were arrested for armed robbery and corruption are appearing at Bela-Bela magistrate’s court in Limpopo on Tuesday. The officers were arrested on Friday by the Hawks after they allegedly robbed a man of R190 000. A fourth officer escaped during the arrest. Hawks spokesperson Matimba Maluleke says, “The complainant had just won cash at a local casino outlet when the four police officers allegedly approached him. They threatened to arrest him if he did not give them the cash. They took him to a disused house where they allegedly pointed a firearm at him before robbing him.” They were arrested at the Bela Bela police station while on duty after an identification parade.
