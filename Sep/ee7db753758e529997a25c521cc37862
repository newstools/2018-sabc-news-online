The SABC says Parliament’s Portfolio Committee on Communications was very supportive of the board’s plans to turn the fortunes of the public broadcaster around. Board members and executives outlined the SABC’s turnaround plan before the committee and then faced questions. Board chairperson Bongumusa Makhathini told the committee that the public broadcaster had appointed top executives with the ability to implement the plan. It includes dealing with governance issues, regulatory constraints and implementation of operational strategies. Makhathini says the SABC will stick to the letter of the law regarding any retrenchment process. The public broadcaster plans to cut the corporation’s R3.1 billion salary bill. Section 189 of the Labour Relations Act could see the retrenchment of hundreds of workers to cut costs.   Click video below:
