Two men have been sentenced to life imprisonment in the High Court in Durban for the 2016 murder of retired teacher Shakila Singh. Apart from the life sentences handed down to Amon Ngoni and Ally Kumar Abdullah on the murder charge, they and their co-accused Nonjabulo Mteki were sentenced to 15-years in prison for robbery. Judge Burt Laing ordered that the sentences be served concurrently. Mteki worked for Singh as a domestic worker for 14-years. The court found that she conspired with the two men to rob Singh.
