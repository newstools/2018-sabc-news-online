Johannesburg Emergency Services will host a memorial service on Wednesday for three firefighters who died battling a blaze at the Bank of Lisbon building. Mduduzi Ndlovu, Simphiwe Moropane and Meshack Muedi will be laid to rest between Friday and Sunday in three different provinces. The fire broke out on the 23rd floor of the building in the Johannesburg CBD last Wednesday. The building accommodated three Gauteng government departments. It proved to be one of eight non-safety-compliant government buildings in the city centre. The memorial service will begin on Wednesday morning with a wreath laying-ceremony at the scene of the fire. City of Johannesburg Emergency Management Services (EMS) spokesperson Robert Mulaudzi says, “The proceedings will proceed to the main memorial service, which will be held at the Ellis Park arena from 11:30 in the morning. We would like to honour and remember our colleagues for their dedication and immense contribution towards the safety of all the residents of the City of Johannesburg.”
