The DA’s Western Cape premier candidate, Alan Winde, has outlined his plans for the province when he takes over the reins. Winde, who is the provincial minister of economic opportunities, was announced as the DA’s premiership candidate on Wednesday. He will be standing to replace Helen Zille next year. Winde says he will focus on, among other things;  improving the education and healthcare system, growing the economy, and working with police to ensure community safety. “As a provincial government the main responsibility given by the constitution will be continuing to spend on education and on health. I would continue with growth and jobs creating and an environment for the economy to grow. We’ve also got to work closely with our local authorities that have put police in place. There is a lot of work that we need to do for a safe environment for our communities. I would also focus on public transport. Our train systems have not been invested in for way too long and the public transport system linking into our bus and taxi systems. We need to do a lot more there.” Watch below for more:
