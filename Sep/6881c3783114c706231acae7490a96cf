The United Nations World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO) has emphasised the need for increased investment in digital technologies to create an environment of innovation and entrepreneurship in tourism. This as South Africa joins the rest of the world to mark World Tourism Day. In 2018 Tourism Month activities are being hosted in collaboration with the Eastern Cape – the birthplace of former President Nelson Mandela and Mama Albertina Sisulu. The Tourism Department has encourages travellers to visit the sights connected to these great icons. Minister Derek Hanekom has welcomed changes to ease visa requirements in order to boost tourism in the country. “The impact of the visa regulations and particular the requirements for children travelling with single parents or travelling alone was having quite a devastating impact on family travel, and so we had set of negotiations.” “We came to agreement on what’s needed to be put in place to find the balance between combating child trafficking because we must take it seriously, and not discourage people from visiting South Africa. So, creating a more visitor-friendly visa regime. Yes, I am very satisfied.” WATCH RELATED VIDEO BELOW:
