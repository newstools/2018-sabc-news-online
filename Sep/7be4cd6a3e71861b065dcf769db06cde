Police Minister Bheki Cele is expected to visit the University of Zululand on the KwaZulu-Natal north coast on Wednesday, after an incident in which a student allegedly stabbed his fellow student to death. The institution says it cannot suspend academic activities as some students are about to write their examinations. Students have called on university management to improve security at residences on and off campus. A 20-year-old student Sazi Ngubo was allegedly stabbed to death by his roommate. The motive for the killing remains unknown. Angry students threw stones and other objects at the suspect severely wounding him. The suspect remains in hospital under police guard.
