The United Christian Democratic Party’s (UCDP) Federal Congress is expected to re-launch the party this weekend with the youth tipped to lead the UCDP into 2019 general elections. The once prominent opposition party in the North West legislature between 1999 and 2004 has slipped back to a small force in the province with dwindling membership. The UCDP was at its strongest when led by former homeland leader Kgosi Lucas Mangope who passed away in January this year. Party spokesperson Pule Serapelo Serapelo says they will be renewing the party leadership structures and will champion issues affecting communities. “Our membership went down, but we have a plan. We are dissolving all the structures we had since 2009, and replacing them with new ones. It is different from the past where you will put people in positions who are not credible. We will have a youth president as a party leader, young people in terms of national executive, we are renewing our party.”
