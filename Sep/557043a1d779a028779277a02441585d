The SABC says it will prioritise the payment of salaries despite its current financial crisis. The SABC board presented its Turnaround Strategy to Parliament‘s Portfolio Committee on Communications earlier this week. This follows the public broadcaster’s announcement that it plans on cutting its R3.1 billion salary bill, which includes possible retrenchments. SABC Chief Financial Officer Yolande van Biljon says the priority when it comes to payment priorities is to execute the payroll. “To execute the payroll is the very first priority when it comes to payment priorities. So even if the funds are significantly constraint. If we need to cut, that’s definitely not the place where we take fund from. So, in the order of priority, it’s the payroll. It’s then that kind of things that ensure we remain operational … I call it lights and water kind of stuff, and then everything else follows from that.”
