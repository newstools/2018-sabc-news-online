Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo is on Wednesday expected to formally hear all applications for cross-examination of witnesses at the Commission of Inquiry on State Capture. Several people implicated in testimonies by former ANC MP Vytjie Mentor and former deputy finance minister Mcebisi Jonas have applied to cross-examine them. Others who have made the requests include former Public Enterprises Minister Lynn Brown, businessman Fana Hlongwane and former President Jacob Zuma’s chief of staff, Lakela Kaunda. Hawks officials Major General Zinhle Mnonopi and Mandla Mtolo have also submitted applications to cross-examine witnesses. Meanwhile,  Zuma’s lawyers say they have not made the request as they believe Zuma has not been criminally implicated. Related Video
