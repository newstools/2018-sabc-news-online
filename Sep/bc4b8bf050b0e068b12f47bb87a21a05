The South African Federation of Trade Unions (Saftu) says they are angered by the death of eight people killed in an explosion at the Rheinmettal Denel munitions plant near Somerset West in the Western Cape on Monday. The explosion occurred during operations. Details surrounding the incident are still sketchy at this stage. The factory produces explosives and propellants for civilian and military use in ammunition. Saftu General Secretary Zwelinzima Vavi says, “We can’t say we are shocked because this is not happening for the first time but we are angered that this is allowed to continue to happen in such a delicate factory that produces explosives for civil and military use.” “We now demand that a full investigation be conducted to see why there is a repeat of the same explosion.” Click video below:
