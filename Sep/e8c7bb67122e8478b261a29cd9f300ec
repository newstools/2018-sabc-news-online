Some disgruntled members of the African National Congress (ANC) in the North West have initiated a legal battle against the party’s national leadership, following the dissolution of its Provincial Executive Committee (PEC). The group says the decision to dissolve the PEC was unconstitutional and irrational and they have thus filed papers with the South Gauteng High Court. Aaron Motswana, former PEC member says: “We so believe strongly that the reasons provided are not based on the principles of the organisation but rather a factional purge that seeks to deal with those with a different view towards Nasrec. That was for us what really motivated the NEC to arrive at this particular harsh decision.” A scathing attack on some members of the newly-formed provincial task team (PTT) soon followed. Motswana adds: “Some of those particular members who are being put in as PTT members did not have valid membership or were members not in good standing of the ANC. Some of those members were on the ground mobilising against the ANC and some didn’t bother to participate in the by-elections that have been taking place in the province.” The spokesperson of the convener of the PTT and North West premier, Job Mokgoro, referred the SABC to the spokesperson of the PTT for comment. Attempts to get hold of him have been unsuccessful. The matter is expected to be heard at the South Gauteng High Court on 23 October. WATCH RELATED VIDEO BELOW:
