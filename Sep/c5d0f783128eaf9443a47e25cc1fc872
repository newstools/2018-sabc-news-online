Head of Make SA Safe, Yusuf Abramjee says there is no quick fix solution in tackling crime in the country. Abramjee was reacting to the latest crime statistics revealed in Parliament on Tuesday. Officials from the Police Ministry announced an increase in cash in transit heists and murders of women and children in the 2017/18 financial year. He says the greater community also needs to take a stand against crime. “We need a multifaceted approach, the police need to be resourced and the community needs to mobilise, we all need to join hands, we need partnerships at every level. We need communities to start taking ownership and to start taking to the streets to say that ‘we are now reclaiming our streets.’ We need the business community to come on board. So I think the quicker everyone can unite, hold hands, the quicker we’ll be able to fight this scourge of crime,” says Abramjee. Meanwhile, the Institute for Security Studies (ISS) says it is unfair to rely solely on the police for a crime-free society. It has reiterated the need for a holistic approach to fighting crime in the country. Senior Research Consultant at ISS, Johan Burger says, “Government needs to attend at a much higher, strategic level to the socio-economic conditions that underlie much of our crime so that there’s a common understanding. It’s unfair to rely only on police and the criminal justice system to solve our crime problem.”
