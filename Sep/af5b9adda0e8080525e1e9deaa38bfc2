Transnet has announced it will start working on the R7.7 billion berth reconstruction project of the Durban Container Terminal (DCT). The New Development Bank established by Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa (BRICS) has approved a loan of R2.5 billion for the project. The expansion will enable the port to accommodate newer generation vessels by 2023 and enhance capacity. Project director Johnny Mokheseng says the terminal was only able to handle two vessels at a time which caused major backlogs. He says many vessels had to queu at outer anchorage. He says: â€œThis will assist terminal operation as we will be able to receive the bigger vessels, which have bigger draft and they are quite long. We will be able to receive about three of 350 meter length vessels at the DCT.
