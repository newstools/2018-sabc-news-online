District Six residents are expected to gather at the Zonnebloem College on Monday morning to discuss school safety and transportation of children following a spate of abductions reported in Cape Town. Numerous kidnapping cases of learners have been reported around school premises including Zonnebloem, Rylands Estate and Steenberg. The most recent abducted and rape involved a 15 year old learner in the Steenberg area. Zonnebloem community representative, Karen Breytenbach says they are all concerned about what happens when they take their kids to school. “There have been many complains about just the way children are getting to school. We also had two girls kidnapped in the area in the past three weeks. Everybody is quiet concerned about how that can happen; that two girls can be kidnapped in broad daylight walking to or from school. Then we had other crime incident in the area with children getting mugged and harassed”.
