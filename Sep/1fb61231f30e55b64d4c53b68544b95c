The Department of Transport says about 1547 vehicles are going through the Kranskop Toll Plaza per hour on the N1 in Limpopo. This as thousands of motorists has started travelling back from ZCC’s Moria headquarters. Several traffic officers have been deployed at major roads especially on the R71 and the N1 to control traffic. About nine people have lost their lives at the weekend in the province. Limpopo MEC for Transport Makoma Makhuruphetje, speaking at a roadblock on the R71 in Polokwane, says the number of road fatalities in the area has fallen this year compared to this time last year. “At least this year we managed to have our road users’ safe on the roads even the road crashes and fatalities on R71 have reduced dramatically. We have worked very well with people who were going to Moria by last night all buses were in. Now everybody will be going back to Gauteng and our worry is the exit from Polokwane, but we have issued a statement to request all road users who are not coming from church to make sure before 14h00 they must have exited Polokwane. We are going to use the N1 and R101 as the exit.” WATCH BELOW:
