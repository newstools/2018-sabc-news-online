A newly launched Mahikeng Telescope Observatory will likely turn the provincial capital city into an astrononomical hub particularly for rural and disadvantaged communities. Professors in Astronomy say this instrument is extraordinary, as it will allow people to penetrate the galaxy and discover fascinating things in the universe. Minister for Science and Technology Mmamoloko Kubayi-Ngubane who attended its launch at the North West University’s Mahikeng Campus encouraged the general public to take full advantage of it. The University’s Mahikeng Campus, is the first historically disadvantaged higher learning institution in the country to develop such an observatory. Kubayi-Ngubane says: “South Africa needs to increase the number of Astronomers in the country and to help grow an astronomy community that is diverse and inclusive. We have to make sure that children who have a keen interest in Astronomy need to be guided in the right direction and be given the experience of discovering something wonderful.” Click below for the full story:
