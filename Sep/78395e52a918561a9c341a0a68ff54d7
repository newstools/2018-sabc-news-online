President Cyril Ramaphosa says the initiative between labour, government and business, Youth Employment Services (YES), will ensure that young graduates are employed in the corporate sector. Ramaphosa is answering oral questions in the National Council of Provinces (NCOP). Ramaphosa says the youth are the hardest hit when it comes to unemployment, with figures between 38 and 39%. “The question that young people who are graduates have raised that they go to universities and TVET colleges and get qualifications and in the end don’t get employment, so we are responding to this. But at the same time we are also calling on the private sector to employ young graduates in their ranks. And the private sector in this regard, which is part of the YES initiative, will ensure placements occur within all sectors of our economy. Big businesses will also facilitate placement of young people in small and medium enterprises.” Watch video below:
