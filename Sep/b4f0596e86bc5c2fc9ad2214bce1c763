President Cyril Ramaphosa says the entire executive and his cabinet will undergo lifestyle audits. He was answering questions in the National Council of Provinces (NCOP) on Tuesday afternoon. The Democratic Alliance (DA)’s Jacques Julius wanted to know how far the process is and whether Deputy President David Mabuza will undergo a lifestyle audit. Ramaphosa had made the promise during the Joint State of the Nation Debate that lifestyle audits will be conducted starting with himself. The President says there is no need to rush. He says a comprehensive process is underway and will be finalised soon. “Allow us space and time to be able to finalise this. In fact you want a time frame? I can tell you that we are going to have this by the end of October, we should be able to really have a robust system of lifestyle audit so we are going to be able to put it forward.” “Now I am not able to answer for the Deputy President, all I can say is that everybody is going to be subjected to a lifestyle audit right throughout to members of the executive. I will be subjected to a lifestyle audit and so will everyone else who serves on the cabinet,” adds President Ramaphosa.
