Firefighters union, Democratic Municipal and Allied Workers Union of South Africa (Demawusa) plans to sue Gauteng Premier David Makhura and MEC Jacob Mamabolo over the deadly Johannesburg fire. Three firefighters died after a massive blaze gutted part of the Bank of Lisbon building in the CBD. Demawusa, an affiliate of the South African Federation of Trade Unions (Saftu), says the Gauteng government admitted to knowing the building was non-compliant with health and safety standards, yet it left the firefighters go into the structure. Saftu General Secretary Zwelinzima Vavi says, “Our information is that they, as the government, have been sitting on this information for more than a year, and they have done absolutely nothing except to make headlines at the time when our comrades were trapped in a fire that should have been distinguished.” Click video below for for more:
