The SABC says although it’s in a difficult financial position, it has not made any decision on job cuts. Management at the public broadcaster held a meeting with staff earlier on Monday to present the corporation’s annual financial statement. Employees expressed concern about weekend reports that job cuts were looming at the SABC. However SABC spokesperson Neo Momodu says this is not on the table right now. “The SABC has not embarked on this process and that given our financial situation the CEO said that he has instructed his ex-members to start looking at various ways of cutting costs and he said if retrenchments become one such option the SABC is conscious of the legislative requirements that have to be followed before they embark on this process, including the relevant engagements with unions and staff members”.
