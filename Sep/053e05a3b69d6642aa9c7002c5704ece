A grade 12 learner from Modubatse Secondary School is expected to appear in the Bolobedu Magistrate’s Court on a charge of assault. Malepe Ramalepe allegedly assaulted and poured a bottle of water on the face of his female teacher. During his previous appearance, 18-year old Malepe Ramalepe elected to represent himself. The state told the court that they were still compiling a profile of Ramalepe. The alleged incident happened at the school premises after the teacher allegedly refused to return Ramalepe’s phone, which had been confiscated. Ramalepe has been in custody since his arrest last week.
