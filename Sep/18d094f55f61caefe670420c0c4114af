The African National Congress (ANC) National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting has paid a moving homage to their late comrade and Environmental Affairs Minister Edna Molewa. Paying his party’s tribute, President Cyril Ramaphosa described this NEC member as a hardworking internationalist. He remembered Molewa as a shining example who flew the South African flag with pride and great commitment. “I was rather surprised when I arrived in New York when I met African diplomats speaking so glowingly about Edna Molewa. She was an internationalist on environmental issues. This was articulated by a number of people from Europe and Asia. In her, we had someone who flew the SA flag and the African flag. To the ANC, this is more than a loss. We lost a dedicated hardworker,” says Ramaphosa . ANC Secretary General Ace Magashule says they thank all South Africans who extended a hand of support to the family. “On Saturday, this entire National Executive Committee will visit Molewa’s home in the capital city, to pay their respects to the family of the late Minister,” says Magashule.
