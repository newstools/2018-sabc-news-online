A 59 year-old woman from Dutywa in the Eastern Cape has made a plea for intervention. She says she is isolated from her community after being ostracised by a board of traditional leaders. She says the leaders shunned her after a disagreement over a piece of land in her yard. Nofinal Ntshinqeka’s life of misery, she says her problems started in 2015. This is when reigning board of traditional leaders told her to reduce her plot to make way for a neighbour and she refused. Since then, she alleges that she has been banned from community activities in Tyekelebende village, and locals do not come to her house, even when she hosts traditional functions. “As women we stay in our houses to keep everything together. I am very hurt; I have been everywhere seeking help even going to Bisho to look for help. I even asked Mama Nokuzola Mndende, she gave me advice but everything has been in vain.” The local board declined to comment, claiming the woman knows she contravened customary laws. The AmaXhosa Kingdom has asked Nofinal to lodge a complaint. Xhosa King Spokesperson Xolile Ndevu says:” She is part of that community, she is bound by the rules and regulations of that community. If the plot was demarcated in 1987 by a reigning chief then that decision is still relevant even now there is no ways that a current chief can amend that.” Until the matter is resolved, Nofinal continues to live a life of misery.
