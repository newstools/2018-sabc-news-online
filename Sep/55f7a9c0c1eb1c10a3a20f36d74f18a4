Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga has conveyed her condolences to the family of North West teacher Gadimang Mokolobate. Motshekga was briefing the media on last week’s meeting of the Council of Education Ministers in Pretoria. The minister also promised to visit the Mokolobate’s family later on Monday. “Mokobate just qualified as a teacher and started working in April, in less than six months his life was taken so easily,” She says. Mokolobate was stabbed to death allegedly by a 17-year-old learner on Thursday while he was invigilating grade 12 trial examinations. She also announced that the council has approved the extension of writing matric supplementary exams. Motshekga says from next year those who failed but still qualified for supplementary examinations will write in June instead of March. Click link for more
