The Democratic Alliance (DA) in the Western Cape is to seek details of the impact that former Social Development Minister, Bathabile Dlamini had in the province. This comes after the Constitutional Court last week ordered Dlamini to personally pay 20% of the legal costs of the court application by the Black Sash and Freedom Under Law (FUL) regarding the South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) grants payment debacle. The Chairperson of the Standing Committee on Community Development in the Western Cape legislature is the DA’s Lorraine Botha. She says they’ll approach the current minister for details. “This means the Minister could pay up to R1 million. I am currently in the process of writing to the of Social Development Minister Susan Shabangu, to ask what the impact of Minister Dlamini’s mismanagement in the Western Cape has been – and what steps she has taken to remedy these,” adds Botha.
