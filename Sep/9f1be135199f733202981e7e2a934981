Fees Must Fall Student activist Mcebo Dlamini is opting for the mediation route, hoping to get the public violence and assault charges against him could be dropped. Dlamini will make a fresh legal bid to the National Prosecutions Authority. He appeared in the Johannesburg Magistrates court on Monday morning where his case was postponed to the 17th of September. In August Dlamini walked to the Union Buildings in Pretoria in an attempt to get Presidential intervention in the court cases of students arrested during the protest. Dlamini faces several charges including theft, assault and public violence. These charges carry stiff prison sentences of up to 20 years if found guilty. He is looking to get an out of court mediation process started. Adding to this, a possible conflict in his exam schedule continues to cause further setbacks in settling on a court appointed trial date. “It’s now exam time but I am not in a position to say when the exams will start, we could only speculate but the court refused to allow this.” He will attempt mediation in the hopes of resolving the matter amicably. “Before we could even speak about trial date can we entertain the fact that we are making new representation to the NPA, to take the matter out of court, in a more conducive and healthy environment not at the threat of going to prison.” The case will resume on the 17th of September. This will be to set a trial date and an update on the possible mediation processes. Related video click below:
