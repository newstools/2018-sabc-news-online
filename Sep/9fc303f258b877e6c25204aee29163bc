Economic Freedom Fighters leader Julius Malema has condemned the attack and looting of shops owned by foreign nationals. He says the attack on foreign nationals undermines the effort of uniting Africans across the continent. Malema has described the attack on foreign nationals as self-hate. He was addressing over one thousand delegates attending the provincial elective conference in Limpopo. In August, Soweto and Ratanda residents embarked on a looting spree over claims that foreign-owned shops were selling expired goods. Two people were killed and one was critically wounded and was admitted to hospital, during the violence in Soweto. Twenty-seven people were arrested for various crimes including murder, attempted murder, possession of unlicensed firearms and public violence. Related video click below:
