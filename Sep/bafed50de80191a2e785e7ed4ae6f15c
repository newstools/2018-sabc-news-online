A 45-year-old woman who was shot in a robbery on the N-1 highway near Century City in Cape Town on Friday has succumbed to her injuries. The incident occurred on Friday when she stopped along the road when her motorcycle broke down on the busy highway just before peak time. Three suspects closed in on the deceased, and robbed her of her belongings before shooting her in the stomach. They then fled the scene. The woman died in hospital. Police spokesperson, Andre Traut, says their investigation then led them to Kensington where they arrested a 33-year-old man who was in possession of the victim’s personal items as well as a firearm. Traut says the other two suspects are still at large. The arrested suspect is expected to appear in the Cape Town Magistrate’s Court on a charge of murder on Monday.
