Former Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini could be prosecuted for possibly lying under Oath. The Constitutional Court on Thursday revealed that there’s strong evidence that suggests Dlamini was not truthful in her representation regarding her role in the social grants contract saga. The court ordered that Dlamini must personally pay 20% of legal costs of the application by civil society movements Black Sash and Freedom Under Law. An inquiry by Retired Judge president Bernard Ngoepe found that Dlamini withheld information regarding her role in the South Africa Social Security Agency (Sassa) matter. Justice Johan Froneman says the National Prosecuting Author (NPA) will now have to make a determination. “The inquiry support findings suggest very strongly that some of Minister Dlamin’s evidence under oath in her affidavits before this court and orally before the inquiry was false. The registrar of this court must be directed to forward the copy of the inquiry of the report and this judgment to the NDPP to consider whether Minister Dlamini lied under oath, and if so, whether she should be prosecuted for perjury,” says Froneman.
