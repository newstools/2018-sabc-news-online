The Swaziland Solidarity Network has urged President Cyril Ramaphosa to intervene in Friday’s elections in the neighbouring state, saying they won’t be free and fair. The candidates in Eswatini, previously known as Swaziland; have been selected by King Mswati the Third, who is described as Africa’s last absolute monarch. Swaziland Solidarity Network spokesperson, Lucky Lukhele, says many are boycotting the elections. “There is so much South Africa can do. Almost 80% of the economy is reliant on South Africa and SA can simply cay we are pulling the plug and things should be democratised. But it looks like it was put back by the previous administration of President Jacob Zuma. So, we hope this new leadership of Ramaphosa will do what is expected of them. There is nothing to vote for and we are very happy at the response by the people who have boycotted these elections. Aspiring MPs are told to promise people things that they themselves know they cannot deliver.”
