A lawyer and former politician, Dr Leon Wessels, says the late Constitutional Law expert, Professor Marinus Wiechers will be remembered for his selflessness. Wiechers who was Vice Chancellor at Unisa from 1994 to 1997 died from reported heart problems Friday night. He was born in 1937. Wessels says he was friends with Wiechers from the early 70’s. Wessels says: “He assisted me when I was doing my own post graduate studies and he really influenced me politically. He was keen to share experiences and to advise whoever called for his views. But I think the greatest contribution was he inspired a generation of young lawyers.” Former Unisa Vice-Chancellor Barney Pityana has also paid tribute to Wiechers. Pityana says those who knew Wiechers and worked with him knew him as an intellectual giant who was always humble and friendly. Wiechers is credited with writing South Africa’s interim Constitution in the early 1990s, and was known for his comments and analysis on issues like Constitutional Court rulings and the debate over use of the secret ballot in the National Assembly. Wiechers was also a noted artist who worked with canvas and ceramics.
