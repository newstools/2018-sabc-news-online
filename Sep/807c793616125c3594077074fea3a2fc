Police in the Southern Cape say thereâ€™s still no sign of a missing German tourist who disappeared at the weekend near Plettenberg Bay. 26-year-old Niels Frederik Szenbek booked into the Tsitsikamma Sunrise Caravan Park near the Crags last Friday. He was last seen on Saturday by the owner of the establishment. Police have launched a search for him. In April, 21-year-old Norwegian student, Marie Ostbo, went missing in Sedgefield, also on the Garden Route, after going for a walk on the beach. Police launched a massive air and sea search of the area but found no clue to her whereabouts. Her hat, shoes and cellphone were found on the beach.
