Proceedings at the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture have started in Parktown, Johannesburg  with representatives of banks testifying. On Monday, the commission heard evidence from Standard Bank general counsel, Ian Sinton. He gave a detailed account of how some ANC leaders and cabinet ministers tried to pressure the bank into reversing its decision to close accounts belonging to the Gupta family. Sinton said that he and standard bank CEO Sim Tshabalala were invited to a number of meetings following the bank’s decision to close the accounts.
