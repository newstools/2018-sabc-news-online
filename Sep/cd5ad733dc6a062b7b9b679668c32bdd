The Democratic Alliance’s (DA) Gauteng premier candidate Solly Msimanga has kicked off his election campaign in Alexandra Township, north of Johannesburg. He started the day interacting with ordinary members of the public and small business owners on the streets. The community raised concerns about poverty and poor service delivery in the area. Msimanga received a warm welcome from the community as he moved around the streets and from house to house to interact with residents. One of the key concerns raised by the community is high unemployment and drug abuse particularly amongst young people. The community also complained about high unemployment levels in the area. Some of the hawkers here have called on Msimanga to ensure that government provide them with stalls. Msimanga vowed to ensure that the issues raised are incorporated into the DA’s election manifesto ahead of next year’s general elections. Watch related video below
