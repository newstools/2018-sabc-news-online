The Motion of No-Confidence in the Executive Mayor of Tshwane, Solly Msimanga has been defeated in the council. Msimanga remains as Mayor with a significant margin. The African National Congress (ANC) brought the motion and was defeated with 95 votes against and 77 for it. The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) in the council however abstained from voting. “Honourable Councillors, the result of the vote of the motion are as follows, those that are for are 77, those against is 95 and those abstaining is 21,” said Speaker Katlego Mathebe. Msimanga says he is honoured and humbled to still serve the people of the capital. He says the ANC could not provide any evidence to substantiate their motion. “It only begins to expose the lack of ideas and originality and facts that they could use to bring the motion. But mine is not to focus on those. Mine is to make sure the people of the city are served, mine is to make sure the programs that we started,  we keep focusing on going forward.”
