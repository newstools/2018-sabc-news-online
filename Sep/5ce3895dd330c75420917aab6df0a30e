A team of emergency and fire rescue personnel have contained the fire that gutted the Pilanesberg Game reserve since Sunday in North West. Pilanesburg Game Reserve manager Johnson Maoka says reports suggest that someone from the Lekutung village was cleaning the yard and burnt the litter. Maoka says the fire spread to the mountain near the reserve. “Unfortunately due to strong winds and the winds changing direction, it was very difficult to contain the fire. It was burnt from the Lekutung village on the northern periphery of the reserve up to Kwa Maritane periphery of the reserve. Currently there is still some fire out there but it is not posing danger to the animals or the whole park to burn out”. Some of the animals are reported be trapped and running around for their lives.  The blazing fire has affected some property. The fire started on Sunday.
