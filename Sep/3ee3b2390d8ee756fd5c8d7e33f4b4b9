Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) MP Mkhuleko Hlengwa says he hopes government will heed the IFP’s call to suspend the fuel levy until the global fuel price have stabilised. Hlengwa says this is one of the recommendations which he will present when the National Assembly debates the high fuel price crisis on Wednesday. Hlengwa says he welcomes National Assembly Speaker Baleka Mbete’s decision to accede to the request to schedule the debate. “The debate is intended to find solutions to the current challenges facing South Africans, of the escalating fuel prices and therefore, this is the opportunity for the executive, in the main, and Parliament to present a relieve package to South Africans.” “Moreover, we are still committed to our call of the suspension of the fuel levy of R5,30 until such time that  the global prices of fuel have stabilised.” Related video click below:
