Mourners attending the funeral service of slain police officer Sboniso Buthelezi at Clermont, west of Durban have been moved to tears as police walked into the church carrying the coffin. Constable Buthelezi was killed while in the line of duty at the notorious KwaMashu hostel in the north of Durban last Friday. Buthelezi and a colleague were patrolling the hostel when they spotted two men running along the railway line. As they chased the suspects, the men fired at them, killing Buthelezi and wounding his colleague. Police Minister Bheki Cele and Acting KwaZulu-Natal Police Commissioner Nhlanhla Mkhwanazi have arrived to join the mourners. Meanwhile, police say two suspects in the death of police Constable Sboniso Buthelezi have been shot and killed at the notorious KwaMashu hostel, which has long had a high crime rate.
