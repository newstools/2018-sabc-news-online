The Ensemble political party led by Moise Katumbi, alliance of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) opposition parties, says they are optimistic the Southern African Development Community (SADC) member states will help resolve their political frustrations back home. The group, with the support of the DRC Diaspora in South Africa, has handed over memorandums of demands to the Angolan, Namibian and Zimbabwean embassies in Pretoria, seeking political intervention. They demand regional intervention in an attempt to force the DRC government to allow opposition leader, Katumbi to contest the December elections in that country. The DRC government has denied him registration to take part in the elections. The group’s Spokesperson Bruno Katumpa says they need support from SADC. “We want to engage SADC because there is an urgent need to pay attention to the crisis as the DRC government has failed to organise the election twice. And we don’t think that even later this year that will be done. So, we are concerned because it can degenerate into a big crisis and conflict, which is going to affect the entire region. So, to help in this crisis, we need SADC to be ‘implicated’.”
