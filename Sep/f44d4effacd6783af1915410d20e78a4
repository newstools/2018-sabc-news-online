The Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (Amcu) has been issued with strike certificates by the Commission for Conciliation Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA). The move follows a no resolution in the gold wage negotiations with gold producers Sibanye Stillwater and Harmony Gold. The unions’s demands include a R1 000 wage increase for the lower paid workers over the next three years. Amcu has already concluded a wage deal in the sector with AngloGold Ashanti. “Our members have moved from their position and agreed to an increase of R1000 each year and R100 living out allowance – in terms of Harmony and Sibanye maximum offer on a third year is sitting on R725 and R750 which is  below what the mandate is in terms of our members,” says Amcu National Treasurer, Jimmy Gama.
