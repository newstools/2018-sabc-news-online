Student activist Mcebo Dlamini is due back in the Johannesburg Magistrateâ€™s Court Monday morning. Dlamini faces charges including theft, malicious damage to property, assault and public violence emanating from incidents that took place during the 2016 FeesMustFall protests at Wits University. He has indicated that he will apply for mediation for the matter to be dealt with outside court. Last month Dlamini walked from Wits University to deliver a letter to the the Union Buildings in Pretoria in an attempt to get President Cyril Ramaphosa to intervene in court cases of students arrested during the FeesMustFall protests.
