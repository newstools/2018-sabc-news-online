Police minister Bheki Cele says the country’s murder statistics have increased. He’s presenting the crime statistics for 2017/2018 in Parliament. Last year’s stats showed that murders had increased to just below 19 000. Cele says the figure is now over 20 000. He says over 50 people are murdered in South Africa daily. “Crime stats in this financial year are nothing to write home about. It doesn’t matter what figures you put, but if you can’t deal and control the murder cases we are not bringing any joy to the SA people. “It looks like the figure this time, people are dying 57 a day. That’s how South Africans are murdered. It borders close to a war zone – when there is peace and no war in SA.” The minister is appearing before the Portfolio Committee on Police, and this will be followed by a media briefing. Cele took over as minister from Fikile Mbalula in February this year. The last crime statistics, released in October last year, showed that murders had increased by 1.8%.
