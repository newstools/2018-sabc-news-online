Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo who is the chairperson of the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture will only deliver judgment in applications for leave to cross-examine witnesses next week. On Thursday, Justice Zondo heard submissions from various implicated persons to cross- examine some of the witnesses. Justice Zondo says he will decide on whether to grant Ajay Gupta, Rajesh Gupta and Duduzane Zuma leave to cross examine witnesses by next week. He says: ” In regard to those, I reserve judgement. Once I am ready to hand down the decision, I will let everybody know.” Justice Zondo has since granted businessman Fana Hlongwane permission to cross examine former deputy finance minister Mcebisi Jonas, former President Jacob Zuma’s chief of staff Lakela Kaunda to question Vytjie Mentor and as well as Hawks official Mandla Mtholo to also cross examine Mentor. The commission is set to resume on Monday with the testimony of an official from Treasury. Related Video
