At least two people have been injuredÂ  after police fired rubber bullets outside the Sophiatown Police station, west of Johannesburg in an attempt to disperse protesting Westbury residents. The protest follows widespread community outrage after a mother was killed and her child critically injured on Thursday. They were caught in the crossfire of an alleged gang shootout. Meanwhile, an elderly woman has just been carried bleeding into the police station, past a burning tyre at the entrance. She was injured while police tried to disperse the crowd. Community members are accusing law enforcement of colluding with gangs and being more willing to shoot at community members than at criminals. Tensions are high and Main Road has been closed to traffic by law enforcement officials who are battling to bring the situation under control.
