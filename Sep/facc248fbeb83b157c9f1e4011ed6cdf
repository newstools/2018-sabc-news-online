A bio prospector specialising in the Baobab tree at the University of Limpopo’s Agro Food Technology unit, Patric Daswa, says Baobab trees which can survive for two thousand-500 years are dying out due to climate change. The Baobab has a potential to cure various ailments. The tree, which is mostly found the Vhembe and Mopani districts of Limpopo, can survive for up to two thousand-500 years. Daswa says the Baobab is part of the heritage of this country as it has been in existence for thousands of years. “The leafs of the Baobab plant are also eatable and they contain a lot of vitamin c, including potassium and calcium as well. Research has discovered that the crushed leafs of the Baobab plant has a potential of curing asthma, fatigue, insects bite, inflammation, kidney, bladder diseases, they also treat sores.” Daswa says the trees need to be preserved. “It is very important that we preserve those kinds of trees it has a huge role to play in sustaining communities, especially here in Africa, where we have got a plenty of Baobab plants. Research concluded that the depletion of the Baobab trees is because of climate change. Making this trees weaker, it makes them accessible to drought, diseases, fire and wind, so climate change is the main course of the death of this magnificent tree.”
