Energy Minister, Jeff Radebe, says government will absorb most of September’s fuel price increase. The price of petrol will rise by 5 cents a litre, to cater for the annual increase of petrol station staff. The country has witnessed substantial increases in the fuel price for the past few months. This is the sixth consecutive fuel hike this year. The price of petrol in Gauteng costs just under R3 more now compared to January. The department says this month’s slight increase is a once-off intervention aimed at providing some relief for motorists. The price was expected to go up between 23 and 25 cents per litre for September due to a higher oil price and a weakening rand. Related video click below:
