A man was rescued from the vessel on Saturday, according to a Reuters witness. Divers resumed their search inside the sunken ship after hearing signs of life. The man was rushed to hospital, his condition is unknown. Meanwhile, relatives stood by the shoreline, awaiting news of their loved ones. Among them some of the survivors. “The ferry overturned very fast and covered us. I was lucky that I was able to swim under water not knowing where I was swimming and I knew I was very near the ferry. As I was swimming to safety, I found a number of metal bars that cut my face and back of my head,” said the survivor, Charles. President John Magufuli has ordered the arrest of those responsible for the sinking. Some blame the accident on overcrowding. It’s believed the boat was carrying more than 300 people.
