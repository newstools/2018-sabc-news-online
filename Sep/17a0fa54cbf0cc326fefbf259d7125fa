The United Nations Women Executive Director, Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, says she will call for the acceleration of investment into various sectors in order for women’s lives to be changed. She was speaking ahead of Monday’s peace summit that’s due to be held in New York in former president, Nelson Mandela’s name. Meanwhile, President Cyril Ramaphosa is expected to unveil a Nelson Mandela statue in New York on Monday. The UN general debate would be preceded by the unveiling of the statue. “I am going to be talking about scaling up and acceleration because we are lagging behind. There are very important initiatives almost under every goal that are promising, scalable, that can make a difference.” “But the investment in these initiatives is not at the scale it should be, especially on the way it can make a difference to women and girls. So it is also calling for better and targeted investment so that we don’t leave anyone behind.”
