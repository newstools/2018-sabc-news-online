The Patriotic Alliance (PA) has withdrawn from the court case at the Port Elizabeth High Court, where the Democratic Alliance (DA) is challenging the legality of the council meeting that ousted former Nelson Mandela Bay Mayor, Athol Trollip. In a statement released by the party, they stated that they no longer think there are strong enough basis to challenge the council meeting. The coalition partners, DA, PA, Congress of People (COPE) and African Christian Democratic Party (ACDP), walked out of the council meeting where Trollip and chief whip Werner Senekal were ousted, two weeks ago, and saw United Democratic Movement’s (UDM) Mongameli Bobani being voted as mayor of the metro. Should the PA vote with the African National Congress (ANC), and UDM coalition, it will give them a majority in the council. Patriotic Alliance councillor, Marlon Daniels says no matter the outcome of the case, they will remain with those opposing the DA. “If the judge rules in favour of the DA, the PA took a decision that they will be in the opposition benches with the black caucus, should it happen.” In the court papers the DA wants the court to review and set aside the decision by the Provincial Cooperative Governance MEC Fikile Xasa to send one of the officials from his office, Jenny Roestorff, to preside over the election of new Speaker Buyelwa Mafaya, after City Manager Johann Mettler walked out of the meeting – saying there’s no quorum. The party argues that Xasa did not make any attempt to contact Mettler although he was around as the law prescribes. The party is also challenging Roestorff’s conduct in the process of appointing Mafaya as a Speaker. The DA says Roestorff only accepted oral nominations and ignored written nominations of which the party submitted the former Speaker’s name Jonathan Lawack. Watch related video below:
