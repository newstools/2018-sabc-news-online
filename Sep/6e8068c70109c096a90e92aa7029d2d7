The chief executive of South African telecoms firm MTN Group, Rob Shuter, said on Monday that he was confident that his firm would be able to resolve a multibillion-dollar dispute with Nigeria’s government. “Nigeria, it’s our largest market. We’ve been operating there since 2001. We do have some challenges these past few weeks, but we believe we will be able to make our case and I’m sure we will move past that as soon as we can,” Shuter told reporters at the ITU Telecom World conference in Durban. Nigeria’s central bank has ordered MTN’s Lagos-based unit to hand over $8.1 billion that it said was illegally sent abroad, while the government has separately handed MTN a $2 billion tax bill.
