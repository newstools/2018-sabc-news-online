The rain in Port Elizabeth has eased off, allowing affected residents to take stock. About 400 people were displaced and the city measured between 40 and 50 millimetres of rain since Friday. Inclement weather across the Eastern Cape saw certain areas record more than 200 millimetres of rain and snow in high lying areas. While the rain has brought needed relief to the drought stricken western half of the province, it has left a messy aftermath – with water everywhere. Busisiwe Joko returned to a drenched home: “My house was badly affected by the rain; if you can see inside everything is wet. We have no place to sleep.” Informal settlements in low lying areas were hardest hit. However the average level of dams supplying the metro is now at 30% with levels still expected to rise further as the inflow continues from catchment areas. Nelson Mandela Metro Mayor Mongameli Bobani says: “We are still saying to our people that don’t waste water, use water sparingly. We don’t know when the rain is coming after this particular one.” The mayor also promised that affected people will be moved out of flood prone areas and provided with housing. Click video below:
