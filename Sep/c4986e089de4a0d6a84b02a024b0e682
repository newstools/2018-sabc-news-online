Two Northern Cape teenagers have been arrested after the body of a 16-year-old boy was found with a bicycle chain around his neck. The boy was found by a passer-by last week behind the local cemetery at Pampierstad. Police spokesperson Sergio Kock says those arrested are about the same age as the victim. He says the teenagers are boys aged 15 and 16 year old. They are both charged with murder and will appear at the Pampierstad district court soon.
