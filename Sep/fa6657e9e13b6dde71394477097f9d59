Johannesburg police hope that ballistic tests on a recovered firearm will help in their manhunt for a gang involved in a fatal shootout in the upscale suburb of Rosebank on Friday. A security guard was shot dead while attempting to intervene in an armed robbery. The policeâ€™s Lungelo Dlamini says four suspects confronted a man walking near Oxford Road and, was robbed of his watch. Whilst that happened, the security guards responded and a shootout between the guards and the suspects ensued. One of the security guards was shot dead and a suspect was wounded but his accomplices managed to drag him and put him in the car and drove away from the scene. Police managed to recover an unlicensed firearm. Dlamini says they are busy following several leads to arrest the suspects.
