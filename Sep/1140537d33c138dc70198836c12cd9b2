The land reform has become the country’s fiercest political battleground ahead of the 2019 elections. At its December conference the governing African National Congress (ANC) resolved to expropriate land without compensation and so far parliamentary processes are in motion to ensure the realisation of this resolution. But this didn’t go unchallenged. On Tuesday in a leaked document to the media, former President Thabo Mbeki accused the ANC of abandoning its multiracial principles and becoming a black party due to its new land redistribution policy – a move that left the ANC seething with anger. Party Secretary General Ace Magashule has urged party members to respect decisions of their elective congress and that of the National Executive Committee (NEC). He was reacting to former President Thabo Mbeki’s take on the party’s resolution on land. Earlier Mbeki criticised the ANC resolution on the expropriation of land without compensation, saying it is not in sinc with the party’s long-standing tradition of non-racialism. However, Magashule says in as much as they respect their past leaders and stalwarts they also want them to respect conference resolutions and the decisions of the NEC.  Magashule also weighed in the International Criminal Court debate. Earlier this week International Relations Minister Lindiwe Sisulu said government is reviewing its earlier decision to withdraw from the ICC saying they want to effect reform from within, rather than leave. But Magashule says nothing has changed in relation to their conference resolution on the intention to leave the court in The Hague. Meanwhile the ANC Secretary General also handed over a revamped house to the mother of the late UDF activist Stompie Seipei. The fourteen year old boy was killed by the Mandela Football Club in 1989. The visibly happy Seipei’s mother Manniki also received a 1500 rand monthly grocery for the next three years. More reactions on former President Thabo Mbeki land comment:
