Three women suspected of being property hijackers have been arrested in Bellevue East near the Johannesburg CBD this weekend during a joint sting operation by police and City of Johannesburg officials. The city’s director of group forensic and investigation services, Lucky Sindane says the women have allegedly been sub-letting a building, unlawfully collected rent and denied the real owner access to the property since 2008. He says they will be charged under the Prevention of Illegal Evictions (PIE) Act, among others. Sindane says the property was hijacked more than 10 years ago and they are pleased it has finally been handed back to the rightful owner. He says: “This brings the total properties that are handed back to rightful owners to 29. These females will be appearing in the Hillbrow Magistrates Court where they will be charged for contravening Section 3 subsection 1 of the PIE act and they will also be charged for fraud.”
