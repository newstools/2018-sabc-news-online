Twelve people have been arrested in Klerksdorp in North West for public violence and possession of suspected stolen goods. Violence erupted early on Monday afternoon when local taxi operators clashed with foreign nationals in the area. It allegedly started after the body of a taxi operator was found lying in the CBD with stab wounds. A Zimbabwean national was also killed in subsequent clashes. Police spokesperson, Sabata Mokgwaabone, says they will continue to monitor the situation. “We cannot at this stage say that it’s xenophobic attacks. We are treating this thing as a separate incident. But we will also monitor it closely, doing that with the intention to make sure that we actually curb it before it gets worse. Twelve people are expected to appear before Klerksdorp Magistrate Court on charges of public violence and possession of suspected stolen goods. I must indicate that earlier on, we indicated that these people were arrested for murder, but the latest information indicates that they are not linked with a murder of a Zimbabwean foreign national.” Watch video below:
