Employment Relations Executive Luther Lebelo and suspended South African Revenue Service (Sars) Commissioner Tom Moyane ignored legal opinion which advised that they needed to give former Sars Deputy Commissioner Ivan Pillay a hearing before taking a decision to suspend him. Pillay was suspended for allegedly setting up a so-called “rogue unit” within the revenue service that was conducting investigations which were said to infringe on the intelligence service roll. Pillay took the matter to court and the court ruled in Pillay’s favour, saying that Sars should have given him sufficient time to respond. Pillay had submitted a 34-page document explaining the matters around that. However, suspended Sars Commissioner Tom Moyane elected not to read it. Lebelo is responding to questions by evidence leader, Advocate Carol Steinberg at the Sars Commission of Inquiry in Pretoria. Click below for more on the story:
