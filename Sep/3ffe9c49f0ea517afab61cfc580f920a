Chairperson of the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture, Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo is expected on Thursday to hand down judgment on his decision on applications for leave to cross-examine. Former President Jacob Zuma’s son Duduzane Zuma and two of the Gupta brothers had applied to cross exam some of the witnesses who implicated them in their evidence before the commission. Duduzane Zuma has asked the commission for permission to question former ANC MP Vytjie Mentor’s testimony, while Ajay Gupta wants to argue the evidence presented by Mentor as well as former GCIS head Themba Maseko. Both Ajay and Atul Gupta say they fear arrest in South Africa and will only testify via a video link from overseas. Zuma initially declined to appear before the commission, but has since agreed to testify.
