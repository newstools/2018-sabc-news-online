This is Ramaphosa’s inaugural attendance of the UN General Assembly session which will start on Tuesday and end on Thursday. A UN General Debate will be preceded by the unveiling of a statue of the late former president Nelson Mandela and the historic Nelson Mandela Peace Summit, a high-level plenary meeting in honour of Madiba who would have turned 100 this year.
