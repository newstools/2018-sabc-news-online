The whereabouts of ANC ward 20 Councillor, in Port Elizabeth, Bongo Nombiba, remain unknown as the police continue searching for him, to execute his warrant of arrest. Nombiba was convicted of fraud and money laundering, and was sentenced to five years in prison in April this year. He was granted bail while appealing the sentence and he lost his appeal bid twice. Nombiba was due to file papers petitioning the appeal in the Supreme Court of Appeal in Bloemfontein and the deadline was last Friday, that he missed. A warrant of arrest against him has been issued. Attempts to get hold of Nombiba were unsuccessful. Senior State Advocate in the Port Elizabeth Commercial Crimes Court, Wilhelm de Villiers says they haven’t located Nombiba. “Mr Nombiba had to file his papers petitioning to the Supreme Court of Appeals. He had to file those papers on Friday the 7th of September. He failed to file those papers. He is in breach of his bail conditions. A warrant was therefore issued for his arrest.”
