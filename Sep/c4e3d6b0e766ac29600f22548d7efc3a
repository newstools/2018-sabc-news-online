President Cyril Ramaphosa will visit Chatsworth south of Durban at the weekend as part of the Thuma Mina Campaign. Residents have expressed concern over previous cancellations by Ramaphosa. ANC secretary in KwaZulu-Natal, Mdumiseni Ntuli says Ramaphosa is serious about listening to the concerns raised by the Chatsworth community. President Ramaphosa will be leading a delegation of the national executive committee deployed to the province. Ntuli says part of what the president will do is to honour the commitment he made to come and have an extensive dialogue with the Indian community. Ntuli says the last time the President couldnâ€™t make it was because of an emergency meeting with his majesty the King of the Zulu kingdom.
