The Western Cape Agriculture Department has urged pet owners to remain calm about the canine distemper outbreak in the province. Close to 300 dogs in Knysna have already died or have had to be euthanised after contracting the virus.  The disease is highly contagious and it has now spread to the area along the Garden Route with cases already being reported in Cape Town. Symptoms include fever, vomiting and diarrhoea. Dogs that are not vaccinated are most at risk. “We have seen media reports about cases on the garden route and also in the Cape Town Metro. However, we do note that these have been recorded over quite a long period of time. So, there’s no need to panic. The disease isn’t a controlled one. The Department of Agriculture doesn’t vaccinate against it. The animal diseases act states that the owner is responsible for ensuring that their pet stays healthy which includes ensuring that dogs have all their vaccinations,” said Department Spokesperson, Bianca Capazorio.
