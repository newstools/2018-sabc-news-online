Acting Government Communication and Information System (GCIS) Head Phumla Williams is expected to continue her testimony at the State Capture Inquiry sitting in Parktown, Johannesburg, on Monday. Williams is the fifth witness to testify before the commission implicating her former boss, Mzwanele Manyi, in wrongdoing involving the Guptas. Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo has since instructed the counsel to prepare papers to summon Manyi to testify at the Commission. This comes after Williams testified that she received an sms from Manyi trying to influence her evidence on Friday. Williams says Manyi told her to say there were no New Age/SABC-Breakfasts organised by the Guptas during his tenure at the GCIS. Zondo said, “I would ask the legal team to prepare documentation for me that would enable me to take a decision on this or authorise the taking of some action whether its summoning Manyi, documentation that will include the text message that was sent.”
