Outgoing Parliamentary Advocate Mthuthuzeli Vanara says it would be premature for him to comment about looming retrenchments at the SABC. He’s about the join the public broadcaster, but says he is yet to be briefed about its financial situation. The SABC is in a financial crisis with expenditure exceeding the total revenue, resulting in a debt of about R1.3billion. Vanara is upbeat about joining the broadcaster. “It would appear that the Portfolio Committee which conducts oversight over among others the SABC is satisfied with the turnaround strategy. I have confidence in Parliament, I have full confidence in the board and the executive team within the SABC – that they will turn the situation around. If I had any doubt I would not be joining the SABC.” Vanara shot to prominance during Parliament’s ad hoc committee probe into the SABC. He acted as the evidence leader of the inquiry. Vanara was also instrumental in Parliament’s State Capture inquiry that was conducted by the oversight committee on Public Enterprises.
