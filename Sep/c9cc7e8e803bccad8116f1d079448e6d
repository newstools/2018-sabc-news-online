The detection of the oriental fruit fly in farms around the Orange River in Northern Cape has caused a scare to the provincial agriculture department. The fruit fly feasts on citrus and grapes, which the department maintains, are the main source of export in the province. When the fly finds its way into the fruit, it destroys it making it unsuitable for consumption. . Gert Cloete is one of the farmers owning a 68 hectares export grape farm. The 57-year-old farmer is worried about the outbreak of the oriental fruit fly in farms. “The flies lay their eggs under the skin of the grapes then it becomes unsuitable for export in general for human consumption so we need a little co-operation from all the farmers.” Provincial agriculture department spokesperson, Ali Diteme says if the fly, which was first detected in February, is not contained; it could impact on the economy. “The province is known to be one of the producers of grapes which is feeding to the wine and citrus industry. Now these flies are attacking those produce and as a result you will have a situation where you have your low quality harvest. At the end of the day you will have job losses. You are bound to have a serious crisis in the province.” African Farmers Association of South Africa representative, Sehularo Sehularo says the fruit fly affects their produce. “Our fear is, if it continues it will put farmers out of business and once they are out of business, employment rises. so we are really pleading with government to act as fast as it can.” The provincial agriculture department says it’s working together with the national department to contain the spread of the oriental fruit fly. It says inspectors remain on the ground.
