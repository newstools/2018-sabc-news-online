The Health Department has decided to close the Thelle Mogoerane Hospital’s contaminated neonatal and maternity wards and have moved all new born babies to the Nelson Mandela Children’s Hospital and Charlotte Maxeke Academic Hospital. This, following the Klebsiella outbreak in which 11 babies have been infected and six have died. Overcrowding was found to be the cause of this bacterial infection. Gauteng’s Health MEC Dr Gwen Ramakgopa says this is because the demand is higher, Gauteng needs more facilities to cope with numbers. She says however, they are taking extraordinary measures to ensure that they deal with underlying problems and the affected babies are getting the best care they can; some are starting to respond to the treatment and as the department they are monitoring the situation very closely.
