Ten have been killed in a crash on the N1 road outside Polokwane in Limpopo on Friday morning, after the bus they were travelling in overturned and landed on its side. The provincial Transport Department says details are still sketchy. Spokesperson Matome Moremi says: “At this point in time it is difficult to say how many fatalities but we can confirm that we have fatalities… we are not at liberty to tell, but indeed we must also indicate that the bus is not on the road, it is not disturbing traffic.” “We are calling on our motorists that as they pass by they should not stop because they will end up causing other accident,” adds Moremi.
