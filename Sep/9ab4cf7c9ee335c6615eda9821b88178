Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) have described Evironmental Affairs Minister, Edna Molewa as a hard-working public servant and commended her efforts as a minister. EFF National Communications Manager, Sixolise Gcilishe says Molewa was involved as a trade unionist and as a leader in the South African commercial Catering and Allied Workers Union. “We pay special condolences to the family, friends and the African National Congress (ANC). Mama Molewa was one of the hard-working ministers and a public servant with an impeccable struggle record. May her soul rest in perfect peace,” says Gcilishe. Gcilishe says Molewa was the first woman premier of the North West, “Something that must continue to inspire all of us in society to have confidence in woman leadership.” Meanwhile President Cyril Ramaphosa has announced that the late Minister is to be accorded an Official Funeral by the government. Molewa died earlier on Saturday after being admitted to a Gauteng hospital earlier in September. Watch related videos below
