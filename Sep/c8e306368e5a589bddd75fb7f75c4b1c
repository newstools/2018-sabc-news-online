The state has concluded its cross-examination on the second accused, Phillip Schutte, in the North West’s so called “sunflower case.” Schutte and co-accused Pieter Doorewaard are charged with killing 15-year-old Matlhomola Mosweu in Coligny last year. Matlhomola Mosweu’s death sparked violent protests in the area. Schutte told the court on his third and last day of cross examination, that he never met Bonakele Pakisi-the state witness, until the day the court conducted inspection in loco in Coligny. Pakisi testified that he saw Schutte throwing Mosweu off a moving bakkie. This after the two had caught Mosweu for allegedly stealing sunflowers. Judge Ronald Hendricks asked how many sunflowers had Schutte and co-accused Pieter Doorewaard recovered after catching Mosweu. Schutte said they were about five to six heads which could be valued at about R 70 each. The case has been postponed to 25th of September to allow both the state and defence to prepare their closing arguments. CLICK BELOW FOR MORE:
