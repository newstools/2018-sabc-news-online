Marine biologists and researchers are currently doing an autopsy on a Sperm Whale which washed up onto Swartvlei Beach near Sedgefield in the Southern Cape. The mammal’s body washed up on the beach on Friday. Initial estimates suggest it weighs around 30 tons. The dead animal has attracted a lot of attention as residents from the garden route drove out to the area to catch a glimpse of the whale. The waters around the whale is red with blood as researchers are taking samples from the animal. Researchers have already removed the animal’s unusual jaw, as its teeth are in demand by trophy hunters. Sanpark authorities say they will probably look at burying the whale in the next few days, after research work has been completed. At least three whales have washed out on the Southern Cape coastline this year.
