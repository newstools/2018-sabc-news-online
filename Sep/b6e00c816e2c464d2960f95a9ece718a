Tshwane Metro Council Speaker Katlego Mathebe has ruled that the vote on the Motion of No-Confidence in the Executive Mayor Solly Msimanga will not be conducted in secret. This comes after the African National Congress’s (ANC) request that the vote should be in secret because there is toxicity in the council and that Democratic Alliance (DA) caucus members will be vilified if they vote with the ANC. The DA denied this. Mathebe ruled that the vote will go ahead in public, but the ANC’s Mapiti Matsena said they would take the matter to court. “In this council, there is always been voting by open ballot, show of hands. Therefore, I rule that we will vote with open ballot, show of hands! That is my final ruling.” Matsena said, “Madam Speaker, we reserve our right and this is a matter that should be handled by the court so that we can follow that process in terms of your ruling.” Watch related video below:
