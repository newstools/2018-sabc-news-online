The Gauteng Pathology services says the more than two-weeks long strike at the Germiston mortuary, east of Johannesburg has ended. Earlier this month employees at the facility went on strike due to lack of protective gear and safety equipment. Workers from other mortuaries across Gauteng had to be called in to help deal with backlog. Acting Gauteng Pathology services CEO Mosou Morule says they have reached a settlement with the people who went on strike. He says the strike was based on complaints about the lack of adequate safety equipment and that has been addressed. “They were given the equipment and they are now fully back at work and at present the are no backlogs. The only backlog that could be there would not be due to the strike but due to the usual high numbers of bodies received at the Germiston government mortuary,” says Morule.
