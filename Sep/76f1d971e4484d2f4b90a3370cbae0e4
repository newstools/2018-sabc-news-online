The UDM’s Mongameli Bobani is to remain as Nelson Mandela Bay’s Executive Mayor. This after the Port Elizabeth High Court dismissed with costs the application filed by the DA and its coalition partners, Cope and the ACDP – challenging the legality of a council meeting that ousted former Mayor, Athol Trollip. The DA argued that the meeting did not have a quorum as DA councillor, Mbulelo Manyathi’s membership was terminated when he participated in the meeting. Manyathi abstained during voting – and led to the ousting of Speaker Jonathan Lawack. Bobani says the ruling is a victory for the people of the Metro. ” Everything that we have done was done according to the book of law. We knew that the DA didn’t have any chances of success. They knew that they didn’t have a case, even on the matter of Manyathi. “How can you fire a person in the middle of a council meeting? Therefore today’s victory is a victory for the residents. All our communities, black and white, are happy about his victory and we dare not disappoint them as we are going to provide them with the basic services they are hungry for,” Bobani says.
