The community of Mandalay on the Cape Flats plans to picket about high water bills in the area. Residents will on Saturday launch the Mayibuye iMandalay Mayibuye Campaign. The campaign is aimed at mobilising support in poor communities. “We will be joined by three communities Mandalay, Montclaire and Thembokwezi with representatives of the ratepayers association in Mandalay and Montclaire, as well as the neighbourhood watch. We have a challenge of the high water bills that we’re receiving from the City of Cape Town. They’re replacing water management devices,” said the campaign Spokesperson, Thumeka Mdlazi.
