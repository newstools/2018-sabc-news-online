The death toll from a cholera outbreak in Zimbabwe has risen to 25. The government has confirmed the figure as the World Health Organisation warns that the water-borne disease is spreading rapidly in the capital Harare. At least one of the deaths was recorded outside the capital, in the southeast district of Masvingo. Cholera outbreaks occur regularly in Zimbabweâ€™s cities where supplies of potable water and sanitation facilities are scarce. President Emmerson Mnangagwa has pledged to tackle the current outbreak. Earlier this week, authorities in Zimbabwe banned all public gatherings in order to control the spread of cholera.
