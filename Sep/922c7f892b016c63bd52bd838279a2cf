Violent protests have erupted in Reservoir Hills, west of Durban Tuesday morning. Ethekwini Metro police Inspector Sibusiso Nene says protesters are burning tyres and blockading Mountbatten Drive and Battersea Avenue. Inspector Nene has urged motorists to use alternate routes. Nene says: “Battersea road is blocked with burning tyres and barricaded with stones so when driving along Mountbatten Drive approaching Reservoir Hills drive cautiously as the situation is extremely volatile.” He says there were shots fired but no injuries have been reported. The protesters want their councillor to address them regarding service delivery.
