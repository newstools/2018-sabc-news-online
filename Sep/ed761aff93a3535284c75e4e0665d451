Businesses have been urged to invest in technology in an effort to combat crime targeting their operations. This was suggested at a panel discussion on how retail crime could be curbed. The discussion held in Sandton, north of Johannesburg was attended by Gauteng Community Safety MEC Sizakhele Nkosi Malobane, officials from the Police Service, as well as anti-crime activists. According to crime statistics, retail cash crime remains high, with at least 55 armed robberies and 195 burglaries at non-residential properties each day nationally. “We have the technology. We have solutions that have got a track record of over ten years now of mitigating against this kind of crime significantly reduces the opportunity to reduce cash lust within the retail stores. There is reluctance in the market to invest in this technology because there is still a squired perception that the automated cash management is more expensive than doing it the old way,” says Cash Connect Joint CEO, Richard Phillips.
