President Cyril Ramaphosa has authorised the Special Investigation Unit (SIU) to probe suspected wrongdoing within the Department of Water and Sanitation, Ekurhuleni and eThekwini Municipalities and the Media, Information and Communications Technologies Seta (MICT SETA). The investigation into the Department of Water and Sanitation will focus on the period between January 2015 and the present, a time when now Communications Minister Nomvula Mokonyane was at its helm.  The SIU will be looking at whether there was maladministration and unlawful expenditure in the procurement of IT services from software provider SAP SE (SAP). The investigation by the SIU into the  Ekurhuleni Municipality relates to alleged improper conduct by officials or contractors. This in procuring goods and services for the construction of the Vosloorus Hospital and Bluegum View Public Transport Facilities. The eThekwini Municipality’s tender for the supply of waste recycling bags is to be probed with regards to the MICT SETA undue benefit in the allocation of discretionary grant funding to a number of companies by officials and employees. The decision to carry out these investigations emit from a commitment made by the President during February’s State of the Nation Address (SONA) to purge public institutions of corruption.
