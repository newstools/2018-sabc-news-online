The attempted murder trial of ex-convict, Mark Scott-Crossley has been postponed to 22 November in the Lenyenye Magistrate’s Court in Tzaneen, Limpopo. Scott-Crossley allegedly knocked down Silence Mabunda in a street in Hoedspruit in 2016 in a suspected racial attack. The two had an altercation before Scott-Crossley allegedly smashed Mabunda’s cellphone and knocked him down with his car before driving over him, and hurling racial insults at him. The trial has continued for more than a year, and only one witness, the complainant, Silence Mabunda, has so far been cross examined. Scott-Crossely’s lawyer, Charl van Tonder has taken his time cross examining Mabunda repeating most questions. Magistrate Carol Honwana has complained about the line of questioning and the long period of time that the proceedings have focused on one witness. Over recent days van Tonder has concentrated on questioning Mabunda about the model of the car, its colour, and how he had been knocked down, allegedly by Scott-Crossley. Van Tonder repeatedly asked Mabunda how he was able to identify Scott-Crossley as the driver of the vehicle.
