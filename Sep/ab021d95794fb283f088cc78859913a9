Limpopo MEC for Transport Makoma Makhuruphetje has warned of high traffic volumes on the R71 linking Moria to the N1 Sunday afternoon. She says hundreds of buses and private vehicles parked at ZCC Moria headquarters will start to leave the church from around 2 o’clock. Speaking at a roadblock on the R71 in Polokwane, Makhuruphetje says the number of road fatalities in the area has fallen this year compared to this time last year. She says this year they managed to have to keep road users safe on the roads, road crashes and fatalities on R71 decreased dramatically. She says: “We have worked very well with people who were going to Moria, by last night all buses were in. Now everybody will be going back to Gauteng and our worry is the exit from Polokwane, but we have issued a statement to request all road users who are not coming from church to make sure before 14h00 they must have exited Polokwane. We are going to use the N1 and R101 as the exit.”
