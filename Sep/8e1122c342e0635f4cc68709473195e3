Johannesburg Emergency Management Services says investigations are underway to determine whether a charged hose-line was used by fire-fighters to fight a blaze which ripped through the Bank of Lisbon building on Wednesday. Three fire-fighters died in the fire, one of them after falling from the 23rd floor. The building houses the Departments of Health‚ Human Settlements‚ and Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs. Fire-fighters are continuing to battle the blaze. Johannesburg Emergency Services spokesperson, Robert Mulaudzi says they are working to ensure fire-fighters have enough equipment and vehicles. “We don’t have that information. It will form part of our investigation as to what happened on the incident. There is a shortage of vehicles, however we are doing something about it. In the last four months or so we have replaced about five fire engines with  new ones and two refurbished fire engines.”
