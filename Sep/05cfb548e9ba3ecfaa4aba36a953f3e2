President Cyril Ramaphosa has warned that the Fourth Industrial Revolution will fail if it remains in the hands of a selected few instead of being available to everyone. Ramaphosa was the keynote speaker at the ITU Telecom World conference and exhibition in Durban. Thousands of delegates from around the world are attending the conference. The new five generation of mobile telecommunications is expected to revolutionise life with connected appliances, including fridges, air conditioners and security systems becoming common. Ramaphosa says the benefits should be available to everyone including he poor. “Important to Africa and developing countries is the need for countries to share manufacturing and localisation opportunities to allow equal access and shared growth throughout the world. We say this so that some of these capabilities must not be the sole fiefdom of certain countries only,” he said.
