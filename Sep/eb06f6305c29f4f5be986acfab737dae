Striking nurses at several public clinics in Sedibeng in Gauteng’s Vaal Rand are yet to resume their duties. Nurses had downed tools on Thursday, demanding that the Gauteng Department of Health remove the District Director who is accused of nepotism. The Gauteng Health Department had obtained a court interdict forcing all striking nurses to return to work immediately. Trade union Denosa is in support of the strike, which is being coordinated by Nehawu. Denosa Regional Spokesperson Sabata Thekiso says a meeting to discuss resumption of duties is scheduled for Monday. “The agreement was that there would be a meeting on Monday to indicate whether we can be able to resume work or not. In terms of the interdict that has been issued, that interdict is outdated. That interdicted them on the previous strike. Most of the clinics are still closed because the clerks are not on duty, and security has closed the gates for protection of assets of the facilities. If things can go back to normal and our security can be ensured (sic) as necessary, we’ll most definitely be able to go to work.”
