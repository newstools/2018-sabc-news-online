ANC spokesperson, Pule Mabe has asked media houses in South Africa to report fairly on politicians who also have business interests. This follows a Mail & Guardian article earlier this year claiming Mabe was involved in corrupt activities amounting to millions of rands. The newspaper reported that Pule Mabe was implicated in a R49-million tender awarded to Mvest Trust in the North West. He was never criminally charged in the case. Mabe says media should exercise fair and balanced reporting in such cases.
