Gauteng Department of Community Safety says it is concerned about the high number of fatalities since the beginning of the long weekend. 26 people have died in the province. Departmental spokesperson, Ofentse Morwane has appealed to road users to obey the rules of the road. “Twenty six people including children have lost their lives on our roads. These fatalities are as a result of reckless and negligent driving. Driving under the influence of alcohol and unfortunately, we have the pedestrians who have been affected as well.” “We are expecting traffic to pick up later this afternoon as a lot people will be making their way back to Gauteng after a long weekend. We therefore appeal to all road users including pedestrians to be careful on our roads to avoid further loss of lives,” adds Morwane.
