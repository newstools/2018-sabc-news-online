Chairperson of the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture, Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo says if the members of the Gupta family implicated in state capture feel they will be arrested unlawfully, they can approach the courts on an urgent basis to seek remedy. Zondo was reacting after the Guptas’ legal representative, Mike Hellens, argued that the family fear they are fugitives from justice in South Africa, and will be arrested if they come to this country to testify.  Hellens says his clients believe the Hawks and police are recklessly incompetent and are a national embarrassment. The commission on Thursday heard applications by individuals who wish to cross-examine witnesses. In an affidavit, Hellens, representing Ajay Gupta, is applying before the Commission to cross examine witnesses including former ANC MP Vytjie Mentor and former GCIS head Themba Maseko. As the commission resumes, Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo has again called on the public to come forward with evidence. Zondo says he is heartened to hear that there are several high ranking members of the public service that are reported to want to give testimony. Watch below for more:
