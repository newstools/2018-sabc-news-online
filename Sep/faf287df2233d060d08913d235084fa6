Cross examination of Collen Rex the former Parktown Boys High water polo coach has resumed at the South Gauteng High Court sitting at the Palm Ridge Magistrates court in Ekhuruleni. The 22-year-old is facing more than 200 charges relating to the sexual abuse of minors at the school. Last month he pleaded guilty to 144 charges. Learners came forward after footage from a surveillance camera at the school hostel implicated the accused. State Prosecutor Arveena Persad is questioning Rex on the extent of force he used while wrestling with the learners. This after after two grade 8 learners testified that they passed out while wrestling with Rex. Rex however maintains the learners were fully aware of the sport and they knew that in a situation where they find themselves struggling to breathe they have to tap out and bring the game to an end. Persad went on to say that during these wrestling matches it was never intended to violate, hurt or kill any of the learners. Related Video
