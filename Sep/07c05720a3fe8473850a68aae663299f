KwaZulu-Natal police are still searching for those who killed an Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) leader in the province’s uThukela district of the Midlands in a drive-by shooting Saturday night. Zakhele Mazibuko – who was the IFP’s publicity secretary in the district – was ambushed as he was travelling between Estcourt and Ladysmith after a party meeting. Police say the attackers used high calibre rifles.  Police spokesperson – Thembeka Mbele – says the attackers shot at the BMW that Mazibuko was travelling in. “We are informed that two people, including this IFP member were coming from a meeting that was at Estcourt,  and while driving back along Ladysmith on the R74 towards Colenso, they were shot at by the occupants of a moving vehicle, which could not be identified at this time. One victim was fatally wounded and the other one sustained just injuries. At the moment the police are at an early stage of the investigation and there are no arrests that have been made.”
