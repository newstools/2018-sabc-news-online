The SARS Commission of Inquiry is expected to hear testimony from the former chairperson of the revenue service’s advisory board, former judge Frank Kroon on Friday. Kroon led an inquiry into suspended SARS Commissioner, Tom Moyane in 2015. On Thursday, it emerged that Employment Relations Group Executive, Luther Lebelo and suspended SARS Commissioner Tom Moyane ignored legal opinion advising against suspending former SARS Deputy commissioner Ivan Pillay before granting him a fair hearing. Pillay took the matter to court and the court ruled in his favour saying that SARS should have given him sufficient time to respond before suspending him. In 2015, Finance Minister Nhlanhla Nene set up the Kroon Committee when he felt that Moyane was too preoccupied with the rogue unit instead of tax collections.
