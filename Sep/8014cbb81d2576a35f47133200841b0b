A 17-year-old budding scientist from Flora Park Comprehensive High School in Polokwane is set to represent the country at the International Science Fair to be held in Johannesburg in October. Mosa Mupezeni created a project aimed at improving the taking off and landing of aircraft by replacing the runway track with a magnetic levitation system, as well as replacing wheels with hooks. This will help to reduce noise and pollution. The grade eleven learner says science has always fascinated him. “Actually it started when I was very young, when I was little. Actually I was interested in creating new things, inventions, solving problems. So each and everything that I see, let’s say it has a certain problem. I always want to find a certain problem to solve that particular thing by using technology mostly. From what I have experienced through the past competitions, I think I have a good chance of winning. From the comments, from other judges and other people,they gave me positive comments,” says Mupezeni. Mupezeni’s teacher and mentor, Isabel Sathekge is very proud of him. “I’m teaching him technical subjects, which is where he is actually getting all the ideas. He is a very good child. His performance is very good in class. We hoping for him to get even, I mean to get to the next level this year, because it has always been like a ladder each and every year. He started in grade 9, he got only the bronze in the regional. Last year he went for international, he competed and then he got the bronze in the international competition. So we really hoping for more this year,” she says.
