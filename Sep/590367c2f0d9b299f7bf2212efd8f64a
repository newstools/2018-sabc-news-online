A civic activist organisation, NotInMyName, is calling for harsher punishment of an alleged child rapist, accused of sexually assaulting a minor at a restaurant in Silverton, east of Pretoria last weekend. A 21-year-old man has since been arrested over the incident. NotInMyName activists say they have learnt that the accused is intending to plead insanity. NotInMyName spokesperson, Mo’ Senne, says they are urging authorities not to fall for the suspect’s latest desperate attempt to avoid facing the law. “It would be a travesty of justice if the law which was by the way formulated based on an oppressive system, goes lenient on him under any circumstances. So we can’t have leniency. We can’t let it slide because then what is it saying. What is it saying about people we keep calling the future of our nation?” However, the 21-year-old man appeared briefly in the Pretoria Magistrate’s Court and was remanded in custody until his next appearance on Tuesday next week.
