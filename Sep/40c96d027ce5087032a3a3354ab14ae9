The South African Municipal Workers Union (Samwu) says poor training and lack of resources are the two challenges facing firefighters in Johannesburg. Three firefighters died in a blaze in a government building in the city center on Wednesday. Samwu spokesperson Bafana Zungu says many of the firefighters are inadequately trained. He says trainee firefighters do not face fire in their colleges, they only do the theory. He says: “When they start working they experience real fire for the first time. The colleges are private, are they registered with the Department of Education and are they aware that they are only doing theory.” Meanwhile,  firefighters are continuing to battle the blaze. Johannesburg Emergency Services spokesperson, Robert Mulaudzi says they are working to ensure firefighters have enough equipment and vehicles.
