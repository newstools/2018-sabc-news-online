The South African Police Service (SAPS) briefs the Portfolio Committee on Police on matters relating to roles, responsibilities and safety of the National legislature. This comes after a parliamentary staff member Lennox Garane committed suicide inside parliament two weeks ago. The incident raised concerns about security levels in Parliament. National Police Commissioner Khehla Sitole and some police top brass were then requested to appear before parliament to explain the lack of proper security measures. Garane killed himself in his office at the National Assembly. He left a note headed “It’s a protest suicide,” explaining why he took his own life.
