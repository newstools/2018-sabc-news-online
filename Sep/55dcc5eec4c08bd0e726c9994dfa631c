African National Congress (ANC) Secretary General Ace Magashule says the late Minister of Environmental Affairs, Edna Molewa was one of the party’s giants, and that her contribution to the struggle of South Africans will not go unnoticed. Magashule was speaking on the side-lines of the ANC’s Free State Lekgotla in Bloemfontein. He says South Africans needs to follow in Molewa’s footsteps. “As the ANC, we want to pass our condolences to her family and South Africans. So, I think during this darkest hour, we want to say to all South Africans, the spear has fallen. It is time to pick up the spear and move forward to build a united and prosperous South Africa.” The South African Communist Party (SACP) has offered its condolences to Molewa’s family. It has urged South Africans to intensify environmental awareness efforts in memory of Molewa. “Sincere condolences to the family of Comrade Edna Molewa for the deeply saddening loss that they have encountered. She was one of the hardworking ministers in South Africa’s democratic dispensation. Her efforts contributed immensely to the success of the 17th Conference of the Parties, which was held in South Africa in November/December 2011. She was highly dedicated and outstandingly represented South Africa at the United Nations Convention on Climate Change,” says SACP National Spokesperson, Alex Mashilo. The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) described Molewa as a hardworking public servant and commended her efforts as a minister. “We pay special condolences to the family, friends and the ANC. Mama Molewa was one of the hardworking ministers and a public servant with an impeccable struggle record. May her soul rest in perfect peace,” says EFF National Communications Manager, Sixolise Gcilishe. Click below for more on the story:
