The rand has strengthened in early trade as a weaker dollar lifts investor appetite for riskier assets after United States President Donald Trump imposed an additional 10% tariffs on Chinese imports on Monday. Washington has already imposed tariffs on 50-billion-dollars’ worth of Chinese goods to force China to make changes to its technology transfer and high-tech industrial subsidy policies. Beijing hit back and discussions between the world’s two largest economies to settle their trade differences haven’t been successful. The rand is currently trading at R14,88 against the greenback.
