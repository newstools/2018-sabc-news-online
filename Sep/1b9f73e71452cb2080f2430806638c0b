Democratic Alliance (DA) chief whip, John Steenhuisen, says his party will lodge a complaint with the Registrar of Parliament’s Ethics committee, against deputy Minister of Correctional Services, Thabang Makwetla, for alleged conflict of interest. This follows newspaper reports that Makwetla and other members of the Executive have had security features installed at their homes. Bosasa, a facilities management company, has several contracts with government, including the Department of Correctional Services. Steenhuisen says these features weren’t reflected in Makwetla’s declaration of interest register. ” I’ve done an enquiry into 2013/14/15/16/17 declaration of interest and the installations have not been reflected, particularly the conflict of interest in this particular matter,” he said. Serious questions have to be asked why BOSASA has been generously throwing money and goodies around to ANC politicians and why, if it was all above board, these politicians like Vincent Smith and Thabang Makwetla failed to declare them? Doesn’t make sense…. — John Steenhuisen MP (@jsteenhuisen) September 9, 2018
