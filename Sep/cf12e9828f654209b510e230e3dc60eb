Parliament’s Communications Committee Chairperson Humphrey Maxegwana says one of the weaknesses in the current SABC Board is the lack of financial and human resources expertise. He says the committee will also be looking for such expertise as they short-list and interview candidates to fill the four vacancies. The Committee is expected to meet next Tuesday to discuss the turnaround strategy of the SABC and to shortlist about 12 candidates for the four vacant non executive board positions. Mxegwana says SABC issues are very urgent. He says: “We don’t have people who are clear experts on finances. Remember the chartered accountant that we had left and we need to be strong there so that finances of SABC are stable. We also want to reinforce the human resource side of this whole thing because if you are weak on those in any organisation or company, then you are perpetually weak.” Related Video
