Trade Union Federation, Cosatu has called on the ANC NEC to investigate reports of a plot to oust President Cyril Ramaphosa from office. The Sunday Times newspaper, reported at the weekend that ANC Secretary General, Ace Magashule, attended a secret meeting at a hotel in Durban last week, with former President Jacob Zuma, former North West Premier, Supra Mahumapelo, ANC Women’s League Secretary General Meokgo Matuba and KZN ANC Youth League Secretary Thanduxolo Sabelo allegedly plotting the removal of Ramaphosa. Magashule has since confirmed that he did met with Zuma and some ANC officials, but the meeting was to discuss certain issues and not to discuss plans to remove the President. Cosatu Spokesperson, Sizwe Pamla, says any threats of division within the party will weaken the alliance. “Look, we think it’s something that should be investigated, so that if the comrades are facing allegations are clean they themselves can be cleared. But also , the ANC needs to know because we have been here before, we do actually understand the impact of the divisions inside the ANC and those divisions will actually weaken the alliance.” Watch related video below:
