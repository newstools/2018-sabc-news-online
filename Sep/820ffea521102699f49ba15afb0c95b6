Angry commuters have expressed their frustration after they were left stranded at Cape Town Railway Station. This follows the cancellation of the train services to Simon’s Town after one of the carriages caught fire. Metrorail says the cause of the fires on three trains, within the space of three hours, on Friday afternoon at Fairgrove, Mbekweni and Cape Town Railway Stations is being investigated. Metrorail says commuters have been re-routed and no injuries have been reported. This is not the first time Metrorail trains have been set alight in the past few months. In July 2018, 32 train coaches were set on fire causing damage of more than R50 million. Commuter Vivian Smith says they fear for their safety. “It affects our people a lot, especially the old people. I go home at 8 o’clock in the evening. I stay in Muizenberg and it’s unfair, really. We pay our monthly fee and then we must get extra money for taxi fare.” Click below for more on the story:
