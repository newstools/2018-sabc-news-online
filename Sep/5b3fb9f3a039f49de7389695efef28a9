Tshwane Metro mayor Solly Msimanga has defended his statement that illegal immigrants are responsible for putting a strain on Gauteng’s resources. He says a joint investigation by the province and the National Council of Provinces has found that schools in Gauteng are battling to deal with foreign children while hospitals are also feeling the strain. Msimanga says it’s impossible for authorities to plan under such circumstances. “It becomes a huge problem for the province to plan. You find that a lot of people in the informal settlements are from Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Malawi, perhaps other countries as well. This makes it sometimes impossible for the province to plan what kind of services we provide.”
