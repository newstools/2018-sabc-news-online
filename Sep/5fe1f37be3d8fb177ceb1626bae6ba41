Chairperson of the Elections and Boundaries Commission in eSwatini, Gija Dlamini, says counting is almost complete at most polling stations following Friday’s elections. Dlamini says they have not received any formal complaints about alleged manipulation of the elections. This after six candidates raised concerns about a ballot box allegedly being tampered with at Siphofaneni just outside Manzini. “There has to be reports to the commission and the commission will investigate. That goes as far as the courts and we expect that to be done as soon as possible, as maybe before the end of the day so that counting can begin and be ended before the end of the day or the following day. We don’t want votes to oversleep in certain places where people will come back and say we don’t trust what happened to those votes,” says Dlamini. Watch related video below
