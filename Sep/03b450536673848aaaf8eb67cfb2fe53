African Aerospace and Defence Youth Development program Chairperson Kholisile Khumalo says the program has inspired young people to get into the scientific fields of Astronomy and Aeronautics. The program started in 2008 and is helping prepare South African youth for the fourth industrial revolution. Their efforts have seen a young female go as far as working for the American space agency, NASA. Khumalo says the program focuses on Grade 10 to matric. “We work with learners in Grade 10, 11 and 12. And we try to influence their career choice with regards to science, engineering technology and Aeronautics.” The program has produced aeronautics engineers and military vehicle technicians.
