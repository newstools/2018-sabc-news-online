Another person has died in gang-related violence in Boitumelong township in the troubled North West town of Bloemhof. The 15-year-old suspected gang member who was hospitalised after being severely assaulted on Thursday night, died in the early hours of Friday morning. Police spokesperson Amanda Funani has confirmed his death. This brings to two the total number of fatalities since violence erupted in the township earlier this week. Several other suspected gang members are in a critical condition in hospital. Residents and taxi operators have waged a war against suspected gangs. The area has at least five different gangs. Most public services including schooling have been disrupted in the township. Funani says: “We are investigating a case of murder and so far no arrests have been made.”
