The National Consumer Commission (NCC) says its campaign against non-compliance with food safety standards by small informal stores and manufacturers is starting to yield positive results. The NCC has embarked on a vast multi-pronged safety campaign to deal with allegations of fake and potentially harmful foods being sold to the public. This follows social media videos depicting items believed to be fake or with expiry dates as far back as 2015 being sold at foreign-owned shops. NCC spokesperson, Trevor Hattingh says the campaign will take place around the country. “We’ve already begun with the implementation of the strategy. Just yesterday we had an operation in Pretoria West to be specific where we closed three shops; because what was found there was that some of the products that they were manufacturing did not bear any country of origin. Markings on it as well as any best before markings on it. “So the company was closed and the operators were then instructed to comply within a certain period of time and we’ll be coming back to them to check whether or not they have then complied. And if compliance has still not been out in place on their side then further action will be taken against them.” “We will also be assessing the extent of non-compliance and the extent of the issues that has come to light on social media,” adds Hattingh.
