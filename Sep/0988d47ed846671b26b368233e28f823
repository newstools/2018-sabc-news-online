The High Court in Pretoria is expected to decide if a North West man on trial for murder is eligible for a medical break after he complained of a heart condition. 54-year-old Schalk Myburgh had been complaining of heart illness since the trial resumed on Monday. Earlier this year, the trial was adjourned for several months after the accused complained of stomach ache. Myburgh and his son, 30-year-old Myburg Junior are standing trial for murdering 62-year-old Reckson Mavula, a commercial farmer who was their neighbour at Kameeldrift outside Brits in 2015. They accused him of stealing a goat which turned out to be his.
