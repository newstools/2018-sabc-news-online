An Occupational Health and Safety Steering Committee has been set-up in Gauteng to ensure that all provincial departments comply with occupational health and safety standards. This comes in the wake of the devastating fire that gutted the Bank of Lisbon building in the Johannesburg CBD. Three firefighters were killed. The building which accommodated three Gauteng departments is one of seven government buildings in the city centre that do not comply with health and safety standards. The committee will be chaired by Gauteng Infrastructure Development MEC Jacob Mamabolo and all heads of the departments will be part of it. Gauteng government spokesperson Thabo Mabebe says: “Should the committee identify a building that does not comply, they have the right to go into that building and take appropriate steps which can include shutting down the building.” Meanwhile, the Johannesburg Emergency Management Services say areas in the burnt Bank of Lisbon building will continue to smoulder given the magnitude of the fire. A team of firefighters will be sent to the building to dumpen the smouldering areas of the building. Related Video
