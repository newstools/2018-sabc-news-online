Science and Technology Minister Mmamoloko Kubayi-Ngubane says that the protection, promotion, development and management of the Indigenous Knowledge Bill is one step away from being enacted. Kubayi-Ngubane was a keynote speaker at the 2018 Indigenous Knowledge Systems international three-day conference in Pretoria. The conference is attended by 250 local and international professionals, experts and researchers involved in using indigenous knowledge to improve the quality of life in rural communities. Kubayi-Ngubane says that the Indigenous Knowledge Bill is important in the preservation of indigenous knowledge systems and that the intention is to ensure that indigenous communities of the country are protected: “The Bill will provide South Africa and the region an opportunity to provide its indigenous knowledge and cultural heritage. The second strategic priority, as well as important provision in the IK Bill, is the development of the registration system that is referred to in clause 16 of the Bill for the collection, recording, documenting, storage management and dissemination of indigenous knowledge systems in communities across all nine of our provinces”.
