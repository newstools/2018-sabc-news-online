President Ramaphosa says South Africa will dedicate its tenure at the UNSC to continuing the legacy of Mandela. President #Ramaphosa: South Africa will take up a non-permanent seat on the UN Security Council from next year – December 2020. We will dedicate our tenure to continuing the legacy of Mandela, whose values of peace, reconciliation & respect continue to inspire Africa & the world — PresidencyZA (@PresidencyZA) September 24, 2018  The Council on Foreign Relations meetings convene government officials, global business leaders and prominent members of the intelligence and foreign-policy community from around the world to discuss international issues.  Ramaphosa says South Africa is determined to use every means at its disposal to advance the African Union’s Agenda 2063 and to consolidate regional integration. Earlier, speaking during the Nelson Mandela Peace summit at United Nations headquarters in New York, President Ramaphosa says world leaders can no longer ignore global challenges such as terrorism, transnational organised crime, illicit flows of finance and the growing number of refugees. He has challenged world leaders to play their part in ensuring that the UN is more responsive to global challenges. “The United Nations can only succeed to the degree that we, as global leaders, provide visionary leadership that transcends our ideological differences and narrow national interest. Through this Peace Summit, the current generation of global leadership is given an opportunity not only to reflect on peace in the world, but to take those measures necessary to end the wars that continue to take millions of innocent lives,” he said. The summit is part of the UN centenary commemoration of Mandela’s birth, and followed the unveiling of a statue donated by South Africa.
