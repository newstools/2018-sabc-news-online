There’s been a call for President Cyril Ramaphosa to axe former Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini from his cabinet over a Constitutional Court ruling that found her possibly guilty of perjury. The Constitutional Court (Concourt) on Thursday found Dlamini personally liable for 20% of the legal costs in the court case linked to the South Africa Social Security Agency (SASSA) grants debacle. Dlamini is currently Minister for Women in the Presidency. The Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) spokesperson on Social Development Liezel Van Der Merwe says the ConCourt judgement is an indictment on Parliament for failing to hold Dlamini to account over the grants issue. Van Der Merwe says, “I think the question now arises, what is President Cyril Ramaphosa going to do with a minister that the court said lied under oath and misled the court on numerous occasions in parliament around the Sassa debacle?” “She must act in haste to pay the money but also we would like to know from Ramaphosa what he will be doing against a minister currently occupying a position in his Cabinet?” added Van Der Merwe.
