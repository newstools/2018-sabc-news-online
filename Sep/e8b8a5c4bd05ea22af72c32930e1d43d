The African National Congress (ANC) in the Northern Cape has recalled its three proportional representation councillors at the Sol Plaatjie Municipality in Kimberley following a chaotic attempt by the council to elect a new mayor on Friday. The three councillors and eight ANC ward councillors who cannot be recalled attempted to vote with opposition parties. The election was eventually postponed. ANC provincial secretary Deshi Ngxanga says the councillors disobeyed party instructions. “Their conduct is unacceptable, and I want to emphasise that. No self respecting organisation will tolerate it’s own members turning against each other and defying decisions of the ANC. Stringent action will be taken, we will be harsh.” Meanwhile, opposition parties in the council have condemned the chaos in the chambers. The EFF, COPE and DA expressed the same view saying they are disappointed in the ANC in that they do not respect democratic processes. They say this shows a serious decline in basic governance and etiquette of conducting meetings.
