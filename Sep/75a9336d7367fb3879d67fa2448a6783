The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) has welcomed the sentence imposed on a Cape Town man who orchestrated a countrywide traffic licensing scam, saying it had a direct impact on road safety in the country. The kingpin, 33-year-old, Elton Abrahams from Belhar has been sentenced to five years imprisonment on charges of fraud and corruption. He appeared in the Bellville Regional court alongside his girlfriend, Bronwyn Davids and a former government employee, Laurelle Richards. They entered into a plea and sentencing agreement with the state. Abrahams issued clearance certificates for non-roadworthy vehicles. NPA spokesperson, Eric Ntabazalila says: “We welcome the sentence. It goes beyond the sentencing. It talks to road safety in that these people were part of a syndicate that was issuing these certificates fraudulently and some of these cars were trucks, buses and taxis which ended up on our roads and I’m sure it did result to some deaths on our roads.”
