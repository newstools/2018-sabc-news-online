The Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) in the North West has weighed in with its support for the disbandment of the African National Congress (ANC) Provincial Executive Committee (PEC) in the province. The union says this is long overdue. The governing party’s National Executive Committee announced the disbandment of the provincial committee in Cape Town on Friday. Former North West premier, Supra Mahumapelo was axed as provincial party chairperson. The current Premier, Job Mokgoro was announced as convenor of a Provincial Task Team (PTT), which will be set up and announced by the National Executive Committee (NEC) soon. Cosatu North West provincial secretary Job Dliso says they want to see a task team that is inclusive of the alliance partners. “But we will want to see a PTT which is not factional; we do not want to see any other group that will emerge because here the victory is for the ANC. The other thing that we want to see, is that all the alliance partners to be included to the PTT to make sure that all the issues raised by the community and the working class are being addressed by the current PTT,” adds Dliso.
