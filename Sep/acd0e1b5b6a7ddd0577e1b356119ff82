Colleagues of the three fire fighters who died in last week’s fire at the Bank of Lisbon building in the Johannesburg CBD have described how their efforts were compromised because there was no water to fight the blaze at the building. Simphiwe Moropana, Khathutshelo Muedi and Mduduzi Ndlovu were being remembered at a memorial service at the Ellis Park Arena in Doornfontein, Johannesburg. The men died while trying to put out the fire which started on the 23rd floor. A report has found that nine buildings, including the one where the fire fighters died, are only 21% safety compliant. One of the firefighters has blamed government for not ensuring that that building and others meet health and safety standards. Meanwhile, some Johannesburg fire fighters have complained that they do not have adequate fire fighting equipment, uniforms and that they do not receive danger allowances. A handful of them holding placards demonstrated before the wreath laying ceremony outside the Bank of Lisbon building earlier. Some of the deceased family members laid wreaths in front of the Bank’s building. Among those who attended the wreath laying ceremony were Johannesburg Mayor Herman Mashaba and Gauteng Human Settlements MEC Uhuru Moiloa. Click link for more
