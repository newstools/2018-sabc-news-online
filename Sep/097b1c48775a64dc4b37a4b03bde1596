Students at the North West University-Potchefstroom Campus, led by EFF Student Command and Sasco, are demanding that Afrikaans be eradicated as a medium of instruction at the institution. The university currently has Afrikaans classes with translation services available but the students are complaining about the quality of that service. Students marched and handed over their memorandum of demands to the university management. Sasco Chairperson Nhlanhla Mthethwa says, “We demand that English and only English be made the primary medium of instruction of the NWU Potchefstroom campus. In addition, we demand that the Vice Chancellor call an emergency council meeting within seven working days and finalise the language policy matter. Two, we demand that there must be an increase of 51% black African students admitted on the NWU Potchefstroom campus and in residences.” Responding on behalf of the university management, Executive Director for Students Affairs, Professor Lumkile Lelandle, says, “Within three days, which means that on Monday, this memorandum will be tabled in the university management committee by me. I would like to assure you that university management takes this issues that you have raised here seriously and they will apply their mind.”
