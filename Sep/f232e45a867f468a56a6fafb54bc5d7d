Justice Minister Michael Masutha has called on the International Association of Prosecutors (IAP) to equip its members, especially in African countries, with skills to successfully prosecute cases of illicit financial flows, human trafficking, terror funding and trading in protected species. Also to process repatriation of eroded resources back to the continent. This as South Africa takes stock of the effects of state capture on the economy. Masutha addressed more than 400 senior prosecutors, heads of prosecuting agencies and ministers of justice from around the world who are meeting in Johannesburg this week to exchange experiences on prosecutorial independence, including new developments, and legal challenges. “It is estimated that Africa loses over R50 billion dollars annually to criminal activities, which rob us of resources that would help our development efforts,” he says. “This is a criminal gain for the detriment of the continent and mostly poor people. This relates to money laundering and illicit trading,” he added.
