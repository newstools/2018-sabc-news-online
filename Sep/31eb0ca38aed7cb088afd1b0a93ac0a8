President Cyril Ramaphosa says he will testify before the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture, if he is called to give testimony. Ramaphosa was answering a question from DA MP Cathlene Labuschagne in the National Council of Provinces. He is having his oral reply session in the NCOP. Ramaphosa says no one should hide any information that can help the Inquiry. “As far as I am concerned, if the Zondo Commission asks me to appear before it, I have no difficulty, I have no opposition. I will go with a great deal of pleasure to go before the Zondo Commission, if the Zondo Commission says President come and appear. Because it is important that the people of South Africa get to know exactly what was happening in the state and to the extent that anyone of us has a story to tell, has something to put forward to the Zondo Commission, we should never hide. We should go forward. In fact as you cite the ANC part of if, it was the ANC that asked that a commission be set up.” For more watch videos below:
