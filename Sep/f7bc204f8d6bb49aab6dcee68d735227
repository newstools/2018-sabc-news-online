The legal team at the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture has submitted an application requesting three hard drives containing data known as the “Gupta Leaks” to be made part of the evidence by the commission’s next witness. The commission is set to hear the testimony of lawyer Brian Currin, who is set to shed more light on the Gupta leaked emails which made headlines last year, implicating public officials and the controversial Gupta family. The application has been brought forward by head of investigations Terrence Nombebe. Legal head Advocate Paul Pretorius says all three hard drives are currently in the possession of the commission for safe keeping.
