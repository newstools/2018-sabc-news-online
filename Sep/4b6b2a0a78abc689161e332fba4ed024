South Africans can expect very cold weather conditions across the country on Sunday. The South African Weather Service has warned of possible gale force winds and scattered showers. Madimetja Thema says, “We’re still having isolated or scattered showers over the eastern parts of the Eastern Cape, most of KwaZulu-Natal, the eastern parts of Mpumalanga and Limpopo.” “Some small falls still over the Drakensberg Mountains of Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal. We’re going to watch for gale force winds between East London and Maputo. Otherwise, the rest of the country will remain fine.” Meanwhile inclement weather across Eastern Cape has caused havoc in some parts, but the welcome rain also brought relief too many drought-stricken areas. The Lootsberg pass and the Wapadsberg pass in the Graaff Reinet area have been closed due to excessive snow. Localised flooding also affected more than 400 people in the Nelson Mandela Bay Metro, but the heavy rain in the Langkloof, where some areas recorded more than 200 millimetres is great news for the dams supplying the metro as this is the main catchment area.
