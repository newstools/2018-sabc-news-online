Former President Jacob Zuma says he will apply his mind to Justice Raymond Zondo’s invitation to submit an affidavit to the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture. Zuma was implicated by evidence presented by witnesses at the commission. The former president says he shall convey his reply to the chair as soon as he has consulted with his team. The statement was issued by the former president’s lawyers a short while ago. On Wednesday, the former president told students at the Walter Sisulu University that there was no such thing as state capture. Meanwhile, the Commission has been adjourned until Monday, when representatives from various banks will shed light on the closure of the Guptas’ bank accounts
