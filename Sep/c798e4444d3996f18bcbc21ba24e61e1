African National Congress (ANC) President, Cyril Ramaphosa, says that the country has not progressed as it should have in the last few years. He was delivering the Winnie Madikizela-Mandela Legacy Lecture at the City Hall in Johannesburg, Sunday evening. The ANC president says that the gains of the last decade have been reversed through state capture and corruption amongst other things. “The country has not progressed as it should have in the last few years. In fact the last decade has seen many of the gains of the early years of our democracy reversed through state capture and corruption, a failure of collective leadership, policy uncertainty and a growing distance between the people and their movement and their government. We have had to come to terms with the erosion of the values of the ANC and confront difficult questions about the quality and the integrity of our leadership as the African National Congress. As a movement we have acknowledged these weaknesses and are determined that we should learn from our mistakes.” President Ramaphosa adds that South Africa has a lot to learn from the late freedom fighter, Madikizela-Mandela. He says she was the voice of the voiceless and she continued to make sure that all citizens live a better life irrespective of their race or a certain background. President Ramaphosa says leaders of her magnitude are still needed in the country. –Additional reporting by Abongile Dumako  Watch President Ramaphosa’s full lecture below:
