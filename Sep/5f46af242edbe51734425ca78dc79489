Civil Rights group AfriForum and political party COPE, are planning to visit foreign embassies around the country to request the international community to help fight expropriation of land without compensation. They held a joint press briefing in Pretoria where they outlined their plans to stop government from amending the Constitution in order to implement land reform. COPE leader Mosiuoa Lekota says they’re taking this step because the ANC does not respect the Constitution. “We must try and get as many South Africans as possible who support the constitution to stand up and be heard – and say no. We want our constitution to remain in place, because it provides a foundation for correcting the wrongs of the past. Anything else that is generating tension among the people can only lead this country to war. We are already seeing how the economy is collapsing; infrastructure is falling apart because we have a government that is not concerned with the welfare of the people of South Africa”.
