Political analyst at the Tshwane University of Technology, Mashupye Maserumule, says political leaders should look into the framework of anti-apartheid activist, Steve Biko’s Black Consciousness Movement to help combat poverty, unemployment and inequality. Biko died while in the hands of apartheid-era police in September 1977. Maserumule says promoting unity among political parties could help address the recent economic challenges faced by the country. He says there are so much political formations and they are largely talking about the same thing. “So what is the point of being so divided? “I think Steve Biko’s Black Consciousness philosophy provided a framework of unity because it was a synthesis of all political efforts that sought to try and confront the apartheid system. So our political formations should start to realise that we are now confronted with challenges of poverty, unemployment and inequality. How can we work together to try to change the status quo.” The economy in recession, inflation rising, the rand-dollar exchanges and high fuel prices pose serious challenges for South Africa. This week, the government has called on its partners at NEDLAC to assist in restarting the economy to achieve inclusive growth. Deputy President David Mabuza addressing the NEDLAC annual summit in Pretoria, said it is on a platform like NEDLAC where solutions to the country’s socio-economic challenges can be crafted. Community partners say if youth unemployment is left unresolved, it will challenge the essence of education.
