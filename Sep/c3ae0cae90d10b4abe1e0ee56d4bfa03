The Beaufort West Municipality has appealed to South Africans to assist the Karoo town with water donations. The local Gamka dam, the main source of drinking water for 50 000 people, has been completely empty since October last year. Ten of the town’s 39 boreholes have run dry and reservoirs are at 17% capacity. Mayor Noel Constable says they are receiving assistance from the organisations Gift of the Givers and the Cape Town Water Warriors, but much more is needed. He says: “They already gave us 3 500 x 5 litre. So there is water in the store facility. We store it and when there is stoppages of water, where there is no water for the people, we supply them with five litres; 2 x five litres per household.” Related video
