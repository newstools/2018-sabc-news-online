An alleged member of the so-called O.R Tambo heist gang that followed unsuspecting people from the airport to their homes before robbing them of their belongings has been sentenced to 58-years in prison in the High Court in Johannesburg. Wanda Masilela was convicted of the murder of Johannesburg advocate Mandla Zulu who was killed during a hijacking incident in Bryanston,  north of Johannesburg in May last year.   Masilela and his gang hijacked Zulu and his wife  who were traveling in their Range Rover and as Zulu tried to reverse the car,  he was shot through the door. The robbers drove with the Zulus for a while before dropping them off in Lonehill. Zulu died in hospital from a gunshot wound. Masilela held his face and cried uncontrollably as the judge handed down the sentence. He later told SABC News that he’s innocent and he was never involved in the incident.
