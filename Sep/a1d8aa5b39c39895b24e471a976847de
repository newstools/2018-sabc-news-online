Eastern Cape Tourism and Environmental Affairs MEC Oscar Mabuyane say mining the sand dunes at the Wild Coast of Xolobeni in Mbizana is the way to go to change the lives of poor people in the area. Mabuyane says this will also contribute to the economic growth of the province “This mining will definitely change the face of the area, here we believe that if we are able to have these things, we will never have Mbizana again sending thousands of people in mines, we have lost R 13 billion over the last three years in our last equitable share because we have lost over 500 000 of our people who have gone to Johannesburg and Cape Town because they are looking for jobs.” Meanwhile, Amadiba Crisis Committee’s chairperson Nontle Mbuthuma says they will be looking to the courts to settle the matter.
