Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo has invited former President Jacob Zuma to give evidence to the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture. Zondo has asked Zuma, through his lawyers, to put his version of events where he has been implicated in evidence presented by witnesses at the commission, in an affidavit. Former African National Congress (ANC) MP Vytjie Mentor implicated Zuma, saying she attended a meeting at the Guptaâ€™s Saxonwold residence, where Zuma was also present. Former GCIS head, Themba Maseko also implicated the former President saying he asked Maseko to help the Gupta brothers. Justice Zondo says he has noted media reports of Zuma saying he is not implicated, but Zondo has since invited him to relay his version via his lawyer. Meanwhile, Justice Zondo has dismissed the applications brought forward by the Gupta brothers for leave to cross-examine witnesses. Proceedings have been adjourned until Monday.
