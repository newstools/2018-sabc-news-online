African National Congress (ANC) Secretary General Ace Magashule says he is prepared to appear before the Zondo Commission of Inquiry into State Capture should he be implicated.  Magashule was speaking in Bloemfontein, where he addressed Congress of South African Students (Cosas) learners on matters concerning education. The former Free State Premier and current ANC Secretary-General says he is ready to submit to the State Capture Commission. Magashule received a rousing welcome from Cosas learners. He told a packed lecture hall that he is not fazed by the criticism he faced for his meeting with former President Jacob Zuma few weeks ago. He says he will not be discouraged from meeting with the former president. “You see people are talking state capture I’m prepared to go to that commission, if I’m so implicated. I want to go there; I want to know because if one goes there one can actually relate many other stories.” Magashule repeated his complete denial of any plot to oust President Cyril Ramaphosa. “And let me tell you, nobody can stop me from meeting President Zuma. In fact I will even invite President Zuma to come and talk to you as students of Cosas.  I am not going to plot against anybody. There is no time to plot against the ANC leadership.” The lecture was attended by Cosas learners from all the districts in the province. Click below for more on the story:
