Two people have died in Syriaâ€™s Idlib province after being hit by Russian airstrikes. Russian President Vladimir Putin, who backs the Damascus regime, on Friday will meet the leaders of fellow ally Iran and rebel backer Turkey to determine the future of Idlib on the Turkish border. According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, Russian air raids targeted rebel positions in the south-west of the province.
