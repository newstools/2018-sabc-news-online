Former President Thabo Mbeki says as South Africa battles economic challenges and other issues, government can use past experience to resolve some of the current problems. He has called on all universities and colleges to teach students about the fourth industrial revolution. Mbeki says this is important for South Africa and the African continent to keep up with evolving technology across the globe. He was taking part in a discussion on the future of Education in Africa in Johannesburg. The Fourth industrial revolution was at the centre of discussion. Mbeki says the continent needs to keep up with the world and advance technologically. He says if universities and colleges take the first step it will be possible. Turning to the current challenges facing the country, the former President says the current South African government must look at how the African National Congress (ANC) led government dealt with economic challenges after 1994. He says the Thabo Mbeki library that is going to be build in Johannesburg will have the documents that can provide that information Mbeki says Africa has a potential to improve its quality of education and be part of the global community in advancing to the fourth industrial revolution. But a collective effort by Africans is needed to realise this phenomenon. WATCH BELOW:
