The African National Congress (ANC) has described as unfounded the allegations and calls by the Democratic Alliance (DA) for President Cyril Ramaphosa and the ANC to be called to testify before the State Capture Inquiry. This comes as the DA launched an online petition for South Africans to call on the ruling party and Ramaphosa to explain their alleged role in state capture. DA Chief Whip John Steenhuisen said the ANC is in denial that it allowed state capture to thrive for years during President Jacob Zuma’s term of office. ANC Spokesperson Pule Mabe has rejected Steenhuisen’s DA’s claims. “We have always stated, the ANC is not on trial. As a matter of fact we are the first organisation to call for a commission to look into issues of state capture.” “When the Zondo Commission started with its work, we were the first one to convey our message of support. What we have always said, because we have got comrade Zizi Kodwa who on behalf of the ANC spent a lot of time at the commission, so that we are also able to make comments on behalf of the ANC.” “The calls made by the DA are misplaced and unfounded, because we have always said we support the work of the commission and encouraged our members to participate where they could be able to assist in shedding some evidence or light in the work of the commission.” Related video click below:
