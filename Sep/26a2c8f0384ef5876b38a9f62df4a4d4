The Passenger Rail Agency‘s Interim CEO, Sibusiso Sithole, says recovery plans are being crafted to help better the organisation. This after management admitted that the organisation is struggling to survive, saying Prasa is in an ‘ICU’ state. The agency is to begin disciplinary proceedings against at least ten employees implicated in a number of reports including that of former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela’s 2015 derailed report. Prasa’s financials show a loss of nearly one-billion-rand in the 2016/17 financial year – up from 544-million-rand in 2015/16. Sithole says poor governance and corruption are largely to blame. He outlines PRASA’s plans for better train security. “In terms of our recovery plan there are things that we have to do within the next six months and three to five years. Safety is one of those that we need to prioritise. We are looking at new technology that could withstand the test in terms of vandalism and other isolated issues. We are looking into every train having security on board. We want to make sure that all our station precincts are provided with the necessary security so we can prevent vandalism and the burning of our trains.”
