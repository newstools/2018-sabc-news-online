Senior African National Congress (ANC) leaders have visited the home of late Environmental Affairs Minister Edna Molewa in Pretoria to pay their respects to her family. Molewa died at a Pretoria hospital at the weekend from a rare form of pneumonia. She was also the Chancellor of the Sefako Makgatho Health Sciences University in Ga-Rankuwa. President Cyril Ramaphosa confirmed that Molewa will receive an official funeral. ANC chairperson Gwede Mantashe says Molewa was a diligent leader. “I found her to be very intellectual in content, reading, understanding issues, persuade people by the force of argument and logic and not impose ideas on anybody. That’s why I am here today to pay my own tribute to the very strong and committed servant of the people and a comrade to me,” adds Mantashe. Click below for more….
