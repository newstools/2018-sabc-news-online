Nelson Mandela Bay City Manager Johann Mettler says he will be seeking legal advice after he was served with a notice of intention to suspend him. Mettler has been given seven days to make representation why he should not be suspended. He was served with the notice on Monday. Mettler and the current Executive Mayor Mongameli Bobani have been at loggerheads since Mettler resumed his duties as the Municipal Manager. Earlier this year, Bobani opened a case of misconduct against Mettler but Mettler was cleared of any wrong doing.
