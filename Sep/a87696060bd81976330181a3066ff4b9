The man accused of fatally shooting his teenage son after he mistook him for a robber is due back in the Lenasia Magistrate’s Court, south of Johannesburg, on Tuesday. Sibusiso Tshabalala is charged with the murder of his son Luyanda. Tshabalala shot his son as he tried to get into the car upon his return from an evening class at Fred Norman Secondary School in Ennerdale in June. He said that he fell asleep while waiting for Luyanda in the car and was startled and opened fire thinking he was being hijacked. When Tshabalala made his second appearance in court in July, the matter was postponed to today, to allow the state time to conclude its investigation into the matter. Tshablala has been out on a warning after the magistrate said that he submitted a plausible version during his bail application. He told the court in June that the incident would haunt him for the rest of his life. He spoke of how close he was to his teenage son, and that it would be very difficult to live without him. If the state is finished with its investigation, Tshabalala could find out today what will happen next. Click below for related video…
