Elderly people at KwaHlabisa in Northern KwaZulu-Natal say they live in fear of the youth. This follows an attack on an elderly person which went viral on social media. The video shows a young woman assaulting an elderly person with a stick. The victim is 70-year-old  Cabangile Ngcobo who now complains of body aches and says she is still traumatised. Ngcobo says the younger woman assaulted her because she was demanding her Sorghum beer back. She claims she had taken the beer on her way to school. “They took my drink in the morning while they were going to school and when they returned I told her that I was going to report her but little did I know that she was going to assault me.” Other elderly women living alone like Ngcobo in the area say they fear being attacked. The elderly want more police visibility.
