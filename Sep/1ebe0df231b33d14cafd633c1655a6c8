Foreign shops remain closed in Soweto, following days of violence and widespread looting this past week. Residents went on a rampage on Wednesday, accusing foreign shop owners of selling expired food. Ironically some looted the expired food. The unrest left four people dead and 27 arrested. Bellal Hossain, a Bangladesh national, is among the few brave enough to keep their shops open. He has been running his business for nine years and has been attacked four times. “At the moment we are also scared to do business nicely in this place because those people when you see them you can see how they are like an animal, the attacking is like that they attack us now, if it’s like that we are not going to stay in South Africa, we going to leave South Africa” With the shops closed residents are feeling the pinch, Sibusiso Zwane walked three kilometres to buy food. “It’s an inconvenience because we now have to walk long distances. I have walked all this way just to buy these three items. They were really helping us.” However for local businesses the closure means a spin-off in profits. Watch for more:
