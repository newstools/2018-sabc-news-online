Those bringing counterfeit goods into the country should be arrested, irrespective of who they are or where they come from. So says African National Congress (ANC) head of Elections, Fikile Mbalula. Mbalula addressed the media during his visit to the victims of the recent outbreak of violence in Soweto. The visit was also aimed at expressing condolences to those who lost their loves ones during protests when foreign shops were found to be selling fake and expired goods. The ANC head of elections says most local communities are subjected to challenges which include the selling of cheaper goods that is detrimental to the local economy. “Most of the people who are trading here are illegal, they don’t have papers to be trading and they have goods which are very cheap. The state must intervene and ensure that those who are doing that are being basically set aside and those with permission are allowed to trade.” Mbalula also called on communities to be responsible and to take it upon themselves to protect their own businesses and partake in the local economy. But he says there are challenges that government faces which include corruption. “If there is corruption and people have won tenders and they do not fulfill what they agreed to do in terms of been given the tender. As the ANC we must expose those who are corrupt and call on law enforcement agencies to act. Corruption is corruption it does not matter who you are. Those people who are doing these things must be arrested; those who are promoting corruption, doing business illegally must be arrested.” The ANC later met with local and foreign shop owners to look at ways of working within the ambit of the law.
