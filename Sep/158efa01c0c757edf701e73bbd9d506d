The double murder trial of a 61 year-old taxi owner in Mahikeng in the North West is expected to be heard in the Mahikeng High Court on Monday morning. Andrew Kube, the murder accused, was recently denied bail by the Molopo Magistrateâ€™s Court following two counts of murder, robbery with aggravating circumstances and possession of firearms and ammunition. Kube was arrested four months ago after being linked to the murder of chairperson of Mahikeng/Gaborone Taxi Association Kegopotse Tawana and his daughter Kelebogile. Tawana and her daughter Kelebogile were gunned down at their house in Magogoe Tar village in September three years ago in front of other family members. The suspect then fled the scene with a laptop, undisclosed amount of cash and a cellphone. Bobby Serame
