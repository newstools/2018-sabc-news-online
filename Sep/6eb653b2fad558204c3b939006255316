The newly-formed political party, the Mazibuye African Congress MAC has lambasted the African National Congress (ANC) leadership for removing its leaders such as former president Jacob Zuma, and former North West premier Supra Mahumapelo, in pursuit of capital gains. Speaking at a press conference in Marikana near Rustenburg in the North West, MAC president, Reggie Ngcobo, said such leaders were removed because they advocated for radical economic transformation. “Former president Zuma was removed in the same fashion in order to pave the way for imperial powers and is now subjected to all forms of vilification using the state apparatus. This venom is now trickling down to various government institutions and provinces. Comrade Supra Mahumapelo is subjected to such vilification for associating himself with the radical economic transformation. He is not a saint like many in the ANC but we believe his ill treatment is informed by anti-black agenda”.
