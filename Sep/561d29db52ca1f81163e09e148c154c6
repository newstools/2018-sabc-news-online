Former Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) Western Cape Secretary General Tony Ehrenreich says he stands by his comments despite a ruling by the Rights Commission which found him guilty of hate speech among other things. In 2014, Ehrenreich posted a Facebook comment, calling for revenge attacks against the Jewish Board of Deputies and what he called other ”Zionists supporters’’ in retaliation for the deaths of Palestinian civilians. Ehrenreich’s been directed to apologise in writing to the Board and affirm his commitment to constitutional values. But he’s instead called for engagement with the commission and the Jewish Board of Deputies. “The findings of the Human Rights board are important and it must be respected and I would happily want an engagement with them and the South African Jewish Board of Deputies. But I stand by my position. I will always condemn the atrocities of Zionists against the people of Gaza and I condemn the Jewish Board of Deputies for not speaking out against the violent violation of human rights by the Israeli Defence force by Gaza,” says Ehrenreich.
