Firefighters are closely monitoring the Bank of Lisbon building in the Johannesburg CBD to ensure that the fire doesn’t reignite. The fire which gutted several floors of the building was successfully extinguished late last night. Students residing at the nearby Waldorf building who were evacuated yesterday afternoon as a precaution have been allowed back into their rooms. The blaze which started on the building’s 23rd floor on Tuesday claimed the lives of three firefighters. Despite the fire having been extinguished late last night, firefighters are still lingering around the burnt building. They are not taking any chances and are monitoring the structure closely should there be any flare ups again. Dozens of fire-fighters are still fully geared up and on standby for any eventuality. This morning’s rain across Johannesburg could help flush away the debris from the burnt building which has accumulated around the structure. The roads around the building are also still closed with several fire engines, police and emergency services vehicles lining the streets.
