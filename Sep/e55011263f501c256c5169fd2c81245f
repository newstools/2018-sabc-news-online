Tshwane University of Technology (TUT) student who was recently shot,  Katlego Monareng was buried in Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga on Saturday. Monareng died after police allegedly fired live ammunition at students during a violent protest. It was a very emotional farewell for the young Monareng. Katlego’s family is finding it difficult to come to terms with his death. Sister Thandi Monareng says:”We are so broken. Katlego was a great person. He loved people, he loved his parents, loved my children, my children have lost an uncle and someone to motivate them.” TUT students want answers. SRC President Katlego Magobola says:”Katlego was a soldier he fought during the 2016 fees must fall protests. He died before he could even enjoy the fruit of his labour and we want the investigation completed soon and accountability from the police” The university has also instituted its own investigation into the matter. TUT Vice chancellor Stanley Mukhola says:”We are also as the university investigating the case. We understand the IPID came to the university on Friday and they are busy with their investigation and they have given us three weeks to complete the investigation.” The university vows that no stone will be left unturned as it probes the misfortune following the disputed SRC elections.
