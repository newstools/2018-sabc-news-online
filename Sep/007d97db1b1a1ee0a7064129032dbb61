Former Steinhoff CEO Markus Jooste is in Parliament to face tough questions on Wednesday morning. Jooste will have to explain what caused the crash of the company’s shares late in 2017.  Jooste was supposed to appear last month but the Western Cape High Court granted him an interdict to appear on Wednesday. It has been a long legal battle for Parliament to get Jooste to give details of what happened as the accounting officer. It is estimated that about R18 billion in funds belonging to the public service employees were lost when Steinhoff crashed last year. The joint committee meeting of Standing Committee on Public Accounts (Scopa), Finance, as well as Public Service and Administration is expected to grill Jooste about the events leading up to the collapse. Meanwhile former CFO Ben La Grange denied any wrong doing on this matter.
