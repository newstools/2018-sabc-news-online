The African National Congress (ANC) has send its condolences to the government of Tanzania following last week’s ferry disaster in which more than 200 people were killed. Party’s head of the International Relations Sub-Committee Lindiwe Zulu says the ANC hopes that the Tanzanian government will help the families of the victims to find closure. The ferry sank on Thursday in Lake Victoria with more than 300 people aboard. The government has declared four days of national mourning for the victims. Tanzanian authorities said on Sunday the number of people who died in a ferry that capsized in Lake Victoria had risen to 224 and the vessel’s managers had been detained for questioning. The definitive cause of the capsizing is not yet known but officials have said preliminary investigation shows the ferry was carrying more people than legally permitted.
