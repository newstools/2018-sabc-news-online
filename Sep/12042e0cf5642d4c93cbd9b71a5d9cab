The Department of International Relations and Co-operation (Dirco) says South Africans struggling to get hold of relatives in Indonesia, can contact them. Spokesperson, Ndivhuwo Mabaya, says to their knowledge, no South Africans have been caught up in the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia. South Africa has sent its condolences to the Southeast Asian nation following the disaster, which has claimed the lives of at least 408 people and injured at least 500. Hospitals are battling to cope with the influx of patients. Mabaya says, “we can confirm that no reports of any South African who has been injured or untraced in that area, but most importantly, we want to say to the people of Indonesia, we’re with them in this difficult time. And our mission will assist if there’s any need to assist.” Click for more:
