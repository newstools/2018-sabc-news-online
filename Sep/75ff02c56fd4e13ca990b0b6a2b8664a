The Democratic Alliance (DA) has reiterated that the Free State has been an epicentre of State Capture during Ace Magashule’s tenure as premier. The party has accused Magashule of improperly influencing the awarding of lucrative government tenders to his close confidantes. The party has compiled a 19-page dossier which has been handed to the Zondo Commission into State Capture. Free State DA leader Patricia Kopane says they’re ready to testify before the Commission. “We can reveal today that the last week we have received information indicating that the manner and the volume of awards to two companies by the provincial government must be questioned and must be investigated. Over the last years, both Sedtrade and Etsho have benefitted more of awards made by the provincial departments up to a point where it is possible that the majority of provincial contracts are now handled by these two companies.”
