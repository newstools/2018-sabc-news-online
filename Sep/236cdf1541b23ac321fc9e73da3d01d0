The African National Congress’s (ANC)  National Executive Committee (NEC) has visited the home of Environmental Affairs Minister Edna Molewa to pay tribute to the late politician. Members of other political parties made their way to Molewa’s home in Waterkloof Ridge in Pretoria. Molewa passed away last Saturday at the age of 61. Police Minister Bheki Cele says Molewa was not a push over. “One thing I remember very well about her was that she was not a push over at all. She stood her ground and wherever you put her, she was tops. We have lost great as ANC, as government but people of South Africa must really know they’ve lost a great leader.” Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi says the ANC NEC has come to thank Molewa’s family for allowing her to serve the country: “She has definitely run her race so we are going to thank them that you gave us your mother, you have given us your sister, you have given us your grandmother.  She had served the movement very well and we’ve come to say we are coming to release her to say she has run her race. She had really served with distinction.”
