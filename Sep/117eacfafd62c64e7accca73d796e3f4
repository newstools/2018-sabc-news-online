A massive veld fire that partially burnt three houses in Linksfield Ridge east of Johannnesburg has been put out. Johannesburg Emergency services say the occupants of the houses escaped unharmed. Investigations are underway to determine the cause of the blaze. Johannesburg EMS spokesperson Nana Radebe says the fire started as a veld fire but by the time they arrived three houses were affected. She says: ‘Only three houses were affected by the fire then we had to deal with the veld fire. It took about four to five hours for the fire to be completely out.”
