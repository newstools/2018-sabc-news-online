The third firefighter, who died in the Bank of Lisbon building fire in the Johannesburg CBD last week, is being laid to rest on Sunday. Hundreds of firefighters and community members are attending the funeral in Newcastle of one of the three firefighters who died during the Bank of Lisbon fire in Johannesburg last week. Mduduzi Ndlovu’s funeral service is under way at KwaMdakane, outside Newcastle, KwaZulu-Natal. Emergency Medical Service representative Robert Mulaudzi says Ndlovu dedicated his life to saving people and sacrificed his own when the building caught fire. He says Ndlovu has worked for the Emergency Services for more than a decade. A fire brigade funeral is being held for Ndlovu – an honour bestowed on firefighters who died in the line of duty. Speakers are moved to tears as they speak about Ndlovu’s endless love and kindness.   On Saturday Khathutshelo Meshack Muedi’s funeral took place at Dzwerani village outside Thohoyandou in Limpopo. The first to be buried was Simphiwe Moropana in Daveyton on Gauteng’s East Rand on Friday. The three lost their lives after battling the blaze that broke out on the 23rd floor of a building hosting three provincial government departments. The tragedy has again highlighted concerns over the shortage of resources for firefighters. But the Johannesburg Emergency Management Services (EMS) says it’s being addressed.
