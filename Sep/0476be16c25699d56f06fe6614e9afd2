The National Teachers Union (Natu) has called on government to stop violence in schools. The union says the problem has a potential of rendering the entire public schooling dysfunctional. The union wrapped up its three day elective conference at the University of Zululand in Empangeni, putting matters of education in the spot light. Natu members converged to consolidate their proposals and elect new leadership. The union says the current state of public schools needs urgent attention. It says violence at schools risks collapsing learning at schools. Last month two pupils from Masakhaneni high school in Kwa-Makhutha were stabbed to death inside school premises, the school was shut down for almost a week. The union also wants government to review teachers salaries. Thompson was elected president of the 100-year-old union while Mamiki Modiyane Maselwa is the new deputy president.
