Former President Jacob Zuma says he will meet with Higher Education Minister Naledi Pandor to discuss the issues facing students across the country. Zuma was speaking at Walter Sisulu University in Mthatha in the Eastern Cape where student leaders have addressed their issues with him. During his presidency, Zuma pioneered the initiative of free higher education for the poor. President Cyril Ramaphosa’s administration has implemented the no fees policy decided by the African National Congress late in 2017. Zuma says education is key to the future of young people. “I will meet the minister of higher education because it’s absolutely important, the issues that are raised on behalf of the students by your leadership should be attended to. This university is one of those that bear the name of one of the greatest leaders of our country and therefore I want to assure you that those matters will be attended to.”
