Mobile companies say they are being put under pressure to demand more spectrum from various governments and international regulatory bodies as the demand for data continues to increase. Telecommunication experts at the 2018 International Telecommunication Union (ITU) world conference say more and more consumes are migrating to future smart phones which demand 4 to 5G high frequency. Spectrum refers to the a range of radio waves that are used for communication purposes. This includes AM and FM. The waves can also be used for wireless forms of communication, high frequency travels a lot further and can pack more information.   African governments are demanding more spectrum and high frequency networks. As the world prepares for the World Radio Communication Conference in 2019, Africa says its allocated spectrum is not enough. They want theÂ  ITU, which regulates how much spectrum is allocated , to give the continent priority on high frequency connectivity. Government, civil society and the private sector says Africa urgently needs high frequency technology to eradicate poverty, increase economic activity and help fight the many humanitarian disasters it faces.
