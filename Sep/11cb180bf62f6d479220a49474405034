The driver of the bus that overturned and killed nine people on the N1 road outside Polokwane last week Thursday has appeared briefly in the Polokwane High Court on Tuesday. George Themba was arrested over the long weekend after he allegedly tried to flee the country into Zimbabwe, where the bus is said to have departed from Harare, destined for Gauteng. The bus overturned thirty kilometers outside Polokwane. The case was postponed to next Monday for the finalisation of his profile. Themba, is being represented by a defense attorney of his own, and will remain in custody until work is being done to compile his profile. He is expected to apply for bail after his profile has been presented in court.
