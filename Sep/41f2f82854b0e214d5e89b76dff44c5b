President Cyril Ramaphosa is expected to unveil a Nelson Mandela statue in New York on Monday. Ramaphosa will be leading a powerful South African delegation to this year’s United Nations General Assembly in the US. It’s his first visit to the UN as head of State – and is expected to outline SA’s domestic and foreign policy objectives – including the land reform programme and economic challenges. United Nations Deputy Secretary-General Amina J. Mohammed says, “I think that we would do justice to his memory by just reinforcing his legacy – one that stood at the centre of doing just by the smallest member of the family. So leaving those who are furthest behind is intolerable and we have to bring them to the front of the agenda.” “Now, we have a much more difficult context where we have to perhaps be closer together in order to challenge climate change, to face the challenges of conflict and look at things that look bright in the future – like technology. We have challenges that … we need to address together lest we leave people behind on that,” explains Mohammed.
