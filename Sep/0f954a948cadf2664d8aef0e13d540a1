Disgruntled African National Congress (ANC) members in the Free State have claimed that the current PEC is on a mission to destabilise the party and loot state resources. This comes less than seven months before national general elections. The dissatisfied members filed papers in the Bloemfontein High Court against the PEC that was elected in May this year. Spokesperson of the disgruntled group, Monnapule Ntamo says they have exhausted internal processes. “Even after the conference itself, we did make interaction to begin to show the NEC, including the current illegal PEC that they are not legally elected but all those efforts basically fell on deaf ears. We have taken note as well that the ANC national had taken a decision to approve the current PEC out of the faults and report that was submitted to the NEC by the secretary general and the crew that was deployed in the province.”
