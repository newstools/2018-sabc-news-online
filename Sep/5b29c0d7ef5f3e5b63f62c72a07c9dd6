The Commission of inquiry into State Capture has been postponed until next Thursday, due to the unavailability of former African National Congress (ANC) member of Parliament, Vytjie Mentor, and former deputy Finance minister Mcebisi Jonas. On Thursday the Commission’s chairperson, Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo dismissed former Public Enterprises minister Lynne Brown’s application to cross-examine Jonas. Zondo says the requirement to cross-examine a witness on an allegation is for the cross-examiner to present their version of events, which he said Brown failed to do. Head of the Commission of inquiry’s legal team Advocate Paul Pretorius says Minister Nene will testify on the 3rd of October, Minister Gordhan on the 10th of October and Barbara Hogan on the 15th of October. He says the difficulty that the legal team has had in planning for witnesses to testify this week and next week is that both Mr Jonas and Miss Mentor are out of the country and that has given some difficulties in programming in relation to their availability.
