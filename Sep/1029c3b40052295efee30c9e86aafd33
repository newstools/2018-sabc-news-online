The African National Congress’s (ANC) National Executive Committee (NEC) says it has finalised consultations with its lawyers to defend the party against members in the North West who intend challenging its decision to disband the Provincial Executive Committee (PEC) in court. This was announced on Sunday by NEC convenor in the North West Obed Bapela and other NEC members. They were introducing members of the newly-formed Provincial Task Team (PTT) to the branches in Klerksdorp. The event was snubbed by former provincial ANC Chairperson and Premier Supra Mahumapelo, who is part of the task team. Bapela referred to those taking the party to court, “It is said it’s three regions. But it is not the totality of the region; it could be individuals. They have written a letter to the SG, and we said give us reason. They are intending to take the matter to court, but we have also consulted with our lawyers and we are ready should they proceed with the decision. The ANC will be ready to defend itself.” When asked about the absence of Mahumapelo and other members of the now disbanded PEC who are also included in the newly-formed PTT Bapela expressed his disappointment. “I did not know why he is not here. I did not get any apology. I wish I had! There are quite number of number of others, including Fenny Gaolaolwe. As to why they are not here, I cannot speculate unfortunately.” Click link for more:
