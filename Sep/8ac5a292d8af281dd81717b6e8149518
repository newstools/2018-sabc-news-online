Traditional leaders organisation Congress of Traditional Leaders of South Africa (Contralesa) has condemned the killing of a teacher at Ramotshere Secondary School at Dinokana in North West. Learners and teachers could not control their emotions during the morning devotion session at the School. This is after the 24-year-old teacher from Ramatlabama village in Mahikeng, Gadimang Mokolobate, was stabbed to death allegedly by a 17-year-old learner on Thursday while he was invigilating grade 12 trial examinations. Mokoena has sent condolences to the family and colleagues of the teacher. “We want to condemn very strongly the incident where a teacher was knifed and pass on by a learner. The cause of all this I want to suspect as parents we have abdicated our responsibility let us go back to the roots and teach our kids respect, because any person who is your elder is your parent. I want to call upon all stake holders let us use whatever platform that we can have to encourage our youth to respect the elders. We are in charge of our own kids we want to say convey our condolences to the family of the late teacher,” says Mokoena. Concern about weapons in schools The Portfolio Committee on Basic Education is concerned about weapons at schools. Committee Chairperson, Ms Nomalungelo Gina, said this incident reinforced the need for greater safety and security measures at all schools. “The committee is deeply shocked by the incident. Weapons should never find their way into schools. This should be a safe environment for both learners and educators.”
