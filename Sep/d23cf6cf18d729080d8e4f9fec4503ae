North West Premier Job Mokgoro says he will instruct Social Development MEC Hoffman Galeng to intervene and help the grieving Mafoko family where possible. This after seven family members died in a shack fire at Senthumule informal settlement at Koster over the weekend. The fire is suspected to have been caused by a burning candle. Mokgoro has also sent his condolences. The Mafoko family wiped out in a tragic incident in the early hours of Saturday morning. The mother, four children, and two grandchildren aged 2 and 5 all died in the shocking blaze. Three family members who were not in the shack have survived. Neighbours say they were woken up by a heavy smoke, only to witness a painful death. Police have opened an inquest docket but do not suspect any foul play.
