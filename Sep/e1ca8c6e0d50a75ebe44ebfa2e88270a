President Cyril Ramaphosa has appointed a 10-man advisory panel on land reform. He made the announcement when he addressed the media at the Union Buildings in Pretoria where outlined his ambitious plan to help boost the ailing economy. The aim of the plan is to stimulate various sectors of the economy with the intention of creating more jobs. The plan is reported to cost the country about R45-billion. Government says it will be funded through the re-allocations of the existing budget. Meanwhile Economist Jeff Schultz says government resources are already constrained. “The devil is going to be in the detail… We are told that the stimulus package is going to be using existing fiscal resources, but I am skeptical on the ability of the National Treasury to be able to shift around much more on the expenditure side given that it has already made big shifts in the February budget. So my skepticism lies in ‘are we going try to do things better?’ I think that’s what the stimulus package is going to be directed at.”
