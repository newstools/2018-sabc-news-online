President Cyril Ramaphosa says his drive to drum up support for South Africa’s ailing economy has been warmly received by big business. He was speaking following several meetings with business leaders and would be investors in New York, accompanied by a high-level delegation from Pretoria. Ramaphosa also attended the UN General Assembly where he called for fair trade and economic practices. During his meetings with the business sector, the President persistently alleviated fears concerning the raging debate on land reform in the country. He says the country remains committed to ensuring that land reform is conducted within the law and in an orderly manner. “They understood that this was a huge historic injustice that was perpetrated upon the majority of our people.” “So I leave America fully confident that we have explained the processes that we are going through, we have explained the rationale behind the land question and we have also explained that the solution that we will come up with it is a solution that is aimed at promoting social cohesion, nation building.” Click video below:
