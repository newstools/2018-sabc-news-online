The Nelson Mandela Bay Executive Mayor, Mongameli Bobani says the High Court judgement is a victory for the residents of this municipality. The coalition government is made up of ANC, UDM, AIC with the voting support of EFF and Patriotic Alliance. Judge Elna Ravelas dismissed with cost the application of the DA challenging the ousting of Athol Trollip. Trollip was ousted in absentia in a rowdy council meeting last month with the DA arguing that the meeting was unlawful. Bobani says: “We have been saying that from the 27th of August this year, everything that happened in that council meeting was within the law. We’ve been saying there is one mayor, one Speaker and one Mayoral Committee. So today, the judge has confirmed everything we’ve been saying. Now we are joining hundred of thousands of Nelson Mandela Metropolitan residents in celebrating this huge victory.” Meanwhile Trollip says they will remain in the opposition benches and regroup. “We respect the judiciary, we knew we would get a judgment in our favour or against us. The judgement unfortunately went against us,” says Trollip.
