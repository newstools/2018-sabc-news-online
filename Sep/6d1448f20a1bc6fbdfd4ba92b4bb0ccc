Robbers made off with an undisclosed amount of money on Sunday morning in the latest cash in transit (CIT) heist. A cash van was blown up and robbed near Mahikeng in the North West. Nine vehicles surrounded the cash van forcing it to a standstill, and one of them bumped into its back, forcing it off the road. Shots were fired at the van and the back of the vehicle was bombed to get to the money. The cash-in-transit vehicle was completely destroyed. They managed to flee with the cash before setting one of their own vehicles, a Honda Civic, on fire, allegedly to destroy evidence. Nobody was injured in the incident. The CIT vehicle had been on its way to Itsoseng, reportedly to fill ATM’s with the cash. Shots were fired at the van’s tyres. The three CIT officials exited the van after which the robbers planted an explosive device on the armoured load bin. The robbers took the cash, leaving only R10 notes behind. The fire brigade and police responded to the incident. They found a bag with a suspected explosive device at the scene. National police spokesperson, Vish Naidoo, says, as with all CIT heists, several units will jointly investigate the incident. WATCH BELOW:
