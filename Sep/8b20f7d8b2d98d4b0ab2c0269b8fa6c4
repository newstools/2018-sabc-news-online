Zwane says firearms that were recovered from the vehicle of the suspects will be sent for a ballistic test. “When the police officers tried to stop the said vehicle, the suspects started to shoot towards the members and the members retaliated. As a result, three suspects who were in the vehicle were shot and killed. Firearms were recovered from the vehicle and we are going to open a case of attempted murder as well as possession of unlicensed firearms and ammunition.”
