National Student Financial Aid Scheme has called on prospective tertiary students who are social grant beneficiaries to apply for the government bursary scheme. The organisation has an agreement with the Department of Social Development to waiver proof of income as an application requirement for social grant beneficiaries. Applications for financial aid are open until November 30. The organisation has faced challenges in 2018, including complaints from students of non-payment of fees at various institutions of higher learning. NSFAS Administrator, Dr Randall Carolissen says students from households with an annual combined income of up to R350 000 are also encouraged to apply. “All prospective students who are currently receiving or have previously received any of the social grants automatically qualify for NSAFS funding.” “Students who are funded and have received payments from NSFAS for 2018 studies and will be continuing with the existing qualifications in 2019 are not required to reapply for 2019 funding.
