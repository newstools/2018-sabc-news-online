America should not be allowed to control Africa, and Africans should not fight each other. This is according to the Free State ANC provincial executive committee member, Thembeni Nxangisa. He was delivering the Kofi Annan memorial lecture in Bloemfontein. Annan died in August in Switzerland at the age of 80 after a short illness. Annan has been described as the man who proudly represented Africa as a whole. He was the first black African to head the UN and was awarded the Nobel Prize for his contribution. Nxangisa says Africa should be like Kofi Annan who stood for peace against all odds. He says America should not be allowed to control Africa. Ghana bid farewell to former U.N. Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, on ThursdayÂ  in a state funeral attended by African leaders and international statesmen, who hailed his record as an advocate for humanity and world peace.
