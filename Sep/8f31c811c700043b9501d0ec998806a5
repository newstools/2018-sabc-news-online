Former President Jacob Zuma has avoided the topic of an alleged plot by himself, African National Congress (ANC) Secretary General Ace Magashule and others to oust President Cyril Ramaphosa. Zuma was delivering a free education lecture at the Walter Sisulu University in Mthatha in the Eastern Cape. The former President touched on many issues including colonisation, and the nationalisation of the banks and mines – saying they are reflected in the Freedom Charter. Zuma also claimed State Capture did not exist – because there was no evidence the entire state had been captured. The former President  says the South African state has not been captured. Zuma says the judiciary, the legislature and the executive are not captured. “We have a commission that is sitting investigating the state capture… is the state captured? My view, and I am not disagreeing with anyone… these are political decorated expressions, absolutely… there is no state that is captured; even when people try to describe it when giving evidence, there are some people who were doing things with others individually, not a single of the three is captured.” At the end of the lecture Zuma challenged students to challenge the current political status quo, even asking “what is state capture?” Watch related video below:
