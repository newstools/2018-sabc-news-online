Parliament’s presiding officers will take up the matter of security inside the Parliamentary precinct after an official allegedly shot himself dead inside one of the offices in the 90 Plein Street Building on Friday. Many are asking how a firearm was brought into a National Key Point and the ANC caucus has asked for an investigation into this aspect. Cape Town police have so far opened an inquest docket. Parliamentary spokesperson Moloto Mothapo says security issues need to be addressed when police are investigating. “It is not something that is desirable. It’s a life of one of the staff members that is involved here. The whole institution is highly traumatized, the close colleagues as well as the rest of the staff. Members of the institution are affected a lot by this. It is noted that the presiding officers will have to address with the SA police as they are investigating to ensure that something of this nature does not recur.”
