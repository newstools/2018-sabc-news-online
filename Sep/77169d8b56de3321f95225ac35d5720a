The Hawks have nabbed six people believed to be key members of a rhino poaching syndicate in Mpumalanga. Members of the Hawks and SARS officials confiscated properties belonging to some of the suspects. Properties belonging to those implicated in massive trafficking of poached rhino horns were raided. Goods such as furniture, suspected stolen items, electronic equipment, an undisclosed amount of cash and vehicles were confiscated. The seized items are worth millions of rands. Hawks Spokesperson Hangwani Mulaudzi says:”It’s an operation that started in January last year and we have worked with SARS and crime intelligence to catch people we believe belong to a rhino poaching syndicate. We have seized property; there is still a lot to be done because we found that some of the suspects owe SARS millions.” The suspects appeared in court, with the focus being on the two men alleged to be leaders of the syndicate. One of them is 53 three year old Sydney Mabuza, known as Mshengu and 33 year old Joseph Nyalungu, known as Big Joe. The Hawks believe they’ve got a strong case, and more arrests are imminent. The case was postponed to the 27th of September for bail application. Click video below:
