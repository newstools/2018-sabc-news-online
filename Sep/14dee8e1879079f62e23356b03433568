The situation is calm in Westbury, Johannesburg on Saturday morning, following Friday’s violent protests. Scores of angry residents took to the streets barricading roads and burning tyres in protests against gangsterism and other social ills. The protest was sparked by a shooting incident on Thursday, which claimed a woman’s life, and left a child in a critical condition. A few people, including an elderly woman, were injured when police fired rubber bullets to disperse the crowd. Johannesburg Metro Police spokesperson Wayne Minnaar says, “The situation in Westbury is calm today following violent protests there since the killing of a female who was a passer-by and injuring of a child.” “At least 200 JMPD officers were deployed there last night to monitor the situation and will continue to monitor the area over the weekend. All roads there have been reopened, however there’s still debris there on the sides and on corners, but the traffic flow in Westbury has returned to normal,” adds Minnaar.
