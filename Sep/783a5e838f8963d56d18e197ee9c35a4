Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba is expected to announce a number of amendments to South Africa’s visa regulations on Tuesday. The Department of Home Affairs says Gigaba will hold a media briefing on the matter in Pretoria. This follows President Cyril Ramaphosa’s announcement of changes to the visa regime as part of the economic stimulus and recovery plan that he unveiled last week. Ramaphosa said that within the next few months, amendments would be made to regulations on the travel of children and the list of countries requiring visas to enter South Africa. Some of the country’s visa requirements are said to have affected tourism in recent years.
