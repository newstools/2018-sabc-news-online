The Democratic Alliance (DA) wants the SABC to broadcast the Zondo Commission of inquiry into State Capture live on its television and radio platforms. The party says it has written to SABC board chairperson Bongumusa Makhathini requesting that the commission be aired live on its terrestrial platforms. DA spokesperson on Public Enterprises Natasha Mazzone says the majority of South Africans are currently getting only mediated coverage of this crucial Commission. She says at present, only those with access to satellite television and internet connections that allow for streaming are able to watch live feeds of the Zondo Commission. "South Africans will pay the price for the damage State Capture has done to our economy. The SABC must therefore broadcast the Commission on its terrestrial channels as the public deserve to know what happened and who is responsible." – @Natasha9Mazzone — Democratic Alliance (@Our_DA) September 30, 2018
