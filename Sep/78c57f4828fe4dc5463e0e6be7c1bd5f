United States president Donald Trump has taken a tough stance against the United Nation’s rights and justice bodies – accusing them of being subjective. Trump was addressing the United Nations General Assembly in New York. He also announced tough new measures against Venezuela as well as China. Trump was greeted with laughter at the beginning of his speech as he boasted about his administration’s accomplishments. He then went straight to real issues, amongst them, the status of the Human Rights Council, accusing it of shielding human rights violations while bashing America and its allies. “We withdrew from the Human Right Council and we will not return until real reforms are enacted.” Trump also took a swipe at the International criminal court accusing it of selective justice “We will never surrender America’s sovereignty to unelected, unaccountable global bureaucracy.” Additional tariffs have been imposed on Chinese goods as part of the on-going trade wars. Despite a harsh tackle on the UN rights and justice bodies, Trump reiterated America’s commitment to global peace and prosperity. Click video below:
