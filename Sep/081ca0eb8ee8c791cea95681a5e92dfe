Acting Fire Chief in the City of Johannesburg Arthur Mqwa thanked Moropana’s family for allowing the 28-year-old to join the city’s emergency services department. “When he first donned our uniform, it was a very happy moment. He’ll be remembered at the City of Johannesburg and the country as a whole. He died a hero. Something that is not highlighted in the media is that he saved 1150 employees of that building. He led from the front as great leaders do, as he always did, and very tragically, he made made the ultimate sacrifice. Rest in peace.” Watch video below:
