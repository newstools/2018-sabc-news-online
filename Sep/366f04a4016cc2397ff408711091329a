Four Regional Executive Committees of the ANC in the North West have written to the party’s Secretary General, Ace Magashule saying the disbandment of the Provincial Executive Committee is unlawful. In a letter written on behalf of the four regions, they are accusing the National Executive Committee of deviating from the Constitution of the ANC. The NEC disbanded the PEC late in late in August – something that has raised eyebrows with the PEC saying the decision is underpinned by several material irregularities. The North West was placed under administration in May after public unrest over the leadership of former premier, Supra Mahumapelo. Acting Premier Job Mokgoro was appointed to lead the province, as well as the new task team appointed last week. The four regions: Ngaka Modiri Molema, Bojanala, Doctor Kenneth Kaunda and Doctor Ruth Mompati, claim that they were not consulted before the NEC took its decision to disband the PEC. These regions also claim the NEC of the ANC has not consulted with them before taking the decision, nor has it given them time to participate in electing the new PEC. Now these four regions of the North West say they will be consulting with their branches and call for an early Provincial Conference.
