Despite trade unions and other formations calling the eSwatini electoral system undemocratic, voters came out in their numbers to cast their ballots. They are calling for a system that will allow parties for better service delivery. The Elections and Boundaries Commission insists the Tinkhundla voting system is free and fair. Eighty seven year old Boshiwe Mkhonta has voted for several years. Mkhonta has not lost hope that one day there will be a change in eSwatini. “We want the country to move forward and that is why we keep voting. We hope for wisdom.” PUDEMO leader Mario Masuku calls the on-going elections in the Kingdom of Eswatini a process of selecting people for parliament. “We have seen that in parliament you have no power they cannot pass a vote of no confidence on any cabinet minister because those MPS work for the king. The king passes all bills irrespective of what parliament says. So we regard that as a waste of time. It does not help the people.” The Elections & Boundaries (EBC) insists the electoral process is free and fair. EBC Spokesperson Mbonisi Bhembe says: “The elections and boundaries commission came out clear that every person who registers, does that freely and there is no benefits attached to registration. We then hope that the public will have that confidence in the process. No one is compelled to go to the elections.” The election results are expected out tomorrow.
