Residents in Mitchells Plain, Cape Town, say they have had enough of the crime in the area. Around 200 residents held a peaceful candle-lit vigil Friday night in protest against the rampant gangsterism and drug abuse in the area. One resident, Washiela Harris, says they held the vigil to show authorities that the lives of the people in Mitchells Plain do matter. He says: “Not a week goes by without killings within Mitchells Plain and we have had enough. We want the law to know that our lives matter, our kids’ lives matter and this is just us showing visibility within the community and just making our presence felt.” Another resident, Enrico Simmers had equally strong views. “I’m not going to be a victim in my own community. I’m sorry, I won’t stand for that. So I think it’s about time as a community that we came out because support is out there but people fear for their lives,” says Simmers. Religious leaders at Lentegeur in Mitchells Plain have called on residents in the area to come together and take a stand against gangsterism and crime.
