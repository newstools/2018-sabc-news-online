The Democratic Alliance says the appointment of Dumisani Hlophe as the broadcaster’s new Political Editor, is “deeply puzzling and worrying.” On Friday Hlophe was given the position of Politics Editor for News and Current Affairs at the public broadcaster. The DA has  lambasted the decision, saying Hlophe has no experience as a journalist. However, the SABC says Hlophe’s appointment will consolidate its position as an independent and impartial broadcaster. He is due to begin work in the new position on Monday “There are many talented, practising journalists in South Africa that the SABC could have chosen from and would’ve been a far better choice. Mister Hlophe simply does not inspire confidence. He is, in fact, bad news for the SABC. We hope that Mister Hlophe will prove our misgivings about him wrong” says the DA’s Phumzile van Damme.
