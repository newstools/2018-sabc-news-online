Teachers have a big role to play in the upbringing and shaping someone’s life. But what happens when the same teachers are accused of violating the human rights of learners by exposing them to harmful behaviour that involves sexual assaults and violent school initiation programmes. Gender Activist, Mbuyiselo Botha says, the culture of silence in Park Town Boys High School in Johannesburg continues because of shame and stigma of speaking out. “If you speak out, you will be punished. The punishment does not have to be physical, you will be ostracised.” Parktown Boys School Governing Bodies Chairman, Jim Pooley says the school is horrified by what happened. Pooley says they firstly became aware of assault incidents in November 2016. “As soon as we became aware of the incidents we acted on them.” Last week, the Department of Gauteng Education released its findings into the alleged assaults that have been going on for years at the Parktown Boys High School. Some of the findings revealed that one of the learners who had been the subject of assault at the school, ended up taking his own life. Also that 33 boys are currently receiving counselling and 6 are on suicide watch. Click link for full interview: Part 2 of the discussion:
