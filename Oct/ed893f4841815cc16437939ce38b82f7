Residents of Ennerdale, south of Johannesburg have started to converge on the streets blockading roads with burning tyres. This after the Gauteng shutdown co-ordinating committee called on residents of the so-called coloured areas to embark on total a shutdown to draw President Cyril Ramaphosa’s attention to their plight. It says 10 so-called coloured communities across Gauteng will embark on total shutdowns Organisers say police will not deter them from turning to the streets to protest against what they terms social exclusion. One of the residents says they are tired of empty promises. “Empty promises, empty promises its what we get but when it comes to elections they want votes. Then they will come to the people saying we will build houses. I am telling you now I don’t blame those at soccer city for land grabbing. Our people are sleeping on top of each other. We do not condone land grabbing but give our people proper houses, why must a foreigner come and stay in a RDP house.” Traffic has been badly affected on the busy R557 road in Ennerdaleand it has been blocked off to traffic. Motorists heading to Johannesburg are being forced to use alternative routes. Johannesburg metro police are maintaining a strong presence.
