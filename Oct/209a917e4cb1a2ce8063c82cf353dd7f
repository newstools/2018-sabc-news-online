Parliament’s Portfolio Committee on Public Enterprises responsible for the Eskom Inquiry held a meeting to finalise the process of the inquiry before it is adopted on Wednesday. The Chairperson of the committee Zukiswa Rantho said the reason the committee decided to discuss the first draft off camera was to protect the implicated persons in the report before it can be made public. Rantho said as the committee they want to correct certain errors contained in the interim report and give those implicated an opportunity to comment. “We have not furnished the interim report. There are few other cosmetic errors that we have done in the report, so therefore we are going back to correct them. And after that if we are given a chance by the chairperson of the committee to deal with it within the committee time…then we will adopt it. From there we will take it and send it to the implicated people,” says Rantho.
