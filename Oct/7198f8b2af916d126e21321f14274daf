The strike by members of the National Education Health and Allied Workers’ Union (Nehawu) at the South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) is over. Nehawu, Sassa and Social Development Minister Susan Shabangu have reached an agreement to end the strike. The parties also announced this week, following a meeting, that the Biometric Enrolment of grant beneficiaries would be suspended. Sassa workers affiliated to Nehawu embarked on a national strike action on Wednesday calling for the suspension of the biometric enrollment of beneficiaries. Nehawu Spokesperson Khaya Xaba says,”What this means is that workers can return to work on Monday. We are monitoring as Nehawu to ensure that beneficiaries are paid on time and are paid the right amount. We are happy with the effects of the strike and want to applaud our members for their resilience and discipline during the strike.” Click link below for more on the story:
