President Cyril Ramaphosa has welcomed the progress the G20 Africa Summit has made in line with its commitments last year. The summit launched the Compact with Africa initiative last year. It is expected to drive investors in Germany to invest more on the African continent. Various Africa heads of states are attending the summit in Berlin, where business has pledged its support for investment in Africa. Germany and South Africa continue to enjoy good trade relations. German companies have a major strong hold in the country as they employ more than 100 000 South Africans. Ramaphosa has also thanked other African countries who have shown key interest in the initiative. Mbali Thethani
