One of the lawyers representing three of the suspects in the Westbury murder of Bradley Sauls has withdrawn from the case. The other lawyer did not show up at the Johannesburg Magistrate’s Court on Thursday morning. The nine suspects, including two Sophiatown police, are facing murder charges. Sauls was killed in an alleged revenge hit in July. There was strict security in court with only a handful of relatives and community members allowed inside. The nine suspects face various charges for Sauls’s murder. The 21 year was allegedly kidnapped and later shot. Sophiatown officers Wynand Steyn and Tom Keet have also been charged with kidnapping and murder. They are accused of tampering with the crime scene and concealing crucial evidence. The 21-year-old Sauls was gunned down while walking in Westbury on July 24th. A date for the bail hearing will be set on Tuesday for the accused. Related video click below:
