President Cyril Ramaphosa has called on South Africans to honour Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu by developing what he called,- a Doctrine of Peace. In the proposed doctrine, Ramaphosa says peace should include justice and fairness, equality, respecting human rights of every human being and silencing the guns of war. The President was the main speaker at the 8th Desmond Tutu International Peace Lecture in Cape Town last night. The President said, “Let us continue building the unity of our nation, conscience always of the fact that there will be no peace without equality and no reconciliation without justice. I want to conclude by suggesting that in honour of the outstanding work that Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu has contributed in raising our consciousness as a people and as a nation about peace,  we should develop a doctrine of peace that should guide us so that we can acquire and give full meaning to what peace should mean in our own country and indeed in the world.” Full Lecture below:
