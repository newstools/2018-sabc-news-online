Independent political analyst, Professor Keith Gottschalk, says Cape Town Mayor Patricia de Lille’s career is over within the Democratic Alliance. A full council of the City of Cape Town is set to discuss an independent report by law firm Bowman Gilfillan on Thursday, recommending disciplinary action against De Lille. A leaked two-thousand page report allegedly found that De Lille failed to report tender corruption. Gottschalk says there’s also a second report by another firm that allegedly found differently. He says, “Newspapers have given accounts on the contradictory reports, so we’ll have to wait and see what they spell out in full when they finally come out into the public arena, but it’s clear that whatever happens Patricia de Lille’s carreer is over in the DA, and these are really minor skirmishes.” Meanwhile, De Lille says she’ll respond later Wednesday regarding the independent investigation. De Lille says she’s still studying the report and will issue a statement later.
