International Relations Minister Lindiwe Sisulu has defended the appearance of the Nelson Mandela Statue gifted to the United Nations last week. A social media storm has since erupted over the likeness of the statue; with many airing views that the bronze was not a fair reflection of the country’s first democratically elected leader.   The statue was created by Andre Prinsloo and Ruhan Jansen van Vuuren – the very same sculptors responsible for the 9 metre bronze of Madiba at the Union Buildings in Pretoria. Sisulu says she loves the statue and says people will get used to it. “It’s the same sculptor who did the one that stands in the Union Building and it is the same gesture to the world that says ‘I’m at peace with the world, be at peace with each other’ – almost like a father figure extending his hands and the message that he conveys in himself more. We approved it, it is Mandela, it is the best sculptor we have in South Africa. He is the one that the government turns to make Madiba – so he couldn’t have gone wrong and you will get used to the fact that it is Mandela,” says Sisulu. Watch the video below for more:
