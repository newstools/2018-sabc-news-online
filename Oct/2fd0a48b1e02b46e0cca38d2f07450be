The Mahikeng Ministers Fellowship (MMF) in the North West is proposing that educators be taught self-defence in order to deal with ill-disciplined learners in schools. The call by MMF comes as the country still reels from shock following the recent killing of a teacher Daniel Mokolobate by a learner in Lehurutshe near Zeerust. Mokolobate had been teaching at the school for two years when he met his untimely death. MMF Spokesperson Lesiba Kgwele says teachers need to be taught how to defend themselves when they face danger. “Over and above the issue of security, we should look at empowering the educator so that when there is an incident that occurs in a classroom, a teacher is able to handle issues and ensure the safety of all other learners. In this respect we are proposing that teachers should be empowered with self-defence classes.” Watch the video below for related news:
