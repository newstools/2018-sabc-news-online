Scores of Koffiefontein residents in the southern Free State have been arrested. This is after they gathered outside the Letsemeng Local Municipality building, demanding a response to a memorandum they submitted to authorities two weeks ago. Among others, the residents are demanding the removal of the Mayor. Police were forced to use stun grenades to disperse angry community members outside the municipality’s offices. A large number of residents are now expected to appear in the Local Magistrate’s Court, after they were arrested for the illegal gathering. The angry residents want the local Mayor Thandiwe Reacheable, and her councillors to step down. Police Spokesperson, Thandi Mbambo says, “About 72 people have so far been arrested in Koffiefontein on charges of public violence and malicious damage to property and they will appear in the court of law soon.” Meanwhile, community leader Khumbulani Kabi says they will continue with their protest action until their demands are met. “We, the community of Koffiefontein, have decided since we are undermined by government not to respond to our demands. So, we, as the community, we have decided for an indefinite protest or an indefinite shutdown in town until we get our demand which is the removal of the mayor and her councillors,” says Kabi. Community members say the lack of service delivery has forced them to join the protest action.
