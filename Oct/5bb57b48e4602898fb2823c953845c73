The Democratic Alliance (DA) in the Free State says the African National Congress’ (ANC) factionalism and divisions are now visible in the province. DA provincial leader, Patricia Kopane, says revelations made by former MEC for Economic Development, Mxolisi Dukwana, on ANC secretary General Ace Magashule, is a step in the right direction to root out corruption. Dukwana revealed that he will appear before the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture to bring to the fore details of the clandestine meetings members of the provincial government had with the Guptas. “We believe this is an honourable action that he did. But these Revelations about the allegations shows that there’s much that it’s still unknown to the people of South Africa and the people of the Free State and for us it clearly shows that there’s so much that is going to be in the public domain and as the  DA we are really pleading to everyone in the Free State to come and be in front of the Zondo commission,” he says.
