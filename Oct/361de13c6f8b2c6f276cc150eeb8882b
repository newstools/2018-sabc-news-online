Four people have been killed in a crash on the N4 Toll road close to the Sudwala Cave turn-off west of Mbombela in Mpumalanga.  Road authorities say the driver of the truck lost control and hit an embankment and overturned. All four occupants, three males and a female died on the scene. Traffic flow on the N4 toll road came to a halt. A truck believed to be from Gauteng enroute to Mbombela to deliver goods didn’t reach its destination. Spokesperson for Safety & Security Mpumalanga Joseph Mabuza says: “The driver of the truck lost control and it went into an embankment and hit a tree. Unfortunately it overturned and four people were killed on impact.” Road authorities did not rule out the bad weather conditions. “We believe that there’s a possibility that is a factor in this crash, however we cannot rule out other factors such as speeding. The report we are going to get will give us a clear cause of the crash,” adds Mabuza. The deceased have not yet been identified. Authorities have warned motorists to be cautious on the roads as they are wet and slippery. WATCH BELOW:
