The National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (Numsa) has won the right to continue with its strike in the plastic sector. The Labour Court in Johannesburg has dismissed the application of the Plastic Converters of South Africa to interdict the workers’ strike. Numsa has vowed to intensify the strike. Spokesperson Phakamile Hlubi-Majola says the only way to stop the strike is for the employer to give in to the workers’ demands. “The employers claimed that our strike was illegal and they have been peddling this propaganda in an attempt to victimise the workers and stop them from making their demands. Today (Friday) the court found in our favour and dismissed the application of the employers, they lost the case. We condemn the employers for trying to silence our members, from trying to victimise our members and stop them from exercising their right to strike.” Click below for more on the story:
