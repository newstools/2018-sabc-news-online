The Democratic Allianceâ€™s Federal Executive Deputy Chairperson, Natasha Mazzone, says the party merely fulfilled its legal obligation by reporting bribery allegations against outgoing Cape Town Mayor, Patricia de Lille to the police. De Lille announced during a media briefing in Cape Town that the National Prosecuting Authority dropped the investigation against her relating to Gauteng businessman, Anthony Faul, due to a lack of evidence. Faul claimed that De Lille sought a bribe of R5 million for him to be awarded a tender to supply the City of Cape Town with a fire retardant paint to use in informal settlements. De Lille plans to sue Faul for defamation. Mazzone says the DA reported the matter as is required under the Prevention and Combating of Corrupt Activities Act. Click below for more on the story:
