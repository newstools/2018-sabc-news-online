Gauteng Social Development MEC Nandi Mayathula-Khoza is expected to visit the family of a woman who was shot and killed in Westbury, Johannesburg on Wednesday. The 43 year old and her 10 year old daughter were caught in the midst of gang violence in the area last Thursday; the incident led to the violent protests that have plagued the community. Community members were addressed by Police Minister Bheki Cele on Wednesday, after they demanded that he visit the area. Spokesperson for the Department Mbangwa Xaba says, “As a Head of Social Development, she’ll also be accompanied by social workers who will be there to provide psycho-social counselling to the family, especially to the little girl who survived. It’s really to just provide support as a caring government.” Xaba says, “We will always place children first and in this time when they are exposed to what that little girl is going through, as government we would like to provide that particular support.” Watch related video below:
