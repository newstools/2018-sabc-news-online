The African National Congress(ANC) in Limpopo has admitted there were serious transgressions committed by party officials, including at municipalities in the VBS collapse and looting. A party task team headed by Dickson Masemola tabled its report before the special ANC PEC sitting Wednesday night. ANC provincial deputy chairperson and Vhembe mayor Florence Radzilani and provincial treasurer Danny Msiza have been deeply implicated by the Reserve Bank report on VBS. ANC provincial secretary Soviet Lekganyane says their case will be handled by the party’s integrity commission. He says: “The comrades whose names are being mentioned in the report should be subjected to the ANC national integrity report.” “The comrades have also publicly declared that they will cooperate with the processes of the ANC and once those processes are concluded, the report will be made both available to the leadership of the ANC at national level and at provincial level.” Related video
