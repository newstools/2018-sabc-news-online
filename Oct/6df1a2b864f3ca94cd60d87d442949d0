Relative calm has returned to Westbury, Johannesburg, this after an engagement between Police Minister Bheki Cele and residents during a visit by a high profile police delegation to the troubled township on Tuesday. Residents are up in arms over the scourge of drugs and crime in the area. After blocking the main road in the early hours of the morning all eyes were on police minister Bheki Cele as residents waited for him to arrive. There was pressure from the residents claiming government has neglected coloured communities. When he arrived the minister promised to assist residents curb the abuse of drugs in the area. There seems to be some peace as residents cleaned up the debris. They have embarked on a clean-up operation of the area following three days of running battles between police and residents.  Meanwhile, Gauteng Social Development MEC, Nandi Mayathula-Khoza is expected to visit the family of a woman who was shot and killed in Westbury, on Wednesday. The forty-three-year-old and a girl were caught in the midst of gang violence in the area last Thursday. The death sparked violent protests. Spokesperson for the Department, Mbangwa Xaba says,  “As a Head of Social Development, she’ll also be accompanied by social workers who will be there to provide psycho-social to the family, especially to the little girl who survived. It’s really to just provide support as a caring government. We will always place children first and in this time when they are exposed to what that little girl is going through, as government we would like to provide that particular support.” Residents have, however, warned of more protests should the Police Minister Bheki Cele’s promise not yield positive results. Community leader Carol Sally explains “We are not happy at all, but they said within 24-hours we wanna see a change. If we don’t see change within 24 hours believe me we will burn.”
