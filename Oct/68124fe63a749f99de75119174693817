The lawyer for Nigerian Pastor, Timothy Omotoso says his client will not receive a fair trial. Peter Daubermann is applying on behalf of Omotoso and co-accused Lusanda Sulani and Zukiswa Sitho that Judge Mandela Makaula recuse himself from the case. The rape trial resumed Monday morning in the High Court in Port Elizabeth. The first witness, 22-year-old Cheryl Zondi, testified last week alleging that Omotoso sexually groomed and raped her since she was 14-years-old. He allegedly abused 30 teenage girls. The state has indicated that it would call the second witness on Monday.    Earlier, Daubermann said Omotoso’s two co-accused have been excused from court as they fear for their lives. It follows incidents where the two women, Lusanda Sulani and Zukiswa Sitho, and their supporters were allegedly mobbed and drenched in water, outside the Port Elizabeth High Court last week. He added that the same happened to him and Omotoso’s wife Taiwo. He says there were too few police deployed at court. He also referred to false media reports and describes it as an attack on the judiciary. Daubermann has expressed his concern that neither he nor the accused can come to court safely. It’s the judge’s duty to ensure a fair trial, says Daubermann.
