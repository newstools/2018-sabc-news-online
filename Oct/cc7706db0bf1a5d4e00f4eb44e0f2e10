The South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) has expressed concern about a WhatsApp message doing the rounds, warning the public of would-be robbers posing as SABC TV licence agents, particularly in areas in the west of Johannesburg. The public broadcaster says it has not appointed any inspectors or officials to conduct physical inspections of television sets in households. It says any person claiming to be an official or agent from the SABC to gain access to private premises, does not represent the broadcaster and should be reported to the police.
