The Eastern Cape government has renamed the King Holmes Building in King William’s Town, after struggle icon Albertina Sisulu. This is part of paying homage to Mama Sisulu as the country celebrates her centenary anniversary. The building has been earmarked to house the provincial Department of Transport following its purchase by the Department of Public Works. The name change happens at a time when government expenditure on leased buildings is a topical issue. Transport MEC, Weziwe Tikana says they hope the building will inspire workers to be dedicated. “We want those workers not to undermine themselves [but] to always remember that there are those women who were able to fight patriarchy, who were able to do things and also keep the values,” adds Tikana. Linda Ginyibhulu Sisulu says as her family is honoured by the gesture. “Any institution or road that’s named after her represents everybody more especially the woman of this country. Whenever they see a building or a road named after her they should know that it is them that are represented in that name,” explains Ginyibhulu Sisulu.
