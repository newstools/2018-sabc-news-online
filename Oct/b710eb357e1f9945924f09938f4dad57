Western Cape Democratic Alliance (DA) leader Bonginkosi Madikizela believes the resignation of five party councillors had been on the cards for some time. The councillors announced their resignation on Thursday, shortly after outgoing Mayor Patricia De Lille delivered her last address in council. The resignations took place during a council meeting where an independent report by Bowman Gilfillan, which implicates De Lille in covering up alleged corruption, was adopted. The councillors stated that they do not agree with how the DA operates and how De Lille has been treated. Madikizela believes the resignations were not a last minute decision. “Those allegations that were made were made conveniently, because people had to come up with excuses for them to leave…  We are very much aware that the plans to leave the party have been on the cards for some time, and we will issue a statement in due course to tell exactly what is happening here,” says Madikizela.
