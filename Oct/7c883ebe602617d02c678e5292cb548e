The Democratic Alliance (DA)  has challenged the SABC to reveal whether the current COO Chris Maroleng is receiving the same inflated salary for the position that was paid to former COO Hlaudi Motsoeneng. The DA’s Phumzile Van Damme says Maroleng was appointed before the 2017/2018 annual report was released to Parliament at the end of March 2018. Van Damme says the March 31 annual report reveals that top management and executives were earning the same inflated salaries, placing the COO at R2.7 million a year. She was counter-responding to the SABC’s claims that its new executives were appointed on a reduced salary. Van Damme says only the CEO and CFO were employed after the annual report was released, not the COO. “The current COO of the SABC Chris Maroleng, who was employed in January,  would have earned a salary that Hlaudi Motsoeneng earned.” “So what we are asking for is first for the amounts of CEO and CFO who were hired in June 2018, we would like to know what package they are receiving.” “We would like to know whether Mr Maroleng continues to receive that way or has it been reduced. This is quite a simple request. It’s not difficult. Their salaries are revealed annually in the annual reports.” EFF rejects retrenchments at SABC The EFF has, meanwhile, challenged government to make the financial guarantee letter available to the SABC to allow it to get funding to bring stability. EFF member on Parliament’s Communications Committee, Mbuyiseni Ndlozi says the official letter from Treasury has not yet been given to the public broadcaster. He says the EFF rejects retrenchments as the mechanism used to cut costs at the public broadcaster Related video click below:
