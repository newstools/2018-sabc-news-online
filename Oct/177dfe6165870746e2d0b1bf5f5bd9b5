In the build-up to the National Cancer awareness campaign, the KwaZulu-Natal Health Department has launched a provincial mass cancer screening at Greys Hospital in Pietermaritzburg. This as South Africa observes Breast Cancer Awareness Month. Earlier this year, over 3 000 women were screened for cancer at the Inkosi Albert Luthuli Hospital. Provincial Health MEC Dr Sibongiseni Dhlomo says there are already over 300 patients that are being attended to. “The message is if you screen early for diseases, cancer included, you are likely to get a cure. We may not be in every part of the corner in our province at any given time but we want to say this campaign is continuing in all our areas.” Dhlomo further encouraged people to not only go to the clinic when they are sick but to also go for cancer screening.
