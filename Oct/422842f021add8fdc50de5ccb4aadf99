The bail application for six men accused of the killing of African National Congress (ANC) activist Musawenkosi Qashana Mchunu has again been postponed until Wednesday. The bail hearing was due to begin on Tuesday at the Pietermaritzburg Magistrate’s Court. The case was moved to the Regional court last week after the presiding Magistrate recused himself. This follows an National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) application for him to step aside. The NPA accused him of having had inappropriate meetings with the defence. The suspects were arrested last month by members of the special task team investigating political killings in KwaZulu-Natal. Outside court, there was heavy police presence as ANC members protested for and against bail.
