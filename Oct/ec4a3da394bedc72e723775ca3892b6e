The Eastern Cape Department of Social Development has removed seven children from their home in  Hebehebe village in Ngqamakhwe and placed them in a place of safety. This after the department was granted a court interdict to remove them after allegations that their parents have been prohibiting them from attending school and interacting with other children. Their parents are staunch members of the controversial Mancoba Seven Angels Church, which was based in Ngcobo and allegedly involved in the attack on police at the local police station early in 2018. Spokesperson Gcobani Mawsana says the department is processing the children’s legal documents including birth certificates. “As a Department of Social Development, we are mandated to protect and upheld the rights of the children. We are very happy with the contribution or the participation of the community in that area that has led us to make sure that we interact with other government agencies, ensuring that these rights of the children are protected. And the Children’s Court has proven that and we’re happy now the place of safety for those children have been secured and they’re going to be leaving under the condition where their rights will be upheld.”
