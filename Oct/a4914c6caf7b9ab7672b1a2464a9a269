Home Affairs Minister, Malusi Gigaba‘s spokesperson, Vuyo Mkhize, says he believes the release of a sexually explicit video that has been circulating online will not impact negatively on the minister’s duties. Gigaba claims the video is at the centre of blackmail and extortion attempts against him, and was obtained when his phone was hacked when he was still Minister of Finance. Mkhize says the contents of the video were intended for Gigaba’s wife, Norma. Mkhize says due to Gigaba’s privacy being invaded, he won’t consider quitting his position. “Minister Gigaba is not the first public representative whose had his private life splashed out in public in a manner that does not in any way impact on his public duties. I am not going to mention any names. Nobody ever intends for their ‘shower hour’ to become public viewing. There is always a chance that you will be hacked. The iPad is his, the cellphone I think is government issued.” Click related video below:
