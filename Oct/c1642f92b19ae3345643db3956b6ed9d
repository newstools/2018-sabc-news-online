The African National Congress (ANC) PEC has disbanded its Nelson Mandela Bay Regional Executive Committee leadership in the Eastern Cape. ANC provincial secretary Lulama Ngcukaitobi says they have taken the decision after reports showed that the functionality of branches in the region is not at an acceptable level. “All the four reports indicate that the region was in the margin of approximately 60%, functionality that is not acceptable in terms of the standards of the ANC.” “Let alone that there is an element that the region has been without a regional chairperson for approximately a year and above, ever since comrade Lungisa was removed as the chairperson of the ANC through the ANC internal processes.” The party says it will announce a task team in due course, but insists that Andile Lungisa will not be part of it. The party in the province earlier asked Lungisa to step down as a member of the mayoral committee in the Mandela Bay Metro, following his conviction for the assault of Democratic Alliance (DA) councillor, Rano Kayser. Lungisa was sentenced to two years imprisonment, which he has filed an application to appeal. Related video click below:
