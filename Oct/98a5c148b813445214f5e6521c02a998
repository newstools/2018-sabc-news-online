Activists of the Right2Know Campaign have handed over a memorandum of grievances to the SABC management in Sea Point. The group had a lunch hour picket outside the broadcaster’s offices demanding more consultation on the SABC’s turnaround strategy. They have rejected proposed staff retrenchments and what they say are proposed TV license fee increases. The activist group has criticised the SABC’s proposed turnaround strategy as anti-public. The SABC is going through a financial crisis. A few weeks ago, the Board tabled a turnaround strategy in Parliament. It is this strategy that the Right2Know Campaign does not agree with. Right2Know Campaign Activist, Songezo Mazizi  says: “We know for a fact that corporate, political parties have captured SABC. There is little content about the grassroots, that input that comes from the community. There is a lot of advertisement that has taken over at the SABC.” The picket attracted people from all walks of life. Those from disadvantaged areas showed up to also have their voices heard. The memorandum was accepted by the SABC’s Western Cape Provincial General Manager. SABC WC Provincial Manager James Shikwambana says: “We welcome engagements with our various stakeholders across the country and we will handover this memorandum to our authorities in Auckland Park.” The Right2Know Campaign has asked for the SABC to address the protesters. It wants stakeholder engagements where people on the ground will be allowed to have a say on how the SABC turnaround strategy is implemented.
