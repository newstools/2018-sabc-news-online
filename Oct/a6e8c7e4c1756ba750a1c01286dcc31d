The driver of the bus in which nine people were killed after it overturned outside Polokwane last month is expected to appear again in the Limpopo Capital’s Magistrate’s court on Tuesday. Forty-one-year-old George Themba is facing nine counts of culpable homicide as well as a reckless driving charge. In his last brief appearance, Themba was once again denied bail and still remains in police custody. He was arrested while allegedly attempting to cross the border into Zimbabwe after his discharge from hospital. Police say they are conducting investigations as well as speeding up efforts to compile his profile.
