A 20-year-old Gift of the Givers volunteer has been shot dead in Hanover Park on the Cape Flats. Ameerodien Noordien was hit by a stray bullet during a suspected gang crossfire. Gift of the Givers Project Manager, Ali Sablay, says Noordien was a pillar for his community. “He was one of the shiny youth we chose. He was the sole breadwinner of his house whose life were tragically taken away last night when a rival gang started shooting into the road. Ameerodien sustained four bullets (wounds); three to the back and one to the head and died instantly. To the family, we offer our heartfelt condolences. We know this is a very big loss for you. And we’ll always be there for the family.” Meanwhile, a 64-year-old man from Storms River in the Eastern Cape has been arrested for the illegal possession of drugs with a street  value of almost half a million rand. Police Spokesperson Majola Nkohli says a multidisciplinary task team raided the elderly man’s house and seized 200 kilograms of dagga and almost two kilograms of crystal meth. Nkuhli says the suspect is expected to appear in the Humansdorp Magistrate Court on Monday, on charges of dealing in dagga and crystal meth.
