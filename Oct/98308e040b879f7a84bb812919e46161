Dozens of African National Congress branches in the Nelson Mandela Bay region in the Eastern Cape have announced that they support the disbandment of the party’s regional structure. This emerged in a media briefing held on Sunday at the Ngoza Jebe Hall in New Brighton in Port Elizabeth. The briefing has been addressed by some chairpersons and secretaries of branches in the Metro. The REC has been disbanded by the Provincial Executive Committee citing a number of reasons including the poor performance of branches in this region currently standing at an unacceptable 60 percent and its failure to elect a chairperson after Andile Lungisa was removed last year. Spokesperson for the branches,Wandisile Jikeka says the PEC’s decision is long overdue. “Basically, the branches are raising these issues to support the decision of the PEC. Now that we have heard the REC is appealing, so there was a unanimous decision by all branches that were there to say that decision was correct. The REC appealed on their own. There was no consultation with the structures of the ANC.” Watch related video:
