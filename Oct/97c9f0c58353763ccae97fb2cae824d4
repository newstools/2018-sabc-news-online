The Democratic Alliance (DA) in the Northern Cape has called on the Health MEC in the province, Fufu Makatong, to increase access to cancer services. This comes after the Dr Harry Surtie Hospital had not procured a mammography machinery for the regional facility, leaving patients to travel long distances to different hospitals for screening. The party’s Premier Candidate, Andrew Louw says that is unacceptable “It seems to us that this is not treated with the seriousness that it deserves. A lot of people are vulnerable with cancer, and cancer is everybody’s business – and I’m deeply disappointed that the Department of Health seems to have a kind of lackadaisical approach towards cancer patients,” says Louw.
