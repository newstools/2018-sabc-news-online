The European Commission on Monday urged the United States and Russia to pursue talks to preserve a nuclear weapons treaty after President Donald Trump said Washington was withdrawing from the deal. The Commission, the 28-nation European Union executive, stressed the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF) as a cornerstone of European defence for the last three decades. “The US and the Russian federation need to remain in a constructive dialogue to preserve this treaty and ensure it is fully and verifiably implemented,” spokeswoman Maja Kocijancic told reporters. She said the treaty was important for both European and global security. “The treaty for Intermediate-Range Forces in Europe contributed to the end of the Cold War, to the end of the nuclear arms race and is one of the cornerstones of European security architecture since it entered force 30 years ago,” she added. “And thanks to this treaty almost 3000 missiles with nuclear and conventional warheads have been removed and verifiably destroyed,” Kocijancic said. “It is also an important contribution to disarmament obligations under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty,” she said. The treaty banning intermediate-range nuclear and conventional missiles was signed in 1987 by then US president Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev, the last Soviet leader. Gorbachev on Sunday said that “dropping these agreements shows a lack of wisdom” and was a “mistake”.
