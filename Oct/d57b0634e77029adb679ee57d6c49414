The former eThekwini councillor Kessie Nair, who posted a video of himself on social networks calling President Cyril Ramaphosa the derogatory K-word, is expected to know the outcome of his bail application on Tuesday. Kessie Nair appeared disappointed when his younger brother Krishnan testified against him in the bail application. Krishnan Nair told the court that his brother was insane and should get medical assistance. The state wants Kessie to be sent to Fort Napier Psychiatric Hospital for evaluation. Nair faces seven counts of crimen injuria and two other charges related to the Riotous Assemblies Act. His brother says he is concerned. “He seriously needs medical attention, we are concerned about him.  It is clear in his mind that in his video he has posted, it doesn’t come from a person of a sound mind.” Watch the video below for more:
