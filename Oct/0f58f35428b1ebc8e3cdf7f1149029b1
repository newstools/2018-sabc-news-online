President Cyril Ramaphosa has assured African National Congress (ANC) members that the National Executive Committee (NEC) has recommitted itself to forge unity, and to deal with divisions within its ranks. Ramaphosa was addressing the Winnie Madikizela-Mandela lecture in Johannesburg on Sunday night. He said in the memory of Mama Winnie who detested factions within the ruling party, the NEC meeting which ended on Sunday has reaffirmed to build the ANC. The state of the ANC pre-NASREC was a matter of grave concern to the late Mama Winnie. This past week, the ANC remembered her life and legacy, during what could have been her 82 years birth day. The highlights of the week of commemorations were a lecture by the party’s president. Ramaphosa reminded ANC members about the sacrifices of Mama Winnie, who put South Africans first before her own children during the dark days of the brutal apartheid system. She met Mandela during the risky times.  It also meant being a mother in trying times. She began a life characterised by detentions and exiles. She harboured deep wounds, inflicted by the apartheid forces unto her life. Ramaphosa says Mama Winnie committed her entire life to the unity of the people. “We must challenge racism that is rearing its head.  The question of unity of the ANC is not negotiable. Mama Winnie despaired any sign of division any division and contestation for resource, “says Ramaphosa. He assured his supporters that the ANC will go into next year’s elections united than ever, in memory of the late struggle icon, Madikizela-Mandela.
