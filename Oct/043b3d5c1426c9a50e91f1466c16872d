Democratic Alliance (DA) Mayor-elect for Cape Town Dan Plato will be sworn in as a councillor on Thursday. This follows Patricia de Lille‘s public resignation as Cape Town Mayor on Wednesday, ending uncertainty over whether she would actually go. Plato has served under numerous portfolios in the DA. He also previously served as DA Mayor in the City of Cape Town. On Thursday, he’ll be sworn in as councillor and finally replace De Lille. A special city council meeting will be convened next week to elect a new executive mayor. Plato says ensuring public safety will remain his priority once he becomes mayor. He says there’s a need to increase police visibility in some communities. “Looking at the Western Cape Government to the National Commissioner of Police for he deployment of about 1000 police reservists if we can get that done I think it will help us a great deal with regard to to dealing with visible policing in our communities.” Cape Town residents had this to say about the future mayor.  “I hope the person who will come in will bring stability within the city,” says on resident. Another says “I actually don’t care who is there or not. It doesn’t bother me because they do nothing for us.” The DA is also working on replacing seven other councillors who’ve resigned in support of De Lille in Cape Town. The party has welcomed De Lille’s resignation as mayor and party member. It says it notes allegations of racism made by De Lille and other councillors and will continue to prioritise the needs of all Capetonians.
