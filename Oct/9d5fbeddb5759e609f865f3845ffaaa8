The late Minister of Environmental Affairs Edna Molewa has been buried at the Zandfontein Cemetery in Pretoria West. The 61-year-old died two weeks ago at a Pretoria hospital after a short illness. Earlier, mourners gathered at the Tshwane Events Centre to pay tribute to Molewa. President Cyril Ramaphosa delivered the eulogy, saying he was saddened by the fact that Molewa fell ill following a trip to China where she was part of the presidential delegation. Gauteng Premier David Makhura says South Africa has lost an outstanding campaigner for global peace and environmental justice in Environmental Affairs while her children and grandchildren described her as caring. Meanwhile, whilst delivering the eulogy President Ramaphosa revealed that Molewa was buried in an eco-friendly coffin, made of wood from invasive alien plants that have been cut down by the Working for Water Programme. This is the brainchild of late Water Affairs Minister Kader Asmal in partnership with faith-based organizations. Asmal was also buried in an eco-friendly coffin in 2011. Ramaphosa says it was always her wish to be laid to rest in such a coffin. “The eco-friendly coffin project was piloted in 2005 with the help of a R1 million grant (150 thousand dollars) from the World Bank. Given the exorbitant cost of funerals in South Africa, the eco-friendly coffin project aims to reduce the cost of bereavement by producing high-quality coffins at almost cost price. The Working for Water Programme is a government initiative aimed at eradicating invasive plants infesting millions of hectares in the country. The project has since expanded with eco furniture factories set up in various parts of the country, creating over a thousand employment opportunities.” Click below for more on the story:
