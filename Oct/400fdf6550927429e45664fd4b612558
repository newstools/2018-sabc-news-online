The Thabo Mbeki Foundation has conveyed its deepest condolences to the families of the late trade unionist Eric Stalin Mtshali and former minister of foreign affairs Pik Botha. In a statement, the foundation says Mtshali and Botha fought on the opposite sides of South Africaâ€™s conflict. Mtshali fought for a South Africa which belongs to all who live in it and Botha on the other hand became the global face of the apartheid system. It further says the two were committed to diametrically opposed value systems but their paths converged in the national interest to produce a political settlement without which our country would have become a wasteland. The Foundation says the country needs to learn from the two who laid down their arms and sat around the negotiation table in search for a political settlement.
