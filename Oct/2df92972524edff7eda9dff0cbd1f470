As the country marks 100 years of Albertina Sisulu, guests at the Croesus Cemetery have paid tribute to the anti-apartheid struggle stalwart, who passed away on the secondÂ  of June in 2011. Minister in the Presidency Jeff Radebe, Communications minister Nomvula Mokonyane, Gauteng Premier David Makhura and members of the Sisulu family earlier arrived at the Croesus Cemetery in Newclare in Johannesburg, to pay their respects. They participated in a wreath laying ceremony remembering her life, and the contributions she has made in the struggle for liberation of South Africa. The Thanksgiving service is being held at the Holy Cross Anglican Church in Soweto.
