Western Cape traffic authorities say all roads in the Southern Cape that were closed due to a number of veld fires in the region, have been reopened. Provincial Traffic chief Kenny Africa says he contacted the Knysna, Plettenberg Bay and Oudtshoorn Police stations, who have confirmed that all roads are open.   The Knysna municipality meanwhile says that residents of the Brenton Community who were evacuated on Tuesday to the local community hall, were late Tuesday night transported back to their homes. The Gift of the Givers organisation is coordinating with the municipality to supply food and blankets to residents in community halls, including Sedgefield, which is the holding area for the people from Karatara. The municipality says the Karatara area, where eight people died in the fire on Monday, is now safe. There is however still a severe smoke problem, which may delay the return of people to their houses.
