Over 400 previously displaced farmworkers from Kokstad in southern KwaZulu-Natal have received title deeds to their homes after many years of suffering. The beneficiaries now own homes in the newly-developed township of Franklin. President Cyril Ramaphosa says this is part of government’s commitment to changing lives and restore dignity. Selina Mtolo says: “I am beyond happy, this is a day I will never forget. We have suffered with my child living in farm compounds earning R10 rand a week. Our prayers have been answered, we are thankful to our government.” Lucia Makhaya adds: “We never thought this day would come. Thank God. I am lost for words with joy. It’s a happy day.” Over 4.3 million RDP houses have been built by government over the past 24 years. President Ramaphosa says while this is a huge milestone, a lot more needs to be done. He says government is also focused on building a stronger economy that will see the creation of much-needed jobs. It wasn’t just the residents of Franklin who had much to celebrate, communities in and around Kokstad, will also be able to access government services at new home affairs offices. This is part of government’s commitment of bringing services to previously disadvantaged areas.
