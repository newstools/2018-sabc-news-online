Johannesburg Emergency Services says disaster monitoring teams remain on high alert as heavy rains have rendered the roads slippery. The South African Weather Service has forecast heavy downpours, strong and damaging winds and the possibility of hail throughout most of the country this weekend. The City’s emergency services spokesperson, Robert Mulaudzi has urged motorists to be cautious. He says: “Motorists are urged to continue to exercise caution when driving, since most of our roads are wet and slippery. Extend a safe following distance, obey the rules of the road, avoid crossing flooded roads and bridges.” “From our side as emergency services, we continue to remain on high alert monitoring most of our low-lying areas, especially our informal settlements,” adds Mulaudzi.
