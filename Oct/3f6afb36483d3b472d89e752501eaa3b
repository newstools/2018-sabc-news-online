The anti-land invasion unit in Cape Town is demolishing shacks on a tract of land at Phase Nine in Wallacedene near Kraaifontein. The city says unoccupied structures in the area are being removed in terms of an interdict. Residents say they are occupying the land because they are not working and can’t afford to pay rent. City officials are being assisted by Metro Police and the SAPS. Some of the land occupiers have vowed to rebuild as soon as they can afford to buy new material. Mayoral Committee Member for settlements, Xanthea Limberg, says the structures were removed in terms of an interdict. “It should be noted that this particular land parcel was in part identified as a relocation area for persons evicted from nearby farms. It is earmarked for legal and planned human settlements purposes. This is not an eviction and thus alternative accommodation is per law not applicable.”
