It’s not yet clear if the residents of Westbury in Johannesburg West will continue with their protest on Tuesday ahead of Police Minister Bheki Cele’s visit to their area. The streets in the area remain littered with debris, blocking access to motorists, however police are still maintaining a heavy presence in the area. The police were engaged in running battles with angry protesters on Monday. A Rea Vaya bus station was partly damaged in the evening after protesting residents pelted it with stones and threw a petrol bomb. Residents have been protesting against drugs and other forms of crimes in the area. The protest, which started on Friday, was sparked by an alleged gang-related shooting in which a woman was killed and a child critically injured. Watch the video below for related news:
