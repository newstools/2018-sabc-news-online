The Pretoria Magistrate’s Court has ruled that the media is only allowed to take photographs and not videos in the case of a 20-year-old man accused of raping a girl at the Dros restaurant in Silverton, east of Pretoria. Gauteng NPA spokesperson Phindi Mjonondwana has confirmed that the alleged victim is seven. Tshwane executive mayor Solly Msimanga has joined the hundreds of people that have gathered outside the court from various political parties and social groupings that are supporting the alleged victim and demanding that the accused be denied bail. The accused is charged with rape, assault with intent to cause grievously bodily harm and being in possession of drugs. Msimanga says they will fully support the girl’s family. “We did offer as a city all the assistance that we can, offer to the family whether it’s counselling or whatever it is –  that they might need at this point in time. We have made that particular avenue available to them.” Watch below for more:
