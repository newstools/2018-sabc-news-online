The African National Congress (ANC) top six officials have met the Limpopo leadership to discuss the alleged involvement of senior provincial party members in the looting of VBS mutual bank. Provincial party treasurer, Danny Msiza and deputy chairperson and Vhembe executive mayor Florence Radzilani are among the 53 persons implicated in the VBS scandal. ANC spokesperson Pule Mabe says Luthuli House is calling for urgent action for those involved in the bank scandal. “ Our seriousness to attend to corporate crimes, we said that it should be in the same way that we are supposed to be attending to Steinhoff and many others whether it’s KPMG and many other issues that would have come out after being exposed as part of the corporate rot. The ANC is calling for action.” WATCH BELOW:  READ FULL REPORT BELOW:
