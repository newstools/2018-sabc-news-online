Residents of the SST informal settlement at Town 2 in Khayelitsha, Cape Town have appealed for proper houses in the areas. One person was confirmed dead and at least 800 people displaced after an estimated 200 shacks were destroyed by fire. Western Cape Human Settlement Minister Bonginkosi Madikizela visited the area and spoke to residents about future plans. Affected residents had already started to rebuild their shacks when Madikizela arrived in the area. They have appealed to government to build for them proper houses. Some residents say they have lost everything, while others say they managed to save only a few of their belongings. “I only saved my three kids, but we have nothing. We don’t have food. I just woke up at 2 when I smelt a smoke. The fire was too far, but in a blink of an eye, the fire was here and I could not save anything. The only thing we are asking, make a plan. We can’t live in shacks for the rest of our lives with our children. It’s not safe.” The Cape Town City’s disaster team has already started to clear the rubble at the site. Bulldozers have also moved in and Madikizela appealed to affected residents to give the City time to clean the area, while plans for a long term solution are being discussed. He also met with local leaders to discuss a long-term solution. “The first issue is the resettlement plan and also the long-term plan. My view, let us clear the site, make sure all the people affected are resettled here, but build them in such a way that it’s going to be easy to put services in future.” Affected people will be housed at local community centres and church halls as part of the short-term measures. The City says starter building kits will be delivered on Sunday morning. Click below for more on the story:
