Police Minister General Bheki Cele together with National Police Commissioner Khehla Sitole will on Thursday launch the National Safer Festive Season crime-fighting campaign at Motherwell in Port Elizabeth. The crime fighting campaign is themed “Quiet Storm” and is aimed at making South Africa a safe place during the festive season. The city has a huge problem of gangsterism in the Northern Areas. National police spokesperson, Reneilwe Serero says they want to reduce criminal activities in coastal towns and cities: “We all know during the festive season where people get their time to relax with their families and recollect over the year and what has happened over the year. People like to go to the coastal areas and relax and the reason why PE, is because we know of the traffic that flows down from Gauteng and other provinces. The popular coastal areas around December time are the Western Cape, Durban and PE as well in particular. And again I must say PE is one of the ports of entries in the country so the reason it was chosen is purely because of that.”
