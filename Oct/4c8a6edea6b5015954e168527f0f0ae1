The Trade Union Nehawu strike at St Thomas School for the Deaf in the Eastern Cape has affected the first day of exams. The support staff which include housekeepers, cleaners, cooks and security officers have refused to work during weekends since September. They argue that they are not getting paid double when working on Sunday as per the Basic Conditions of Employment Act. The striking members have barricaded entrances, refusing for teachers to go inside the school. Learners who reside at the boarding facilities of the school did not have their breakfast Tuesday morning as workers have downed tools. Workers are saying they will not open the gates until they get a clear indication from the department on when they will get their money. Some educators, who are locked outside the premises, say they are concerned that learners who are supposed to write exams could be negatively affected by this. They have called on all parties involved to speedily find a lasting solution.
