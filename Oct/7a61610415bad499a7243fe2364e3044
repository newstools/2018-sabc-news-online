Gale force winds are causing chaos along the Eastern Cape coastal route. The South African Weather Service issued a warning of heavy winds ranging between 65 to 70 kilometres per hour.  A heavy duty harbour crane has been blown over in the Port Elizabeth harbour. It is lying partially across the entrance to the harbour. Harbour officials are assessing the situation but it is unclear at this stage what delays it might cause to shipping in and out the harbour. The high winds have forced the workings of the harbour to be suspended. Trees are reported to have been blown across many roads in and around Nelson Mandela Bay and motorists have urged to be exercise caution when driving.
