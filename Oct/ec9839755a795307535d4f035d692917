Acting CEO of Rahima Moosa Hospital in Johannesburg Frew Benson says an outbreak which claimed the lives of nine children at the facility was declared over in August. The disease, known as Necrotizing Enterocolitis, normally occurs in premature babies. Benson says more than 90% of the affected 43 children were born premature and that the exact cause of the disease is not fully understood. Benson says the outbreak occurred over a five-month period. “From March 2018 to July 2018, over that period, nine children out of 43 cases had died. But the deaths did not occur in the last month. The outbreak was controlled round about the middle of May and no cases in the month of July. The outbreak was declared over in the month of August.” He adds that they have now increased control measures at the facility. Watch the video below for related news:
