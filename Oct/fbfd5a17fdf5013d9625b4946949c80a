The Democratic Alliance’s (DA) motion on the deadly Johannesburg building fire will be debated in the Gauteng Provincial Legislature on Tuesday. The party brought the motion forward following the blaze which claimed the lives of three fire fighters last month. The Bank of Lisbon building in the Johannesburg CBD, which housed three Gauteng government departments, was found to be only 20% compliant with health and safety standards. It later emerged that seven other government buildings in the city are non-compliant. The DA in Gauteng says through this motion they want to ensure that there is accountability not only for the fire, but for all unsafe provincial buildings that endanger staff. DA’s  Health Shadow minister Jack Bloom says, “The DA wants accountability for the Bank of Lisbon fire were three people lost their lives and many others were injured. It’s very serious and we believe the most accountable people are MEC’s Infrastructure Development MEC Jacob Mamabolo and Health MEC Gwen Ramokgopa.” “The DA is calling on them to resign or they need to fire them,” adds Bloom.
