Westbury mother, Heather Peterson, has been laid to rest in the township in Johannesburg. Peterson’s life was celebrated in a packed church on Saturday morning. Community members took to the streets, shutting the area down after Peterson was killed when she was caught in crossfire allegedly between rival gangs last week. One relative thanked the community for their support. “I could see that Heather loved people. She loved children and I just want to say thank you to God that he borrowed Heather to us on this earth. I just want to say thank you to each and everybody who showed their love to Heather.” Click below for more on Westbury :
