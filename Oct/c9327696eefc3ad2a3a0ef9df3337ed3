The funeral service of ANC stalwart and diplomat Moses “Moss” Chikane is under way at the Mamelodi International Assemblies of God Church Hall, east of Pretoria. The former liberation struggle hero and founder member of the United Democratic Front (UDF) passed away last week after a long illness last week, aged 69. Hundreds of mourners are attending the funeral service. They include top ANC members including the party’s Treasurer General Paul Mashatile, Gauteng Premier David Makhura, deputy Speaker of the National Assembly Lechesa Tsenoli and Chikane’s cousin Reverend Frank Chikane. After the advent of democracy, Chikane served as ambassador to Germany from 2005 to 2010 and was then posted to Zambia for a full term. Chikane is survived by five sons and a daughter, three brothers and four sisters. He  will be laid to rest at a local  Mamelodi cemetery later.
