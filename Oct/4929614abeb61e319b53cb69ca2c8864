The South African Revenue Service(SARS) has warned that taxpayers who fail to file tax returns by this month’s deadlines could face penalties from November 1. Saturday is the last day to file tax returns at SARS branches which are open today. The e-filing deadline is Wednesday 31st of October. SARS Executive Compliance Auditor, Fareed Khan says SARS is doing its best to ensure that the e-filing system is as user-friendly as possible. He says: “SARS has done several things to make it easy for people to comply. We have extensive education programmes where we support or provide easy access for taxpayers to our branches, to e-filing. We have extended hours at our branches where people can even go in on a Saturday to submit their returns. But we would like to warn taxpayers that despite these efforts, if they fail to comply, there are unfortunately consequences. Penalties are applicable from November 1 if they haven’t complied but penalties are a last resort, we encourage people to comply voluntarily.” Khan also says SARS has committed to paying out refunds to personal income taxpayers within 21 days of being compliant. He says SARS has made a commitment to personal income taxpayers that they will pay out refunds within 21 days of becoming compliant. He says: “Many taxpayers assume that submitting a return means that they are compliant. Often SARS requests additional supporting documentation to prove the declarations that they have made. Once you have submitted these requested documents that you are compliant and within 21 days of submitting those documents, we have committed and in most cases 95%, we have complied with the commitment that we have made.”
