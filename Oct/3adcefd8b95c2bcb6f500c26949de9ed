The EFF is adamant that it supports ANC mayor Oumix Oliphant in Fezile Dabi district municipality. ANC councillors have filed a motion of no confidence to oust Oliphant in support of municipal manager Lindi Molibeli. The feud between the two started when the mayor refused to approve the alleged irregular contract to appoint Molibeli. EFF councillors have endorsed Oliphant due to her stance against corruption. EFF leader in Fezile Dabi council, Malefane Msimanga says they will approach the court against Molibeli accusing her of corruption. “We have decided to file papers, of course, because of Lindi tendencies of being in contempt of court, despite court having dismissed her application with costs. She continues to go to work as if she’s a Municipal manager of Fezile Dabi District Municipality. So we decided to take this issue a step further as Economic Freedom Fighters caucus is Fezile Dabi. She continues to go to work as if nothing has happened. She’s not even in a state of regretting her attitude, her deeds of getting involved in corrupt behaviour.”
