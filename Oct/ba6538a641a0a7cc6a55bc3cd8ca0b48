Police are identifying the bodies of two young children found gagged and with their hands tied behind their backs. The bodies of a 10 and 11-year-old were found in a shallow grave by a passer-by in Slovoville, near Dobsonville and as police continue to investigate the case a family from Kagiso has come forward with a missing persons report. Gauteng Police spokesperson Kay Makhubela says: “It was on Monday when the police were called where two decomposed bodies of two children were found; and when the police arrived they found them tied up on the hands.” Police say they have not received any reports of missing children in the Soweto West area and are not ruling out the possibility that they could have come from outside the area. “We don’t know where they were coming from because around Soweto we have been looking and nobody has reported the incident,” adds Makhubela. It’s unclear at this stage whether the kids are related. The post mortem and DNA testing are still to be conducted. The motive behind the crime also remains unknown. The community of Slovoville is in shock and dismay after the gruesome discovery but information that could help authorities is thin. Community members have been urged to come forward with any information that could assist in the investigation.
