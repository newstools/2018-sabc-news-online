Eight suspects arrested in troubled Westbury on Friday are expected to appear in the Johannesburg Magistrate’s court Monday morning. The arrests were made by the police’s Tactical Response Team. The team was deployed in Westbury last week in reaction to protests that erupted after 45-year-old Heather Peterson was shot dead in the crossfire of an alleged gun battle between gangs. Meanwhile, leaders from so-called coloured communities in Gauteng have announced that there will not be total shutdown on Monday but they will picket throughout the week at various areas in Johannesburg. The leaders have met with a group calling itself the Gauteng Shutdown Co-ordinating Committee, at Eldorado Park in Johannesburg and have decided that a total shutdown will take place on Friday in honour of slain Westbury mother Heather Peterson. Last week residents from Westbury, Ennerdale and Eldorado Park embarked on a shutdown which turned into violent clashes with police. They accuse government of not doing anything about drugs and related crimes in their areas and excluding them from empowerment policies such as Black Economic Empowerment and Affirmative Action.
