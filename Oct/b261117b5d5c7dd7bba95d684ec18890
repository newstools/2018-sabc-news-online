Passenger Rail Agency, Prasa,  says the cost of the damage done to trains in Germiston, east of Johannesburg, Tuesday morning, stands at R6,5 million. Two Metrorail trains were burnt at the Germiston train station. Another train travelling from Germiston to Springs was also torched, damaging only the seats. No injuries were reported in any of the incidents. Over 5000 commuters were affected by train delays as a result of the incidents. Prasa spokesperson Nana Zenani has condemned the incidents, labelling them as acts of criminality. “I mean it’s arson no matter how you look at it. The destruction of state property but also a threat on passengers and our drivers. We are appealing to people to say we have limited trains. Already the services we are running are overburdened and any destruction of one single coach is less trains that we have to serve our people.”
