Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba’s spokesperson, Vuyo Mkhize says the leaked video being ciculated on social media is being used to embarrass the minister. Mkhize has confirmed that the video was stolen from Gigaba’s cellphone and that Gigaba became aware of this just after his appointment as finance minister in March, 2017. Mkhize says the minister took action at the time. He says: “His communication was intercepted illegally some 18 months ago, but he took steps to report attempts to extort and to blackmail him to the country’s law enforcement agencies as well as the intelligence services.” “Recently he became aware that just because he dismissed all of those who attempt to extort and blackmail him whoever was behind those attempts has decided to circulate the material among political figures in the country.” In a series of Tweets, Gigaba apologises to his family and the public for the – quote – ‘pain and embarrassment’ that the circulation of the video will cause.
