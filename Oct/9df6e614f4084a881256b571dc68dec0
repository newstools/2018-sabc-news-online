Political analyst from the University of the Free State, Dr Sethulego Matebesi, says while the relationship between the SACP and the ANC nationally, has improved, the SACP is vocal against corruption in municipalities even if ANC members are implicated. The SACP is supporting the removal of two ANC members in the mayoral committee in the Metsimaholo council at Sasolburg in the Free State following a damning forensic report on corruption. They were replaced by EFF councillors. Matebesi says the situation in Metsimaholo will weaken the ANC in the next coming elections. “We cannot promote a situation where the South African Community Party has folded its arms, when members of the ANC are implicated in corruption. The same applies to the African National Congress, where-ever they are in those municipalities, and they have to take a strong stand against corruption. That will be in digger depth of our leaders that wants to serve people and not their own interest”.
