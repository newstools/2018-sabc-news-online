African National Congress (ANC) Chairperson Gwede Mantashe says it is now up to the National Executive Committee (NEC) to ratify the Integrity Committee’s decisions on the VBS-related matters. He was speaking to the media on the sidelines of the party’s Thuma Mina campaign in Simunye township outside Bekkersrsdal, east of Westonaria in Gauteng. A Reserve Bank forensic report has implicated two senior ANC leaders in Limpopo – Treasurer Danny Msiza and Deputy Chairperson and Vhembe District Mayor Florence Radzilani – in looting at VBS mutual bank. The Integrity Commission earlier recommended that those implicated in the VBS scandal must step aside from leadership positions and all activities of the party. Mantashe says the NEC will probably discuss the matter at its ordinary meeting scheduled for the weekend. Meanwhile, the ANC Youth League in Limpopo has welcomed the decision to let leaders involved in the VBS scandal to step aside from all party activities. The Integrity Committee says the implication of some ANC has damaged the reputation and credibility of the party. The League’s Acting Secretary General Matome Moremi says the mayors of the affected municipalities must also step aside. “It confirms our earlier call as the Youth League that we made last week that things need to be done in consistence with the resolutions of the ANC conference even though they say they were not consulted and everything else we see the Treasurer taking the matter to court, but in the process given the magnitude and the severity of the accusation made we believe that we should allow due process to unfold while he’s stepping aside so that the integrity and standing of the ANC can be salvaged.” Watch the video below for related news:
