Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga is on Tuesday morning visiting the Reiger Park Secondary school, east of Johannesburg, which was rocked by a sexual abuse scandal earlier this year. The school principal was accused of sexually abusing learners after a video and photos of the principal engaged in sexual intercourse in his office went viral on social media. This led to protests by some of the parents. Motshekga’s visit comes as matric learners across the country sit for the English paper one. Basic Education spokesperson Elijah Mhlanga says the department’s readiness for the matric exams will be put to the test. He says: “Today is a very important day because all the full-time candidates in the 2018 matric exams are writing, which is really going to test the readiness of our system.” “We are all awake, running in different directions to monitor and make sure that all our centres are ready, all our invigilators are there and that all the question papers and answer sheets are delivered to the right places at the right time so that everything can run according to the schedule.” Related Videos
