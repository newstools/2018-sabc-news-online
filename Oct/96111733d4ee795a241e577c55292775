Communities from predominantly coloured areas across Johannesburg have started marching to the Gauteng Legislature in Johannesburg where they are expected to hand over their memorandum. They include residents of Ennerdale, Riverlea and Eldorado Park. The march is part of the so-called Blood Friday whose aim is to commemorate those who died in crime and gang related violence.   Westbury mother Heather Peterson is among those who died in gang violence whose death sparked a series of violent protests in the area last week. Black Friday organiser Anthony Williams says: “We want to start at the beginning when our forefathers were slain and murdered and that’s where we’ve got to start. Nobody has accounted, Nobody has atoned. The blood of our forefathers is calling from this land. We’ve got to address it.  That’s what Black Friday is about. It’s about understanding where we are coming from.”   Meanwhile, motorists are advised to avoid the city centre due to the march. WATCH BELOW:
