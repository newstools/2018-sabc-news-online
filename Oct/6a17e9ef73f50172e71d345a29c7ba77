Two Sophiatown police officers are behind bars for alleged murder and defeating the ends of justice. The officers, who were arrested earlier on Thursday, are accused of concealing crucial evidence in the murder of Westbury resident Bradley Sauls, gunned down three months ago. The arrests bring to seven the number of people nabbed for the 21 year old’s killing. The arrests come a  week after the deployment of police reinforcements in the area following violent anti-drug protests in the Johannesburg suburb, sparked by the death of  Heather Pieterson‘s two weeks ago. The 48 year old was caught in gang crossfire. Residents have been implicating police all along. The high profile arrests are seemingly affirming this claim. Five other suspects were arrested earlier for Sauls’ murder. They will appear in court again on 18 October. Click below for more on Westbury:
