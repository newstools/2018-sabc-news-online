The South African Revenue Services Commission of Inquiry continues on Monday morning in Pretoria with testimonies from SARS officials, including Employment Relations Executive, Luther Lebelo. He is making a third appearance before the Commission after he accused the Commission of treating him like a criminal on trial during his first appearance. It has emerged that he had allegedly ignored a legal opinion advising him against pursuing charges against former SARS commissioner Ivan Pillay over the establishment of the so- called rogue unit.
