The Gauteng Shutdown Coordinating Committee representing Coloured communities are preparing to intensify their protests this week. They will be embarking on a march on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange to protest against economic exclusion. The march is expected to begin at 10:00 am from Maud Street in the city centre to the JSE. They say they will make their presence felt in different spaces for the rest of the year until they get a respectable response from President Cyril Ramaphosa and his cabinet. Their main demand is to be included in all socio-economic activities of the country. Spokesperson Anthony Williams says: “It’s really a meeting with leadership and the JSE and the intention is not to have this massive huge march. So it will be in Maud Street up to the JSE and it’s just the first notice we are giving the JSE and all companies that are listed on the JSE. We are giving them seven days to respond to us.” Watch the video below for more:
