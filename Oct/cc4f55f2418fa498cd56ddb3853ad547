Two police officers from the Sophiatown police station are expected to appear in the Johannesburg Magistrate’s Court on Friday. A third suspect will also appear in court. This after the trio was arrested on Wednesday in connection with the murder of Bradley Sauls; one of the victims of the Westbury gang violence gunned down three months ago. This brings the number of suspects arrested for Sauls’ murder to seven. Gauteng Community Safety MEC Sizakele Nkosi-Malobane told the protesting Westbury residents two weeks ago that police that have been accused of corruption and collaborating with gangs would be moved to different police stations, pending internal investigations. Police spokesperson Vish Naidoo has confirmed that the community had named the policemen in question. “Those three suspects are likely to face charges of murder as well as defeating the ends of justice and they’re expected to appear in the Johannesburg Magistrate’s Court and we’re hoping to also have them remanded in custody until the 18th of October when they can reappear with the initial four suspects. I think it’s safe to say that because we’ve arrested the two.” Meanwhile, Westbury residents have welcomed the arrest of the two police officers. Residents have expressed their satisfaction. “I’m glad the arrest has happened. The same keeps on coming up not from one person but from several people in the community,” says one resident. Another resident says: “We are happy something had been done about it. The police are doing their work now right I am very proud of them and I am very happy.” Watch the video below for related news:
