Wednesday is the deadline for the Gauteng Education Department to place the outstanding 13 000 Grades 1 and 8 learners in schools for the 2019 academic year. The Department says it has since removed about 21 000 applicants from its system who did not submit outstanding documentation despite continuous requests. The Department’s Steve Mabona is confident they will meet the midnight deadline to place all the remaining 13 000 learners. “We can commit that probably by midnight, we should have placed everyone. We are monitoring the situation very closely just to ensure our district offices and management are aware of what is happening.  We are meeting everyday just to check on the numbers and check on what it is we can do to make sure everyone is placed.” Click video below:
