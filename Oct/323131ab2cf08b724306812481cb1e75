With just two days to go before Cape Town Mayor Patricia de LilleÂ is scheduled to leave office, she will address the Cape Town Press Club on Monday. However, in recent days she has refused to indicate whether she will indeed step down from her position on Wednesday. This comes after the Cape Town City Council adopted two reports last week recommending disciplinary action, including criminal investigations, against those implicated in corruption and maladministration. One of the reports alleges that De Lille could have been involved in covering up corruption. She has denied this. Watch related videos:
