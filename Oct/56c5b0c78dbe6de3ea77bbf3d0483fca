Democratic Alliance (DA) leader Mmusi Maimane says when the party is in power, corruption and poor service delivery will be the thing of the past. Maimane was addressing residents of Kroonstad, as part of the Team One South Africa launch in the Free State. Issues of a high unemployment rate and poor service delivery were the order of the day. Residents complained about poor services at the Boitumelo Regional Hospital. They are however, hopeful that the DA will make changes in governance. “We want people to get houses, jobs and we want electricity to stop going down,” says one of the residents. Maimane has criticised the way Free State is governed. He says the provincial government has done nothing to address corruption during and after Ace Magashule’s tenure citing the controversial multimillion Vrede Dairy Project. “The truth of the matter is that, that report cannot be accepted. That is why we are opposing it and we will make sure the  public protector is removed. We must get a report that will finally say Ace Magashule stole the money in Vrede and they must pay back that money so that we can give it back to the people.” Maimane promised residents that the DA will bring change in their community. “Ours is to bring change, change that delivers services that create jobs. When the DA is in government unemployment goes down, corruption goes down, jobs go up and clean government goes up. We must bring change.” The party says when in power it will also scrap the fuel levy and ensure electricity remains affordable.  Makgala Masiteng
