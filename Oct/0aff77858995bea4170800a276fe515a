Limpopo’s African National Congress (ANC) five top officials will discuss the involvement of its senior members in the VBS Mutual Bank heist in Polokwane, on Monday. Two senior officials – deputy chairperson and Vhembe district executive mayor – Florence Radzilani and Treasurer Danny Msiza are deeply implicated in the VBS scandal. ANC spokesperson Donald Selamolela says the meeting is a precursor to the ANC’s Provincial Working Committee (PWC) and the Provincial Executive Committee (PEC). “ANC officials meet Monday to reflect on all societal issues that affect our people and VBS is one of the hot issues currently impacting on the lives of our people and will obviously be discussed by the African National Congress,” adds Selamolela.
