The six men charged with attempted murder and kidnapping during recent violent protests in Bloemhof have been released on bail of R1000 each. The community picketed outside the Bloemhof Magistrate’s Court, calling for the release of the men, known to be local taxi drivers. The courtroom was packed to capacity as the community called for the six men to be released and continued to call for the charges to be dropped. Vice Chairperson of the Lekwa Teemane Taxi Association, Petrus Qankase says they welcome the granting of bail. “We are not happy that the blame is now on taxi drivers alone when the community was also involved.” The community has called on the South African National Defense Force (SANDF) to intervene. Community members believe this is the only way to eradicate gangs in their communities. “I’m calling on the police to discipline these gang members. This needs to stop because our children are killing each other.” Three people died when taxi operators and the community waged a war against gang members in the area three weeks ago. The case has been postponed to October 29th. Meanwhile, a 26-year-old woman was found murdered at the railway line on Wednesday. A man believed to be her ex-boyfriend has been arrested.
