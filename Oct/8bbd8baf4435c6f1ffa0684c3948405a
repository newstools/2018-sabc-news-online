President Cyril Ramaphosa has declined to answer journalists’ questions about the position of Finance Minister Nhlanhla Nene, whose future is in doubt after he admitted to meetings with the Guptas. Ramaphosa was speaking at the launch of a new stamp bearing his image at his Tuynhuis office in Cape Town. The launch of the R4.20  stamp marks World Post Day. Ramaphosa says the Post Office continues to play an important role in the lives of people, even as technological advances are being made in communications. “The Post Office is poised to deliver new goods new services as it moves on and I’ve no doubt that as it moves on as it creates new services it will also be creating new jobs because we are now in that situation where we’ve got in and everyone and society to talk no longer about lamenting complaints about lack of jobs and all that.” Meanwhile, the Public Protector’s office has confirmed that it will look into a request by the Democratic Alliance to investigate  Minister of Finance Nhlanhla Nene. The party wants Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane to determine whether Nene breached the executive code of ethics and exposed himself to a conflict between his official responsibilities and private interests when he was deputy finance minister and later finance minister
