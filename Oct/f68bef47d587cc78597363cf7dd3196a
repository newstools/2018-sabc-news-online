Residents of SST informal settlement in Town Two Khayelitsha on the Cape Flats have started rebuilding their shacks. A fire destroyed more than 300 homes in the area on Saturday leaving more than a 1000 people destitute. Even though most matric learners started their final exams on Monday but some learners in the area were unable to go to school. The situation is dire, with many not knowing where they will sleep for the night or whether they will have a meal. In the early hours of Saturday morning, residents were woken up by screams and pleas for them to evacuate their homes. A strong South Easterly wind fanned the blaze uncontrollably. For the last couple of days, affected residents were being accommodated by friends and family in nearby areas. Resident Sivuyile Mfabi says:”They are taking very long and most of the time they deliver the material very late. You have to take the material and take it in a place where you can store it and then come back in the morning only to find out you have lost your spot as well.” Women and children have been the hardest hit. The Department of Social Development, the city of Cape Town, and concerned citizens and other organisations are also assisting those affected. CLICK VIDEO BELOW:
