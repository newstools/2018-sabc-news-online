The United States Secret Service is investigating explosive devices sent in the mail to former President Barack Obama and the home of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. The devices are thought to be similar to the one sent to the home of billionaire philanthropist George Soros earlier this week. The Secret Service said in a statement that it had intercepted two suspicious packages addressed to Secret Service protectees. The mailed devices were addressed to Mrs Clinton in Westchester County, north of New York City, where she has a home and a second package was addressed to Mr Obama in Washington DC. The statement says the packages were immediately identified during routine mail screening procedures as potential explosive devices and were appropriately handled as such. This as a suspicious device has also now led to the evacuation of Time Warner Center, the home of CNN in New York City. The NYPD’s bomb squad is on the scene with reports that a suspicious package has also now been intercepted at the White House, which condemned what it called attempted violent attacks made against Clinton and Obama, labeling them as “terrorizing acts” and denouncing them as despicable.
