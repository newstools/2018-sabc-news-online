Religious Leaders Council General Secretary and CEO of the Rhema Bible Church, Pastor Giet Khoza, says they feel ashamed following the evidence that was heard at Pastor Timothy Omotoso’s court case in Port Elizabeth. The Jesus Dominion International Church pastor allegedly sexually groomed Cheryl Zondi and raped her from the age of 14. Several other girls whom Omotoso abused, are also expected to testify about their ordeal at the hands of the pastor. The ANC Women’s League is among those fighting to have the church closed. Khoza says there should be a standard by which religious leaders are held accountable. “It shouldn’t be happening… it’s a very embarrassing experience, it’s on our doorstep, as church leaders and religious leaders we can’t ignore it… we have to confront it. We want to go to parliament; parliament must sort of give us some kind of teeth. At the moment it’s a nightmare, it’s a mess out there, if its not dog meat its sexual harassment. So yes – with us we want every religious leader or a Pastor or an Imam or Reverend to be held to a certain standard.”
