ANC Deputy Secretary-General Jessie Duarte says the party is preparing its own submission in response to the banking sector’s testimony to the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture. Duarte was speaking in Cape Town on Wednesday at a media briefing on the appointment of Tito Mboweni as Finance Minister. Some of the banks told the commission about how senior ANC officials attempted to intervene after the bank accounts of the Guptas were closed. Standard Bank is one of the institutions that said it attended a meeting in which the ANC officials allegedly tried to stop the bank from closing the Gupta bank accounts. Duarte says the ANC has decided to make a submission in response to what the banking sector had said. She says, “We also have our own set of questions to all the banks. That is the submission that we are working on at the moment. Hopefully, when the commission rises again we will discuss when we will be able to go and make our submission in response. I think that’s what this commission is about. It is to give the country an opportunity to hear all sides; not just one perspective.”
