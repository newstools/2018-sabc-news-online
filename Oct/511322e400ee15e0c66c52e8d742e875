The case of human trafficking accused, Pastor Timothy Omotoso underway at the High Court in Port Elizabeth has been briefly adjourned. This is to allow defence advocate Peter Daubermann time to study new particulars and Judge Mandela Makaula time to familiarise himself with these particulars. This comes after the judge dismissed Daubermannâ€™s application to have some of the 63 main charges withdrawn. On Monday Daubermann argued that the charge sheet was improperly compiled as it lacked information such as time, place and nature of the alleged offences. Omotoso and two co-accused are facing charges of racketeering, human trafficking, sexual assault and rape.
