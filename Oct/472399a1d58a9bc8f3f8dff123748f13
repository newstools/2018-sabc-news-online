The Independent Police Investigative Directorate (IPID)  has arrested eight police officers for the murder of a Nigerian national, Ibrahim Badmus who was tortured and murdered in Vanderbijlpark on the Vaal in October 2017. On Friday, the IPID arrested six male and two female officers. They are expected to appear in the Vanderbijlpark Magistrates Court on Monday on charges of murder and torture. The IPID Spokesperson Moses Dlamini says, “It’s alleged that in October 2017, the police officers interrogated the deceased and suffocated him resulting in his death. According to the police, they had found drugs on the deceased but this was a false story to cover up the torture and murder. The post-mortem was conducted by two pathologists and it confirmed that the deceased was indeed tortured.” Meanwhile, three suspects have been arrested in connection with an attack on a Durban mosque as well as a spate of incidents where explosive devices were placed at shops in the metro. These incidents took place between March and August 2018. Three men were attacked at a Mosque in Ottawa near Verulam north of Durban in May. One person died in the attack, while two others were seriously injured. Police Minister Bheki Cele says the arrested suspects are likely to face charges of murder, the contravention of the Explosives Act and arson. Cele says they will appear in court early next week.
