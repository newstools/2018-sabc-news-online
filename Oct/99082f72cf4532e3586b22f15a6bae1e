The Fetakgomo -Tubatse municipal council sitting held at Apel outside Burgersfort collapsed due to disruptions on Tuesday night. Opposition parties –  the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), Democratic Alliance (DA), SADA and members of the South African Municipal Workers Union (Samwu) were demanding the removal of the mayor and senior officials for their alleged involvement in investing municipal funds in VBS. Speaking during the sitting EFF councillor Kgotatso Mogowane had this to say: “The mayor must go; the head of finance must go. We’re not a faction of the ANC where we are going to please other comrades over the other. We’re fighting corruption here, how are we going to get our money back from VBS?” The Fetakgomo-Tubatse municipal council sitting at Apel outside Burgersfort in Limpopo has degenerated into chaos. The sitting was expected to debate the R250-million  that the municipality deposited in VBS mutual bank. — SAfm news (@SAfmnews) October 30, 2018
