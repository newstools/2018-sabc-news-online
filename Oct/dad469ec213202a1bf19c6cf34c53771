Funeral proceedings for the woman who was killed in cross-fire in Westbury, west of Johannesburg, are expected to get under way on Saturday morning. Heather Peterson died last week during alleged gang violence in the area. Her death led to the shutdown of Wesbury in the days after her passing with various government officials visiting the area. Petersonâ€™s ten-year-old relative was critically injured in the incident. Community members called for Police Minister, Bheki Cele, to address them. Cele heeded the call last week and deployed a Tactical Response Team in the area. The mother of four was remembered by her family and community in a memorial service on Wednesday.
