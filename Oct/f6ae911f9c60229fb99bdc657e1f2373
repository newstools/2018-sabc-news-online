Businessman and double-murder accused, Rameez Patel will appear at the Polokwane Magistrate’s Court in Limpopo on Thursday. Patel is accused of killing his 51-year-old mother Mahajeen Banu-Patel in September last year. The matter against Patel in relation to his mother has been ongoing since 2017 making it over a year since the suspect was arrested. His application for leave to appeal judgement after his bail was denied has been dismissed. His previous defence attorney, Tumi Mokoena has been removed permanently from all of Patel’s cases. He is expected to be represented by a new legal team led by Johan Engelbrecht. Patel’s murder trial where he is accused of killing his wife, Fatima Patel will continue in November.
