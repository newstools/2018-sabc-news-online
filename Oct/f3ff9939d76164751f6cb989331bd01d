Authorities say veldfires in the Outeniqua Mountains above George in the Southern Cape are still active. The fires started earlier this week in the area of Herold. Ground and aerial teams are in the area trying to control the fires. George is enveloped in smoke and ash as the fire rages. Authorities say there is no danger to residents and infrastructure at this stage. New fires broke out close to the Outeniqua Pass, forcing its closure. Traffic was diverted to the Robinson Pass which links Oudtshoorn and Mossel Bay. Meanwhile, a memorial service has been held for fire pilot, Nico Heyns. He was killed in a helicopter crash while fighting fires near Heildelberg this week. Regarded as a hero, Heyns played a big part in helping douse the Knysna fires in June last year.
