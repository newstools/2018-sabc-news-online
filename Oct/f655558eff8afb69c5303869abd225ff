Police believe their operations in Westbury, West of Johannesburg, are yielding results and they have vowed to work relentlessly to ensure they rid the township of drugs and gangsterism. Just this week, 10 people were arrested and charged for possession and dealing in drugs. They appeared in the Johannesburg Magistrate’s Court on Wednesday. Following the murder of Westbury mother, Heather Peterson, earlier in October a large police contingent was deployed to the township to help deal with drugs and gang-related violence. “As the police, we will continue with this operation that is aimed at ensuring that Westbury becomes a drug-free suburb and gangsters are exposed and arrested. Various police units deployed in Westbury and surroundings are instrumental in the arrests that are made in Westbury,” says Gauteng Police Spokesperson Mavela Masondo.
