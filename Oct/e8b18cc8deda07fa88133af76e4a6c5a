The Democratic Alliance (DA) in the North West says nothing has changed in the province in the 100 days since Premier Job Mokgoro took over in June this year. He took over from Supra Mahumapelo who resigned in May amid violent protests against his leadership and national government’s decision to place several provincial departments under administration. The DA briefed the media in Mahikeng after giving Mokgoro a score below five out of 10 for general performance. DA provincial leader, Joe Macgluwa says, “Ever since his inauguration, he has never been once in a legislature sitting where it really matters. So, it is clear that he has no vision and it also leaves us with questions about whether the premier of the North West has any idea what is transpiring.” The North West premier’s office says it will respond to the DA at the appropriate time. Mokgoro’s spokesperson, Vuyisile Ngesi says, “The provincial government through the premier himself will at the right time be able to make pronouncements on all the work done and progress made since Premier Mokgoro assumed duty around 22nd of June this year.”
