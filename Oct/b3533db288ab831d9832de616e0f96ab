The Gauteng Shutdown Coordinating Committee says it expects members of 19 predominantly coloured areas to join their Blood Friday commemoration in Johannesburg. The group says residents of the areas will gather at the Mary Fitzgerald Square to draw attention to crime and what they call economic exclusion in their communities. It says they will hand a memorandum to Gauteng Premier David Makhura in which they demand action. The community of Eldorado Park, however, says it will not participate in the shutdown and will instead mobilise in a different way. A ward councillor in the area, Fazel Jaffer says while they share the sentiments of the protesters, they do not agree with their approach. “We do not agree with the violence, shutting down of streets, burning of tyres and the burning of public and private property. We want to make Eldorado great again. We had a meeting with the community and there was overall agreement that we do not support any shutdown and we will now make Eldorado great again. So we are painting the area, cleaning the community and we’re also trying to make the schools part of it so that they can take pride in the area.” Watch the video below for related news:
