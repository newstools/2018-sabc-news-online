The South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) says it has implemented the court order to end the contract of Cash Paymaster Services (CPS) in paying out social grants. From Monday, the South African Post Office officially took over the payment of social grants and a new Sassa gold card is now in use. Beneficiaries will now get their full grants without incurring additional charges. SASSA spokesperson Paseka Letsatsi says, “The Minister of Social development earlier this year made it very clear that come end of September, she is not prepared to go to Constitutional Court to ask for an extension and we have lived by this particular decision of the minister. The contract between the Sassa and CPS ended on September 30 as per the ConCourt judgment. So, we can safely say the ConCourt judgment has been implemented.”
