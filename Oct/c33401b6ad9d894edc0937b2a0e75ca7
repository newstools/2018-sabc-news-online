One person has died and three others are in hospital after over 50 shacks caught fire at Platic View 2 informal settlement near the Woodlands Mall in Pretoria East. The fire broke out in the early hours of Monday morning. At the weekend, another informal settlement in the same area also caught fire, leaving more than 500 people homeless. Tshwane Metro Emergency Services’ Johan Pieterse says the three people in hospital suffered smoke inhalation. He says the fire has been extinguished. “We are busy monitoring the situation and assisting the people with necessary relief items,” says Pieterse.
