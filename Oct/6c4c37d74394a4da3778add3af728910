Civil society organisation, #UniteBehind has called on the situation with the trains in South Africa to be declared a national disaster. This after two trains were torched at the Cape Town Train Station on Tuesday. Six carriages were destroyed in the incident. Prasa says damage to trains in the Western Cape have exceeded more than R450 million due to continued arson attacks. #UniteBehind organiser Zukiswa Vuka, says they are also calling for an investigation to be launched into the attacks. Currently four platforms remain out of commission at the Cape Town Station following Tuesday’s incident. Metrorail spokesperson, Riana Scott, says trains are operating normally at all other platforms. Scott says technicians will on Wednesday inspect the scene but has informed commuters that it will take some time to open the affected platforms. Meanwhile, Transport Minister Blade Nzimande says the torching of trains needs proper investigation. He says: “It’s Tranport Month and the portfolio committee is meeting Prasa then we have these attacks. Clearly criminals are sending a message that you may be talking to the portfolio committee but we will continue vandalising Prasa public property.” Related video
