The Vhembe District Municipality in Limpopo has suspended the Municipal Manager Reuben Rambado and Chief Financial Officer Nyiko Machava over the VBS scandal. The municipality has invested R300 million in the bank. This was announced during a special council sitting in Thohoyandou. Municipal workers have been demonstrating during the day demanding the recall of Executive Mayor Florence Radzilani, and the suspension of the Member of Mayoral Committee on Finance Rudzani Ludere and two other officials. “The Municipal Manager and the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) have been put on suspension. As to what happens with the Executive Mayor and anyone politically, the ANC is clear to say that anyone implicated from the police level will be referred to the integrity commission. We do not know as for now as to how many are implicated or who will be implicated,” says ANC Regional Secretary Anderson Mudunungwi. Rambado has threatened to spill the beans. He says he will name other people involved in the VBS scandal. Click below for more on the story:
