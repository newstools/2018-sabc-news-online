Over 3 000 women employed in mining gathered in Rustenburg in the North West over the weekend to highlight the abuse and discomfort of working in the male dominated sector. The plight and safety of women miners in the Rustenburg platinum belt remains a pressing concern, six years after the tragic rape and murder of Pinky Mosiane at Anglo Platinum’s Khomanani mine, and five years after the fatal attack on Cynthia Setuke at Aquarius Platinum’s Kwezi Shaft. To counter these difficulties the Women in Mining Rustenburg Tripartite Forum was formed to encourage women to speak out on harassment. Its chairperson is Jacqueline Dibetsoe says: “When we joined this industry men occupied most of the senior positions and we had to report to them. So out of desperation for opportunities some of these women would sell their bodies, and some would be victims of sexual harassment underground as a way to get positions.” Lerato Tsele of the Mining Council South Africa, formerly known as the Chamber of Mines, says employers are making an effort to address the challenges faced by women in the sector. “There were mines that didn’t have the basic facilities, change rooms for females and ablution facilities like bathrooms and toilets for females. And since now we are introducing more and more of them, employers are a availing those facilities. So, yeah, we are, and then PPE, we know nobody can do any work in any mine when they are not wearing appropriate PPE. So, they’ve had to go and make sure they get the right PPE that fit their female physique.” WATCH BELOW:
