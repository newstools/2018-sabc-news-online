Broadcaster Rowena Baird’s funeral will be held on Saturday 13 October 2018 at St. George’s Anglican Church in Parktown, Johannesburg at 7am. Rowena passed away peacefully on Friday 5 October at home surrounded by her loved ones. Her journey with cancer ended after being diagnosed with colon cancer in 2014. The cancer had spread to her lungs, liver and kidneys. Rowie as she was affectionately known leaves behind her sister Michelle, son Vuyo, granddaughter Khanya, nieces and nephews. The SABC says it is saddened by the passing of Rowena Baird. SABC spokesperson Neo Momodu says Baird played a meaningful role in assisting the public broadcaster to deliver on its mandate of keeping South African citizens informed and entertained. Baird started her broadcasting career in the 1980s at Radio Bop in Mahikeng in the former Bophuthatswana, now North West. She spent time at a variety of radio stations over the years including on Radio 2000, Channel Africa and Metro FM. These were Baird’s last words when she left SAfm not long ago. “Thanks to the listeners. Thanks to you for having made my career what it was, for having made it so worthwhile and there’s no way that I couldn’t have come back to say a special thank you and a special good bye to you. I love you with every fibre of my being, and thank you.”
