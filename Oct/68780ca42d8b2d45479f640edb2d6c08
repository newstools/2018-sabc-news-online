Westbury residents, west of Johannesburg have threatened to embark on a total shutdown again on Thursday ahead of the second visit by Police Minister Bheki Cele. The minister visited the area on Tuesday and promised to deploy a Tactical Response Team (TRT). However on Wednesday, there were no signs of the unit in the area. A group of Gauteng leaders have called on so-called coloured areas to embark on total shutdowns of their areas from today. They’ve also called for the immediate release of those arrested in the Westbury protests. They’ve accused the Police Minister of failing to deal decisively with what they call the rot at local police stations. The residents have been protesting against drugs and other forms of crimes in the area. The protest which started on Friday was sparked by an alleged gang-related shooting which claimed the life of a woman and left a child in a critical condition.
