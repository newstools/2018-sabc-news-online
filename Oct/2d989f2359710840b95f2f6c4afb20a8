The SABC has launched a forensic investigation into allegations of sexual misconduct at PBS station Lotus FM.  According to reports, some staff including certain freelancers have compiled a dossier leveling a number of serious accusations against a few senior managers. These include sex-for-jobs allegations and a plot to purposefully destroy the station in order to privately acquire it from the SABC. Meanwhile this week a former freelancer at the station filed a civil defamation claim against another former employee for allegedly soliciting and then distributing private videos containing sexual content. SABC spokesperson, Neo Mamodu, says they are trying to bring stability to the radio station. “The SABC is aware of the challenges facing Lotus FM and we have put in place definite steps to try and bring stability to the station and these include a forensic investigation that is currently underway and this forensic investigation we hope will shed light into the ferocity of the challenges and claims made at the station and actually get recommendation to management on a way forward.”
