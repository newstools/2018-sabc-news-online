Nkosi Mandla Mandela has wished former President FW de Klerk a speedy recovery. De Klerk was admitted to a Cape Town hospital on Friday. Mandla Mandela, grandson of former President Nelson Mandela, referred to De Klerk’s praise for Madiba during South Africa’s transition from apartheid to democracy. He says De Klerk’s words moved many to tears and his deep regard for the Father of the Nation was evident and palpable. De Klerk described Madiba as a “man of principle and an extraordinary statesman and servant of the people”. Mandela says De Klerk’s contribution to South Africa’s transition to democracy will be remembered for generations to come. De Klerk was admitted due to an abnormal collection of air in the pleural space between his lung and chest wall. The statesman has since been treated and is expected to be discharged next week.
