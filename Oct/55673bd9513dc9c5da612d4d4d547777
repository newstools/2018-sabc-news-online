Facebook introduced a third-party fact-checking programme to try and combat the issue of fake news and misleading content. The programme will help assess the accuracy of news in South Africa and reduce the spread of misinformation, while improving the quality of news people find on its platform. The initiative is in partnership with Africa Check and AFP. Senior researcher at Africa Check, Kate Wilkinson explains how the Facebook fake news check works.
