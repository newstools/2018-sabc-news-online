An exhibition of an animal believed to be part of the giraffe family which once roamed the area of the now West Coast Fossil Park close to Langebaan, Western Cape millions of years ago has been unveiled. The short-neck long horned giraffe exhibition was unveiled at the official opening at the Visitors Centre at the West Coast Fossil Park, which is about 120 kilometers outside Cape Town. The Lotto contributed R67 million towards the construction of the centre. Manager of the West Coast Fossil Park Pippa Haarhoff says fossilised remains of over 500 of the species have been found. “It’s an extinct branch if you like of the giraffe family – and is named Hendi Sivathere…they were first discovered in India that’s where the Siva comes from. It was an enormous animal weighing up to 2 000 kilograms and it’s the most common herbivore that has been discovered here.
