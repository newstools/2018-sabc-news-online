Western Cape MEC for Human Settlements, Bonginkosi Madikizela, says his department is focusing on the resettlement of people whose informal dwellings were destroyed in fire that broke out in Khayelitsha in the early hours of Saturday morning. One person died in the blaze and more than 300 structures destroyed, leaving more than 1 300 displaced. The City of Cape Town has cleared the rubble from the area and is delivering building material to the victims. Madikizela explains,“We must deal with the resettlement of the families who were affected. There were two areas affected and we must talk about the long term plan to deal with these fires, because we must be ready to deal with it, as it is unfortunate.”
