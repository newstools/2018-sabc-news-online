Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) Deputy President Floyd Shivambu has denied receiving R10 million from VBS Mutual Bank. Shivambu released a statement earlier on Saturday, saying he has no dealings with the bank, and that any attempts to draw his party into the saga, are for cheap political points.  He has dismissed as Fake News that his younger brother, Brian, funneled R10 million through Sgameka projects into his bank account.  Brian was implicated in a report that showed massive looting of VBS, which he has since denied being part of. “I never received anything from VBS or my brother or anyone. The allegations that were published in one of the online publications are not a reflection of reality. I have never been involved in any form of looting or heist in VBS,” says Shivambu.
