The Transnet board says it will be announcing a new acting Chief Executive before the end of this week to replace Siyabonga Gama. Gama was fired as Transnet CEO this weekend despite a labour court ruling that the dispute between him and Transnet be taken to arbitration. It is not clear if Gama will be challenging his dismissal in court. The board cited lack of trust and confidence among reasons cited for terminating Gama’s employment. “The board is meeting right now and in fact I’m speaking to you from Transnet. We will announce depending on when we finish the matters and every necessary step. But by the end of the week, we will have announced who will be the acting person in addition to having started with the process to recruit a new Chief Executive for Transnet Group,” says Transnet board member Mpho Letlape.
