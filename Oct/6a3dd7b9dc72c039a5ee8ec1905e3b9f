The Minister of Health, Dr Aaron Motsoaledi, will on Tuesday evening receive two prestigious Kochon Prizes, the Health Department has said. The Award Ceremony will be held at The Hague, in the Netherlands, from 18h00 South African time. Motsoaledi will receive the first prize in his individual capacity for his role and political leadership in fight against Tuberculosis (TB) globally. The second prize, which he will share with the Right Honourable Nick Hebert, Member of Parliament in the United Kingdom, will be in their capacity as co-chairs of the Global TB Caucus of members of parliament from all over the world. The Kochon Prize is awarded annually to individuals and/or organisations that have made a significant contribution to combating TB either in their countries or globally. The Kochon Prize was established in 2006 in honour of the late Chairman Chong-Kun Lee, founder of the Chong Kun Dang Pharmaceutical Corporation and Kochon Foundation in Korea. Lee was committed throughout his career to improving access to low-cost lifesaving antibiotics and anti-TB drugs. READ FULL STATEMENT FROM HEALTH DEPARTMENT:
