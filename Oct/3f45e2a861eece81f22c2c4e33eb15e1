The ANC’s January 8 Statement rally will be held in KwaZulu-Natal. The party will also on the same day unveil its election manifesto. President Cyril Ramaphosa told this to party volunteers who braved inclement weather conditions and walked with him at Esikhaleni Township outside Empangeni on the north coast. He will also hand over 4 586 hectares of land to the community of KwaMkhwanazi. The community was disposed of their land before the Native Land Act of 1913. Ramaphosa thanked the community for being prepared to host the ANC January 8 rally. He says: “That is going to be the biggest rally where we will be presenting the manifesto. There is no great honour in the ANC for a province to be given that responsibility of not only hosting the January 8 rally but to be hosting the January 8th where we will launch the manifesto.”
