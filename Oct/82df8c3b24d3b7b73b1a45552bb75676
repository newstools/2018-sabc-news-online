The FW De Klerk Foundation has applauded the work of the retired US Assistant Secretary of State for Africa, Ambassador Herman J. Cohen. Cohen worked with two of country’s former Presidents, Nelson Mandela and FW De Klerk during the time when South Africa was transitioning into a non-racial democracy. His book ‘ The Mind of the African Strongman: Conversation with Dictators, Statesmen and Father Figures’ was launched in Cape Town on Friday. Cohen gives an account of his private conversations with various African heads of state. Chairman of The FW De Klerk Foundation Dave Steward explains, “He was also Assistance Secretary of State from 1989 to 1993 at the critical phase of South Africa’s own transition to non-racial democracy. He was helpful and supportive of our process, but at the end of the day it was a South African home-grown process. The strengths of our experience was that this was made in South Africa for South Africans by South Africans.”
