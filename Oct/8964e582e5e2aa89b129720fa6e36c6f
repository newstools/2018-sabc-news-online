Eastern Cape Education MEC Mandla Makupula has been hailed as an education hero by the minister of Basic Education, Angie Motshekga. She was one of the keynote speakers at Makhuphula’s provincial official funeral at the Christian Centre in East London. Makupula died after a long illness. Motshekga praised Makupula saying she has not had to deal with any reports of theft or corruption linking him. The minister described Makupula as person who loved his province. She said he was a person who could listen because of his humility, and that he was a very insightful and knowledgeable MEC who was passionate about education. “Makupula was indeed one of a kind. And we all agree that we are poorer without him. In his character he was a true gentleman. It did not matter how far he came, he always remained humble. But what also stood out was that Makupula was a teacher to the core. He enjoyed everything that education and teaching gave….he loved the music, sport, teaching – he just ate and dreamt education at all times,” said Motshekga.

The Minister said that MEC Makupula would have been among the leading voices against children, and especially young girls being groomed for sexual pleasures. South African Communist Party (SACP) General secretary Dr Blade Nzimande also paid tribute to Makupula, saying he was a true communist and also acknowledging his passion for education. “We must not only talk about our comrades in the past tense. Comrade Mandla died with his boots on, rebuilding this country and had one of the most difficult portfolios – education in the EC had been the most challenging.”
