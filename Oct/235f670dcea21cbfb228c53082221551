The Press Council of South Africa on Tuesday announced the resignation of Press Ombud, Johan Retief after more than nine years in the office. Retief will vacate the position early next year. “The reason for my resignation is purely personal. After nine years in this position, I believe that I now owe it to myself to take a break, to move back to my Heimat, and to spend some quality time with my loved ones. “I thank the Press Council for the opportunity to serve its worthy cause in this capacity. I am especially appreciative of the faith and trust it has put in me over the years, and of Council’s attitude towards me that has always been positive, caring and accommodating. I trust that the Press Council will continue the excellent work they are doing in service of our fledgling democracy and in promoting press freedom.”
