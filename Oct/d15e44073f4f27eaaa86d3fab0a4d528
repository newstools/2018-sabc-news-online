The N3 has been closed near Mooi River in the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands after a head-on collision between a truck and a minibus taxi in the early hours of Thursday morning. Road Traffic Inspectorate spokesperson Zinhle Mali said one person died and 13 others were seriously injured. She said it is believed that the driver of the truck that was travelling towards Johannesburg, lost control of the vehicle at Mount West and veered across the centre median. Mali says, “The injured were taken to Edendale and Greys Hospital. One count of culpable homicide is being investigated. At the moment we have closed the road for recovery and maybe resuscitation of other patients on scene. We are busy diverting at Mooi River.”
