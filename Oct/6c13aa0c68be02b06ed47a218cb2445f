Finance Minister Nhlanhla Nene has described a meeting with former Deputy Finance minister, Mcebisi Jonas in October 2015 regarding the Gupta family’s knowledge of the cabinet reshuffle that sent the rand into freefall. Speaking during the State Capture commission of inquiry in Parktown, Johannesburg, Nene says Jonas told him that the Guptas were aware of a cabinet reshuffle that year, and that he was to be removed as Finance minister. Jonas has famously spoken of the meeting with the Guptas, where he was offered a R600 million bribe for the position. Former President Jacob Zuma fired Nene, and replaced him with the little known Des Van Rooyen. Nene say there were already rumours circulating in the media about an imminent cabinet reshuffle,  and his name was among the ministers who were reported to be due for removal, but he paid no regard to these rumours. “Jonas then informed me that the Guptas were aware of this intended reshuffle and they had informed him that they were influential in the removal of certain ministers. I recall saying to him, ‘who are they to offer you the job of minister?’ I suggested to him that I resign perhaps, but he pointed out that I should continue to hold the line at Treasury, and not give in to these threats.” Watch the Commission hearings below:
