African National Congress (ANC) stalwart and retired diplomat, Moss Chikane passed away on Wednesday night. Sixty-nine- year-old, Chikane had been unwell for some time and spent time in and out of hospital. He was elected as a Member of Parliament in 1994 following South Africa’s first democratic elections. In 2005, Chikane was appointed as the country’s Ambassador to Germany and in 2010 he was posted to Zambia where he also served a full term as Ambassador. The struggle stalwart played a prominent role in the liberation struggle and was one of the key leaders of the United Democratic Front (UDF). In 1988, Chikane was convicted of treason along with former North West Premier, Popo Molefe, Congress of the People leader, Mosioua Lekota and former UDF leader, Tom Manthata. He is survived by five sons, a daughter, three brothers and four sisters. Funeral arrangements will be announced in due course.
