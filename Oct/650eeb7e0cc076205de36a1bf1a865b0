The world’s longest serving Foreign Affairs Minister, Pik Botha will be given a dignified send-off on Tuesday in Pretoria. Botha will be laid to rest  in the Heatherdale cemetery in Pretoria North. His family however says they have no knowledge of an offer for a state funeral by government. Botha passed away on the 12 of October after being hospitalised for heart problems. Born in 27th April 1932, Roelof Frederik Botha was nicknamed Pik, a shortened version of the name Pikkewyn which in English means penguin. His son says he got the name as a young boy from a guest who remarked that he looked like a penguin. This, after his mother dressed him up during a special occasion, in a black suit and a white shirt that was too small. Botha says his father advocated love for the country. Says Dr Roelof Botha: “That’s what this country needs desperately right now is people that are prepared to not try to stir conflict.” Botha served as a Foreign Affairs minister under three apartheid Prime Ministers. He was described by some as a ‘good man working for a bad government’. He had on several occasions contended with the hard-line government of President PW Botha. He was reprimanded in 1986 after saying that the country could one day be ruled by a black president. But he didn’t cower from adding his voice on the political landscape change in 1990.
