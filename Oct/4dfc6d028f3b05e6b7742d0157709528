The African National Congress (ANC) in Gauteng says it will lead what it calls a People’s March to the Union Buildings in Pretoria on Friday. The party says the march is against e-tolls, the recent fuel hikes, increases in VAT, escalating data costs and the poor state of public transport. The march will be preceded by a seminar which will explore various proposals on the alternative funding models for the e-tolls and other big public transport infrastructure. Protests will be held at major e-toll gantries to express dissatisfaction with the system. ANC Gauteng PEC member Kgosientsho Ramokgopa says, “What the march simply seeks to do is to demonstrate the scale and gravity of the problem by ensuring we bring as many people as possible to come and express their discontent.  And that this is not an ANC issue is an issue of public interest. And that’s why we are drawing on a broad spectrum of social actors and stakeholders.” WATCH RELATED VIDEO:
