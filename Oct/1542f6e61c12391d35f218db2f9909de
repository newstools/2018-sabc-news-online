A 45-year old Phoenix triple murder suspect will spend another seven days in custody before he can make a formal bail application. On Tuesday the state added a charge of robbery to the three murder charges Colin Pillay faces. He appeared in the Verulam Magistrate’s Court. Protesters vented their anger outside court. They do not want who they call “a murderer”, to be released on bail. Inside court, Colin Pillay sat motionless in the dock. He is charged with the murder of Janelle Govindasamy  and her two daughters Rackelle and Denisha. Their bodies were found in their flat in Phoenix last month. The State Prosecutor Rakesh Singh told the court that they have added a charge of robbery with aggravating circumstances to the charge sheet. Pillay’s lawyer Chris Gounden asked for an adjournment to consult with the accused on the new charge. The matter was postponed to the 11 October. Pillay will be kept in Westville prison until his next court appearance.
