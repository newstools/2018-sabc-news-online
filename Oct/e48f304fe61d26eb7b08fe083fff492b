The Nelson Mandela and Ahmed Kathrada foundations in South Africa are commemorating the life and times of the late Mozambican president, Samora Machel. This year marks the 32nd anniversary of the death of Machel, who died on October 19 1986, under mysterious circumstances when his plane crashed into the Lebombo Mountains in South Africa, after allegedly following a false beacon. Machelâ€™s widow, Graca, was the keynote speaker at the launch of a book on the life of Machel by Mozambican photo journalist, Kok Nam, on Thursday night. Click video below:
