Defence attorney Peter Daubermann, says the two  co-accused in the Timothy Omotoso rape trial have been excused from court on Monday as they fear for their lives. It follows incidents where the two women, Lusanda Sulani and Zukiswa Sitho, and their supporters were allegedly mobbed and drenched in water, outside the Port Elizabeth High Court last week. He added that the same happened to him and Omotoso’s wife Taiwo. He says there were too few police deployed at court. He also referred to false media reports and describes it as an attack on the judiciary.  Daubermann has expressed his concern that neither he nor the accused can come to court safely. It’s the judge’s duty to ensure a fair trial, he says. Daubermann was also criticised on Social Media for the manner in which he cross-examined 22-year-old Cheryl Zondi, with many saying he had been harsh and insensitive. “I was chased by an unruly mob when I left court on Wednesday, last week from the front of the building to where my car was parked, where water was thrown on me. This mob was chanting that I should drop the case. Solely in the interest of my clients receiving a fair trial, I am not doing this to defend myself but in the interest of justice and the legal system in this country. I support women’s rights in this country 100% and I am appalled with the way women have been treated previously in this country,” says Daubermann. Click link for more
