Human error is believed to be the cause of the fatal crashes on the country’s roads. This is according to Deputy Minister of Transport, Sindisiwe Chikunga, who was speaking at a mass funeral of 21 people who died in a multi-vehicle accident on the N1 near Mookgophong in Limpopo last week.  In total 26 people perished in that accident. Fifty-one people died on the N1 road in Limpopo in just six weeks. Preliminary reports suggest that negligence was the main cause of these fatalities. Fatigue, speed and overloading are some of the causes of the crashes. With the holiday season approaching, the number of South Africans who die in road accidents is significantly higher than the global average.  “The nature of the road contributes nothing to these fatal crashes. It is the behaviour of the driver. It is what people do or do not do that leads to the accidents. The accidents happen on public roads and you wonder what to do now,” says Chikunga. Limpopo’s premier Stan Mathabatha has warned against reckless driving. He’s appealed to motorists to be patient and cautious. The premier says traffic fatalities are still on the rise despite the drive to reduce the carnage. Watch video below:
