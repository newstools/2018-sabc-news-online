The North Gauteng High Court in Pretoria has sentenced a man to an effective 35 years in jail. He was found guilty of attempted murder of his then 11-year-old son as well as raping his 16-year-old daughter in 2014. He was also found guilty and sentenced for a plethora of charges including child abuse and neglect. Meanwhile, the mother of the children was handed a suspended five year sentence on the condition that she must undergo psychological therapy. The court found that she too was abused by the man. Friend of the father says: “I feel she could have got a sentence to feel the punishment in jail. Because he’s got the punishment, she doesn’t. She is walking out with her life, she can go to the fridge, get food, him not and she is the mother of these children, she should have stood up. The couple’s five children were rescued in 2014 after the then 11-year-old son ran to the neighbours. He had been brutally beaten by his father. The police had described their home as a house of horrors. The effective 35 years in jail sentence includes 10 years each for the attempted murder and rape charge. Judge Eben Jordaan says: “When asked about his children’s experiences, the accused blamed them of lying and being naughty.” The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) has welcomed the sentences. Phindi Mjonondwane, NPA Gauteng spokesperson says: “We believe it’s a sentence that sends a strong message to parents out there who neglect and abuse their kids. To remind them they are the primary care givers of these children and they have an obligation to take care of their children.” The children have since been placed in safe homes.  Both parents have not been allowed to see them.
