President Cyril Ramaphosa says the phenomenon of State Capture should never be repeated in South Africa. Ramaphosa referred to the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture after his announcement that Nhlanhla Nene has resigned as Finance Minister following his testimony at the commission. Tito Mboweni has since taken over the reigns. Ramaphosa has appealed to all South Africans to support the work of the commission to ensure wrongdoing is uncovered and those implicated are held to account. He says no person should be above scrutiny and no person should be above the law and all relevant and credible accusations of wrongdoing should be thoroughly investigated. He says: “It is incumbent upon any person who may have any knowledge of any of the matters within the commission’s mandate to provide that information, provide it to the commission and to do so honestly and to do so fully and completely as well. For a country to move forward we need to establish the full extent of state capture, identify those responsible for facilitating it and take decisive steps to prevent this from ever happening again in South Africa.”
