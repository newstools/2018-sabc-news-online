More than 100 social grant beneficiaries from the rural areas of Mbizana in the Eastern Cape have called for the intervention of the government to the termination of their social grants by South African Social Security Agency (Sassa). These beneficiaries include elderly people, people with disabilities and children, whose files were transferred from KwaZulu-Natal to the Eastern Cape, say they have been not receiving social grants since June. Sassa provincial spokesperson Luzuko Qhina says relocation by a large number of clients has prompted an investigation. Qhina said, “We have identified about 13000 beneficiaries that come from KZN and by law when you get such a huge number of people moving from one province to the other, you then begin to ask why are these people moving in such big numbers and the legislation thereof. This warrants that we do some investigations to establish as to the authenticity of those transfers.”
