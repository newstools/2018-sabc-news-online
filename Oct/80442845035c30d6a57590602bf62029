Westbury mother, Heather Peterson has been laid to rest in the township in Johannesburg. Peterson’s life was celebrated in a packed church this morning. Community members took to the streets, shutting the area down after Peterson was killed when she was caught in crossfire allegedly between rival gangs last week. One relative thanked the community for their support. “Through Heather, I could see that Heather loved people, she loved children and i just want to say thank you to God that he borrowed Heather for us on this earth. I just want to say thank you to each and everybody to show their love to Heather.” The husband of the late Heather Peterson, Ruben has thanked the community for the support they have offered the family. Peterson shares fond memories of his wife. “She was a person who always had a smile on her face. No nonsense mom. She loved her children dearly, as me she loved also. My children and I will always remember the mother of the house.” Peterson died last Thursday, after she was caught in a cross-fire between alleged rival gangs. Her ten-year-old relative was seriously wounded. The incident sparked outrage among communities members who took to the streets for several days.
