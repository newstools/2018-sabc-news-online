Leaders from so-called coloured communities in Gauteng have announced that there will not be total shutdown on Monday but they will picket throughout the week at various areas in Johannesburg. The leaders have met with a group calling itself the Gauteng Shutdown Co-ordinating Committee, at Eldorado Park in Johannesburg and have decided that a total shutdown will take place on Friday in honour of slain Westbury mother Heather Peterson. Last week residents from Westbury, Ennerdale and Eldorado Park embarked on a shutdown which turned into violent clashes with police. They accuse government of not doing anything about drugs and related crimes in their areas and excluding them from empowerment policies such as Black Economic Empowerment and Affirmative Action. “Tomorrow (Monday) there’s no official shutdown but tomorrow officially, we will start picketing. Tuesday we are taking our fight to the JSE. On Wednesday there is an executive meeting, there’s preparation but the big day for us is this coming Friday. Friday we will be meeting at Mary Fitzgerald Square in town and we are calling on everybody from all over Gauteng, every community to come out there in their numbers. We will be wearing brown t-shirts and the programme for Friday is called blood Friday, it is in honour of Heather Peterson. We are calling South Africans to go out there in every part of the province, wear a brown t-shirt, wear a black band on your left arm, “ says Gauteng Shutdown Coordinating Committee Anthony Williams.
