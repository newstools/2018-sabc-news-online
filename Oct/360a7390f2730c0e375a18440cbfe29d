Police have fired rubber bullets and teargas to disperse protesting crowds at Witsands in Atlantis on the West Coast. Protesters have locked down the area since Thursday morning by blockading roads with burning tyres and tree branches. “Angry residents pelted stones and empty bottles at the police. They also looted some of the local spaza shops.” Earlier they burnt tyres and marched through the streets in the area. They demand service delivery and the removal of seven councillors from office. Community Leader Luvuyo Matshisi says authorities refuse to build them a community hall despite securing private funding for this purpose. Several residents have been arrested for their alleged involvement in the protests.” Community members of the Witsands neighbourhood are demanding that at least seven members of the Cape Town metro council resign. They allege that these councillors are corrupt and delaying community development projects. The area saw similar protests two months ago with residents demanding that jobs be distributed equally. Spokesperson for the City of Cape’s Traffic department, Maxine Bezuidenhout, says police are on the scene. “The following road closures are in place in Atlantis due to protesting in that area. Old Mamre road is closed between Philadelphia and Starling roads as well as Klein Dassebgerg closed at the N-7. Motorists are asked to avoid that area and use alternative routes.”
