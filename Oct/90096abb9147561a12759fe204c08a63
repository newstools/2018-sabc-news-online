Cape Town Mayor, Patricia de Lille, has announced her resignation effective from 7 pm on Wednesday. She is also resigning as a Democratic Alliance(DA) member. She described her departure from the DA as her ” long walk to freedom”. There was uncertainty earlier today whether De Lille will vacate office as per agreement with the party. Two months ago, she announced her resignation during a media conference with DA leader, Mmusi Maimane. De Lille says she’s turned down various offers, including being a minister. Signing her resignation letter outside the Western Cape High Court, she’s also said she will make an announcement regarding her next career move in two weeks time. “This is my resignation letter than I am going to sign now. Dear Mr Speaker, I note that you have jumped the gun yesterday by announcing that you have received a resignation letter from me. That letter dated the 5th August was not addressed to you speaker, so that was a blatant lie yesterday. Please note that this is my official resignation from the City of Cape Town as the Exec Mayor effective from 19:00 on 31 Oct.” Watch video below:
