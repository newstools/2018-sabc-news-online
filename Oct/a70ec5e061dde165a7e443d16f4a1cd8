Democratic Alliance chief whip in the Cape Town council Shaun August has resigned in support of outgoing Mayor Patricia de Lille. De Lille has revealed that there’s another report by the Municipal Accounts Committee tabled before Council that has cleared her of any wrongdoing regarding the security upgrades at her private home. She has took a swipe at councillors who leaked law firm Bowman Gilfillan report implicating her in corruption. De Lille has dared them to also leak this report. She says there’s a group of party members bent on tarnishing what she terms her good name. De Lille was delivering what may be her last address to council as she is to resign at the end of the month. The Bowman Gilfillan forensic report, which recommended that she be disciplined, will be discussed by Council later Thursday afternoon and a decision taken on whether to accept or reject it.
