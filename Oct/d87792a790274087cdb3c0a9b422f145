The Freedom Front Plus (FF-Plus) will on Saturday launch its 2019 General Elections campaign at St George’s Park Cricket Stadium in Port Elizabeth. The party is set to unpack its five key focus areas for the elections next year. The FF-Plus believes it will gain more support this time around as it’s confident the five focus areas will appeal to voters. Freedom Front Plus MP Wouter Wessels says, “We decided that the Eastern Cape is in dire need of change and we have done research, not only our own but also through IPSOS research. A lot of people in the Eastern Cape are considering the Freedom Front Plus as an alternative. Our message is that we are here, we are ready to fight for a better South Africa and people should support us for change in the Eastern Cape.” Click below for FF Plus related videos…
