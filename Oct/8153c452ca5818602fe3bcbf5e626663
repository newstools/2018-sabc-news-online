Firefighting efforts are continuing in the area of Vermaaklikheid near Heidelberg in the Western Cape where several fires have broken out. An Air Force Orxy helicopter and three other aircraft have been roped in to assist in water bombing efforts. The fires started over the weekend amid hot and windy conditions. A Working on Fire pilot died after his helicopter crashed. The blaze has gutted at least seven homes. Garden Route District Municipality Mayor Memory Booysen said, “There are some more resources coming in, there are teams from Overberg. There are other teams that might come and assist us and we also have teams from Work on Fire (WOF) and we say thank you to everybody who have contributed some refreshments for the fire fighters.”
