The Louisvale community in Upington and surrounding farms is battling with the youth’s heavy usage of tik.  They say tik, which is a form of crystal meth, is regarded as a cheap drug that is easily accessible in various area. They have now decided to stand up and fight the scourge. A father of four used tik for sixteen years but has been clean for two years. He is now striving to become a father his children can look up to. “For 16 years I was involved with tik and in that period of time I was not the person who I am right now. For couple of days I was not eating, drinking, washing or sleeping – I was that kind of father who my kids didn’t love or trust; they didn’t have a father that time.” Young people in this community want drug dealers to be dealt with in order to save the youth in the area. Youth leader John Tieties says: “Our leaders in this community, they know who the people are selling drugs but they don’t confront these people. Our young kids from 7 to 13-years-old are caught in drug and alcohol abuse because there is no place for them to go and play.” Farmers have now stepped in to assist. Gert Cloete took in a family that was affected by tik. He is now working with some community members and has established a non-profit organisation that intends on finding ways to fight the scourge. Hands of Action Anti-drug Community Support Member Gert Cloete says: “I assisted the whole family just to get rid of a chain of addiction. I took them in my home when they were finally recovered I even built them a house so that they can get a normal family life.” The organisation is advising those affected by tik to talk to someone they can trust, if they have fears of coming forward to be assisted.
