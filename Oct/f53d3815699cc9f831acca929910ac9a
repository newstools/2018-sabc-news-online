President Cyril Ramaphosa has called on people who are beneficiaries of government RDP houses to refrain from selling their houses. The President was speaking during the handing over of title deeds to Franklin Township residents outside Kokstad in Southern KwaZulu-Natal on Wednesday. The four hundred beneficiaries were working and living in farm compounds for many years with no hope that one day they will own their own homes. “What we are asking you is that,  if you get your title deed don’t take it and sell the house you have been given by government, because there are some who sell their houses and in most cases sell these houses at far low prices, much lower than what  the amount government spent in building the house,” says Ramaphosa.
