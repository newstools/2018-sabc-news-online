There’s no sign of protesters yet in Ennerdale and Eldorado Park south of Johannesburg as expected Friday morning. A group calling themselves The Gauteng Shutdown Co-ordinating Committee has planned a protest in the so-called coloured communities. Organisers of the campaign say about 10 coloured communities across Gauteng will embark on total shutdowns on Friday. The shutdowns are aimed at highlighting what the communities have described as social exclusion. The communities say they are marginalized by their own government. The group has vowed to bring to a standstill services within the their communities to get the president’s attention. The busy Golden Highway passing through Ennerdale and Eldorado Park which is always a target of protests is clear and open to traffic.
