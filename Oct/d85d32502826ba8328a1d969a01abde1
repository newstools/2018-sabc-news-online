Outgoing Cape Town Mayor, Patricia de Lille, has given four Democratic Alliance (DA) members seven days in which to respond to her letter or face legal action. De Lille has written an open letter to them demanding an apology after they reposted an article of a fake report by the Auditor-General. The fake report alleged that De Lille was involved in several irregularities which related to MyCiti bus tenders. De Lille explains: “I have instructed my attorneys to commence with legal action against them in respect of the defamatory allegations but before doing so, I would like to afford them an opportunity to retract the statement or the posting they made and so apologise to me in public. For that I have given them seven days.” De Lille has remained tight-lipped about whether or not she intends to resign as a member of the DA when she leaves office at the end of the month. De Lille resigned as mayor in August following protracted differences with the party. WATCH RELATED VIDEO:
