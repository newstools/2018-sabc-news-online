The Democratic Alliance (DA) has reacted to rumours that outgoing Cape Town Mayor Patricia de Lille may not resign as expected at the end of the month. The party reached the agreement with De Lille two months ago following prolonged tensions. On Thursday, five councillors resigned in solidarity with De Lille, citing alleged racism within the DA among their reasons. Two reports implicating De Lille in alleged corruption were also adopted by the city council. Deputy Chairperson of the DA Federal Council Thomas Walters explains what could happen if De Lille decides to revoke her decision to resign. “I think one of the reasons that on the 31st of October that she agreed to resign is to create the space for an un-adulterated independent investigation. But, if she doesn’t stick to the agreement, then such an agreement ceases to exist and that means the party has the right to institute whatever processes it feels fit according to our constitution.” Watch the video below for related news:
