Dam levels in Cape TownÂ have dropped by about 1% in the last week due to a heat wave. Dam levels are currently at just under 75% of storage capacity. The city of Cape Town says the 0.9% drop is largely due to evaporation caused by the hot, dry weather. The average daily water consumption has also increased by 37 million litres to 593 million litres per day for the past week. The city is calling on residents to continue to save water by avoiding using hose pipes to water gardens, topping up swimming pools and using drinking water to wash vehicles.
