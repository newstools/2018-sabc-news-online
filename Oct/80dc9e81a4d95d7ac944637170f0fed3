The Sefako Makgatho Health Sciences University in Ga-Rankuwa, in Tshwane, has hosted a memorial service in honour of the institution’s first Chancellor, Doctor Edna Molewa. The Environmental Affairs Minister passed away on the 22 September, after a short illness. She was inaugurated as Chancellor of the University in March last year. Vice-Chancellor of the Sefako Makgatho Health Sciences University, Professor Chris de Beer says Edna Molewa contributed significantly towards stabilising and developing the institution. He said she introduced the fledgling university to national and international networks and helped restore institutional self-confidence. “Ladies and gentlemen, SMU has lost a mother, a friend, a mentor, a passionate supporter and institutional leader. But ladies and gentleman we have also lost our beautiful princess.” Gauteng Health MEC, Dr Gwen Ramakgopa, has asked all South Africans to celebrate Molewa’s legacy, by working together for a better and stronger economy.  She says Molewa had unlimited energy when working selflessly for the nation. Ramakgopa says Molewa was fuelled by her passion for equality, justice and a desire to leave this world a better place for future generations. “We must remember her by working across political parties. If we have to contest, let us contest, but once the contestation is over let us work together as true patriots,  as Edna Molewa was, as true South Africans, not only for ourselves but for the future generations. And we must also work across all sectors of society.” Molewa will be laid to rest in Pretoria on Saturday. Click below for more on Molewa:
