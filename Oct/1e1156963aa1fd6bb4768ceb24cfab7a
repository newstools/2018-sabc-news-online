Transport month kicked off on a good note for two young KwaZulu-Natal entrepreneurs. This after they launched their third oil tanker at Durban’s port. The two are the first black owners of tankers in the country’s history. 33-year-old friends Durand Naidoo and Thuso Mhlambi are making history in the Maritime Industry previously reserved for whites. The duo purchased a shipping company last year. Mlambi says to date they own three oil tankers and have employed over 100 workers. The two met at a Durban primary school in 1996 and became friends, their dream was always to own a shipping business. Naidoo says worked for a shipping company while Mhlambi became an accountant. “It feels amazing. I think a lot of people would believe that it’s a sense of accomplishment but for us it’s really a start. The maritime industry still has a long way to transform and I believe it’s an industry, that can open up a lot of doors especially for employment.” WATCH BELOW:
