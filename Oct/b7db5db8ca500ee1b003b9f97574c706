Basic Education Minister, Angie Motshekga, has described the death of Eastern Cape Education MEC, Mandla Makupula, as a great loss to the education system. Motshekga has visited Makupula’s family in East London to convey her condolences. Makupula died on Monday morning in East London after a long illness. He will be laid to rest on the 20th of October. Motshega says Makupula was an intelligent and a humble leader. “We are at a stage where we could feel that now there is traction; they have turned the corner. And really, the province was at a very steady hand in a very troubled and difficult province. And with his humility it was very easy to engage  comrade Mandla to say, ‘Comrade, I’ve been to this place and these are the problems.’ And he would never  feel overwhelmed or (that) people are managing him. He was very humble and would say, ‘No sis Angie. I will attend to it.’” says Motshekga.
