The Democratic Alliance KwaZulu-Natal premier candidate for the 2019 elections Zwakele Mncwango says every leader needs to commit to curbing the high rate of unemployment in South Africa. Mncwango is embarking on a listening tour across the province to get various communities’ views ahead of the elections. Mncwango started at his birth place in KwaNongoma in the northern part of the province. He says it is important to focus on growing the economies of rural communities. “We have an idea that South Africans in KwaZulu-Natal want a government that will stop corruption, stop crime and ensure that our economy is growing but all these things talk to the issue of the high level of unemployment in the province. While I am excited that people came in numbers, when you see young people coming here it tells you that there is a challenge of unemployment. It is real because they are not here because they have taken leave from work, but they are unemployed and it is something that we should not take lightly as political leaders. We must make commitments to ensure that we actually grow our economies; especially in our rural areas.” Mncwango adds that the DA wants to develop an election manifesto based on the views of the people. “I understand the challenges that are facing this community and I believe I am equal to the task and I have to work very hard on this campaign. Part of this visit was actually to launch our listening tour because before when you develop the manifesto, it is important that it must be based on the will of the people.”
