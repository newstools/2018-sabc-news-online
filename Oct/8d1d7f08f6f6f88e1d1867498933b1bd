The Cape Town Weather Office says the heatwave the Western Cape is currently experiencing a heatwave expected to persist until Sunday. Temperatures ranging from the high thirties to the low forties have been forecast across the province for Saturday and Sunday. Senior Weather Forecaster, Kate Turner, says a cold front will be hitting the province on Monday, bringing with it cooler conditions and rain. “Monday with that 10 degree drop would bring us down to around about the 30 degree mark and dropping down into the lower to mid-twenties for Tuesday. That’s also due to the next frontal system that’s approaching.” “We are expecting that frontal system to be moving in, bringing rain for the Cape Town area already for Monday evening overnight and spreading to most of the Western Cape during the course of Tuesday,” adds Turner.
