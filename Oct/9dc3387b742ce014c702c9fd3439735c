The Economic Freedom Fighter (EFF) in the North West is calling on Premier Job Mokgoro, to fire the MEC for Social Development, Hoffman Galeng. The EFF cites allegations that, Galeng has hired four private security guards to protect his private residence in Vryburg, using taxpayers’ money. It’s alleged that he is using R50 000 a month to pay the guards. This is despite spending most of his time in his official residence in Mahikeng. EFF spokesperson, Jerry Matebesi, says they regard this as the misuse of public funds. “We are saying to the Premier Prof Job Mokgoro please remove this MEC because we have never seen a report of law enforcement agencies which indicate that his life was in endanger. He has got an official residence where there are full time security personnel, but we don’t understand the rationale behind him having securities, at his own private resident,” says Matebesi. Meanwhile, Chairperson of the province’s Standing Committee on Public Accounts (SCOPA), Mahlakeng Mahlakeng, says his committee will summon Galeng and his top management this week to account for the matter. “As far as we concerned MECs are entitled to about 100 thousand for matters of security, which is really R100 000 per term. We are not aware of anything beyond that, so we would like to understand. Should we find that to be the true and that kind of money has been used, we are going to be forced to request him to pay back the money that was not properly or used in relation to matters of security,”says Mahlakeng.
