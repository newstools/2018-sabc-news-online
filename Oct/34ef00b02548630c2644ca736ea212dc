The African National Congress (ANC) in KwaZulu-Natal has urged all eligible voters to register to cast their ballot in the 2019 general elections. In preparation for 2019, the party has officially launched a voter registration drive. Provincial ANC Spokesperson Nomagugu Simelane says the drive will focus on creating awareness among young people to exercising their right to vote. “The intention is to go throughout the province, encourage young people to get ID’s, but once they have done that, we encourage them to go and register to vote. In the past, we have learnt that young people often are not aware that once they receive their ID, they must register to vote for them to be able to vote. It’s assumed that as soon as you are of a voting age you can be able to vote. So, it’s part of our campaign and drive to go around talking to young people and ensuring that they excised their right to vote and it to get ID and registered,” says Simelane.
