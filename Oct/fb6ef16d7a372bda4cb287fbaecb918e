Temperatures plummeted in KwaZulu-Natal overnight after snow fell on the highest peaks of the Drakensberg. The province also received good rainfall which was fairly widespread. The heaviest snow fell at Sani Pass in the southern Berg near the Lesotho border. As the sun rose on Thursday morning, the snow-covered peaks provided for some spectacular views. Some of the highest peaks in other parts of the Drakensberg were also covered with a white dusting of snow. “We did have some snow up until earlier this morning (Thursday), the snow is currently visible on the satellite imagery over the southern Drakensberg which were the areas were most concerned about in terms of disruptive snowfall covering areas like royal natal proceeding south towards Underberg and Kokstad,” says SA Weather Service, Sthandile Gumede. However, even though spring has sprung, snow is not that unusual at this time of the year.  “The weather system is normal for this time of the year, what results to this varies from case to case like how we saw snow last year in October,” says Gumede. The weather is expected to warm up over the next few days.  It is likely that all snow would have melted by the end of the weekend. Thembela Ciliwe
