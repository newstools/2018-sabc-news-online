Hundreds of Tshwane University of Technology (TUT) students have been allowed inside the Soshanguve Magistrate’s Court where two police officers are applying for bail after being arrested for the murder of student Katlego Monareng. Some students are protesting outside the court. The two police officers were nabbed by IPID on Monday in connection with the alleged crime during the aborted TUT SRC elections. It’s alleged the police fired live ammunition at the students as warning shots. TUT student leader, Thabang Boima says students want justice to be served. He says: “We are going to ensure that justice is served for comrade Katlego Monareng by protesting outside court. We trust the justice system. The only message we are sending is we do not want this incident to occur in future. Whether they get bail or not, indeed at last we got justice as the people responsible for the death have been arrested.”
