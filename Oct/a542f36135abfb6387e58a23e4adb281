The South African Communist Party (SACP) says it supports the State Enterprise Minister Pravin Gordhan in the fight against corruption in government. This after minister Gordan wrote an article in one of the Sunday newspapers that one of the Gupta companies allegedly received illicit payments worth more than R7.7 billion. The party’s first deputy general secretary, Solly Mapaila says the SACP is rallying behind Gordan in uprooting corruption. Mapaila was addressing SACP delegates at the Mpumalanga SACP provincial RED October campaign in Tekwane North outside Mbombela. “We want to express our full support for his interventions to make sure that we fight against state capture and corruption in state enterprises, he must count on our support. He must continue the fight. The Communist party is there to back him up until we succeed and recover even our monies. We can’t redeem ourselves as a movement until we take action, serious actions, against those implicated in state capture and corruption, therefore we call for the looters to be arrested.”
