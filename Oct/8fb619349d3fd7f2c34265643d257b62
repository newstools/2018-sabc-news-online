The Nelson Mandela Bay ANC Regional Executive Committee says it’s awaiting a formal communication from the Secretary General, Ace Magashule, before it implements the decision of Andile Lungisa relinquishing his position, as the Member of the Mayoral Committee for Infrastructure. The NEC instructed Lungisa to resign as he has a pending case. Lungisa is out on bail pending a petition to the High Court for leave to appeal his effective two-year jail term for assaulting DA councillor, Rano Kayser, during the infamous council meeting brawl of 2016. The ANC took a resolution during its 53rd National Conference in Mangaung in 2012 that members facing allegations of improper misconduct, must not hold public office. Regional Secretary Themba Xathula  says they have not received a formal letter from the Secretary General Ace Magashula. “We are still processing that decision as the people who were tasked to execute the task. Hence I’m saying we will be talking through the provincial secretary to say they must give us a resolution or a letter to that effect. We can’t verbally instruct someone to be out of the deployment given by the organization. So we will exhaust internally with the intention of meeting.” WATCH RELATED VIDEO:
