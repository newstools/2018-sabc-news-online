Mineral Resources Minister, Gwede Mantashe, says there’s room for greater investment by the private sector. This comes after mining company, Anglo American, announced its investment of R70 billion into the mining industry at the Investment Summit in Sandton. Mantashe says government is also attending to the call for intervention in the prices of electricity costs. “That is on the table. When you hear the President in the stimulus package talking about administered prices, that includes railway costs, electricity costs and water costs. So that issue is under discussion,” adds the Mineral Resources Minister.
