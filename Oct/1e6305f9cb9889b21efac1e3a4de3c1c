SARS inquiry CommissionÂ Chair, retired Judge Robert Nugent has recommended that President Cyril Ramaphosa should fire suspended SARS Commissioner Tom Moyane with immediate effect, in order to set the organisation on a firm path of recovery. The Presidency has confirmed that the interim report has been submitted to the President by the Commission. President Ramaphosa appointed Judge Nugent to chair the commission of inquiry into tax administration and governance at SARS in May. In the report, Nugent says that he is aware that Moyane is facing a disciplinary process, however he considers this to be irrelevant to his recommendations. The Commission further recommends that a new Commissioner be appointed as the first step of setting the organisation in good stead. In a statement, the President said that he is applying his mind to the contents of the report. Read the full Interim Report:  Click video below:
