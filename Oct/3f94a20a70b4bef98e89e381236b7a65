Officials from the city of Johannesburg have embarked on a clean up operation of the Rea Vaya bus station which was completely destroyed by protesting residents of Westbury earlier this week. Protests erupted on Thursday last week after a woman was shot dead and her niece wounded in a cross fire of gang-related violence. More than 15 employees from the city of Johannesburg are cleaning up debris glass from the destroyed Westbury Rea Vaya bus station. Residents smashed all the windows and doors with rocks and boulders during the protest. Meanwhile, community members together with their leaders are preparing to meet police minister, Bheki Cele for the second time this week. Community members had threatened another shutdown after the ministerâ€™s promise of an increased police presence in the area did not happen.
