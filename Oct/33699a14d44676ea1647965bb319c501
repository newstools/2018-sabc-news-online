Home Affairs Minister, Malusi Gigaba has accused State Security officials of being behind the release of the explicit sexual video that has been circulating on social media. Gigaba claims the video is at the centre of blackmail and extortion attempts against him, and was obtained when his phone was hacked when he was still Minister of Finance. His spokesperson Vuyo Mkhize says Gigaba has credible evidence and he was blackmailed for money as well as interfering in transactions at State-Owned Entities in favour of his blackmailers. Mkhize says Gigaba approached several government officials over the matter including the State Security Minister at the time, David Mahlobo. “The minister knows for a fact that his communication was hacked by state security agents.  He received tangible evidence to this effect. Several started demanding from around April an amount if R10 million in cash. When it became clear that he was really not interested in entertaining these blackmail demands the call now began to demand that he intervenes in various state entities and ensure that whoever was behind the calls or the demands received business opportunities that would earn them a net profit of R20 million upwards. At that point he approached the State Intelligence minister, the DG of State Security; he then submitted this to the inspector general.” Watch for more:   <span style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" data-mce-type="bookmark" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span>
