The bodies of two children have been found in a veld behind the Slovoville cemetery in Soweto south of Johannesburg. Police have revealed that the bodies of the boy and girl were discovered by a passer-by on Monday. The decomposed bodies of the girl, and a boy believed to be around 10 and 11 years old were found buried in a single shallow grave. They had been blindfolded with their hands tied. It’s unclear when the children were killed. Authorities say no cases of missing children have been reported at any of the police stations within the area. They believe it’s possible that that boy and girl could be from elsewhere in the province. They are appealing to parents and the public to come forward with any information that may help identify the victims as well as the perpetrators of this horrific crime.
