About 10 000 members ofÂ  the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (NUMSA) in the plastic industry will embark on a strike on Monday. The union says the strike will paralyse all sectors across the economy especially those in the automobile and telecommunications industries. Union representatives say their members in plastic-related industries are working under appalling conditions and wages remain dismal. NUMSA members are expected to down tools on Monday in the plastic industry. The strike is expected to affect 450 companies in the plastic manufacturing, plastic moulding and plastic packaging industries. The automobile and mobile industry will be the hardest hit. NUMSA is calling for a 15 % increase for its members across the board backdated from 2014. The union is also demanding that its members receive the same benefits as workers in the engineering sector.
