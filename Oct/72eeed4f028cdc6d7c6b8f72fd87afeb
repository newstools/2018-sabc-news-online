Another Cape Town fire has gutted 120 homes in the Kosovo informal settlement in Philippi. Disaster Risk Management Spokesperson, Mandy Thomas, says the fire swept through the area overnight, leaving more than 1 400 people displaced. The fire comes less than 24 hours after the one that left more than 1 000 people displaced in Khayelitsha on the Cape Flats. Thomas says no injuries have been reported. “A fire occurred last night in the Kosovo informal settlement in Philippi. Approximately 120 dwellings were destroyed and approximately 1 400 people have been affected. City officials are still on site, assessing the damage.” Meanwhile, Civic organization, Sanco in the Western Cape has called on government to speed up housing delivery in the province. The Sanco leadership visited the SST informal settlement
in Khayelitsha on the Cape Flats on Sunday afternoon. This after a fire destroyed more than 300 structures in the area Saturday morning. The City of Cape Town has cleared the rubble from the area and delivered building material to the fire victims. Most of the victims will spend a second night at community and church halls. Sanco Provincial Secretary Bongikhaya Qhama says providing proper housing is the only way to avoid shack fires. “Our people continue to suffer and live in squalor conditions such as this and we believe that it has to come to an end. We believe the people of Khayelitsha SST should get the same treatment as those living in affluent areas.” Watch video below:
