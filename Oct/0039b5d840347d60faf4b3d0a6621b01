The trial of Timothy Omotoso and two co-accused Lusanda Solani and Zukiswa Sitho remains tense. This as the first witness has taken the stand at the Port Elizabeth High Court. The 22 year-old woman has shed a tear as she told the court about how confused she was when Omotoso kept on asking her if she had a love life during brief calls when she was 14 years-old. This is the first of 49 witnesses expected to take the stand during the trial. Omotoso faces charges ranging from trafficking for sexual purposes and racketeering to rape and sexual assault.
