The community of Vlakfontein, south of Johannesburg, is reeling from shock following the murder of seven members of a family. The three women and four children aged between two and 11 years old were found buried under heaps of sand inside and outside their house. A man believed to have been staying with the deceased has been taken in for questioning. Police are searching for a second man known as Sibusiso Khoza who they believe could help them with their investigations. Forensic experts have concluded their investigations and some of the residents donning face masks are busy cleaning up the house.  Residents are struggling to come to terms with what has befallen the family. “We found other corpses maybe he killed the people and rolled them with the blanket and we found lot of soil.  I think he was trying to bury them in the room.  There were four kids found dead here.  In this room there was a lot of blood.  We are shocked as women we have kids there are small kids that are dead here,” says one of the residents.    A family friend of the seven murdered members of a family in Vlakfontein says it appears the deceased had been buried inside the house for over a week as their bodies had begun to decompose. Mandisa Moruge is still trying to process what she saw. “There was a lot of soil. The suspect threw lot of soil on the bodies to try and conceal the deed. So we had to remove the soil and the blankets full of blood and bodily fluids that were stinking badly. Even now we are trying to clean the house. We’re using anything that can to help us to disinfect the house. Yeah!!! It’s bad it’s quiet bad.”
