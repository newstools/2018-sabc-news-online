It is not yet clear whether Cape Town Mayor Patricia De Lille will vacate office on Wednesday as per agreement with her party the Democratic Alliance (DA). Two months ago, De Lille announced her resignation during a media conference with DA leader Mmusi Maimane, when they told the media that the DA would drop internal charges against her and that she would resign as mayor on the 31st of October 2018. Tuesday night, De Lille took to Twitter, describing the DA as the ‘dramatic alliance’. She has also denies reports that she has sent a resignation letter to the Speaker of the City of Cape Town Dirk Smit, saying Smit is lying when he says she has resigned. DA deputy chairperson of the Federal Council Natasha Mazzone says the party’s lawyers have written to De Lille to state that the DA expects her to vacate her office on Wednesday as per the agreement. De Lille is expected to make her plans for the future known later on Wednesday. DA leader Mmusi Maimane says De Lille must explain the retraction of her resignation to the South African public. Speaking to the media Tuesday night, Maimane said they cannot allow De Lille to side-track them from allegations of wrongdoing against her.
