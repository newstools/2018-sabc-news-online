The Gauteng Education Department says it will soon meet management of Jeppe Girls’ High and the school governing body over the Hijab or headscarves fiasco. This comes after Seven Muslim learners were allegedly been banned by the school from wearing Hijabs as the school believes they contravened its code of conduct. The department’s Steven Mabona says they have engaged the school and urged them to stop discriminating against the learners on the basis of religion. Mabona said the school’s code of conduct should be amended as it contravenes the Constitution. “What must happen is our meeting between the School Governing Body (SGB) and the school management to say how we facilitate a process of amending this code of conduct. So in principle we agree that this code of conduct must be amended, said Mabona.
