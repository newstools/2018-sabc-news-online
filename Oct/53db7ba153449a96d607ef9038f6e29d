Trade union, Numsa has reassured members who work in the plastic sector that a national strike scheduled to begin on Monday will be protected. The union has accused employers of trying to intimidate workers out of participating in the strike by labelling it as illegal. It is alleged that workers have been threatened with disciplinary action and dismissal. Numsa wants the R20 an hour wages doubled to R40 and also wants bonuses reinstated. At least 10 000 Numsa workers are expected to down tools. Numsa National Spokesperson, Phakamile Hlubi-Majola says all processes have been followed. The strike will commence legally as planned. Hlubi-Majola says: “Talks which began in 2016 broke down. We lodged a dispute with the negotiating forum in March and we served them a notice in terms of Section 64 of the Labour Relations Act. A 30-day period has to have lapsed between the parties for us to be able to legally embark on a strike, and this is the case. We reject this desperate attempt to stop our members from exercising their right. We call on all our members to prepare themselves for a total national plastics shutdown.”
