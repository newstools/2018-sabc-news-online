Westbury residents, west of Johannesburg have again started barricading roads with rocks and burning tyres as they regroup to resume protest action ahead of Police Minister Bheki Cele’s visit to their area on Tuesday. The police have been engaged in running battles with angry protesters from last week Friday. On Monday evening, a Rea Vaya bus station was partly damaged after protesting residents attacked it with stones and a petrol bomb. The residents have been protesting against drugs and other forms of crimes in the area. The protest was sparked by an alleged gang-related shooting in which a woman was killed and a child was critically injured. Tyres have started burning again in Westbury on Tuesday morning as angry community members resume to block roads, prompting motorists in the vicinity to turn away. While they’ve welcomed the news of Cele visiting the area, they say they want to send a strong message that they will not stop until the concerns are addressed. The residents hope that Cele will bring tangible solutions, and not just address them and leave. They say they’ve lost faith in some police officers and their leaders at the Sophiatown police station and are demanding sweeping changes. The police are watching the situation closely.
