The Democratic Alliance (DA) has decried what it deems South Africa’s poor boarder control systems, saying government is unable to control the movement of undocumented foreigners. The party’s Gauteng Premier Candidate Solly Msimanga unveiled the DA’s Immigration Plan. The opposition has lashed out at the governing party, criticising security at the country’s borders. Msimanga says the influx of undocumented foreigners hampers the need for proper service delivery. “It becomes a bit problematic to plan from a government perspective, in terms of the people that are flowing into your province. For one, you cannot even know at any given time how many people are coming into your province. “If you don’t know how many people you are supposed to be catering for, how are you going to ensure that you have enough beds in your hospitals? How are you going to make sure that you have enough schools? As things stand right now and if you look at the report that is coming from the Gauteng Legislature and with the NCOP (National Council of Provinces), it says that Gauteng now is in need of 130 plus schools.” – Mbali Thethani
