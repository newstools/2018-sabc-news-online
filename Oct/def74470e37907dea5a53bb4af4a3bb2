The City of Cape Town’s Gang and Drug Task Team has conducted anti-crime operations in Manenberg and Hanover Park on the Cape Flats, in an attempt to curb drug dealing and clamp down on illegal firearms. Mayoral Committee Member for Safety and Security, JP Smith says, “Metro police took a firearm here in Hanover Park that was as a result of the shot spotter system.  About 70% of the firearms were taken come from that system that runs in Hanover Park and Manenberg. We’re negotiating to expand it, because we want to see it present in at least 5 or 6 more of our gang hotspots.” “For the rest of its random stop and search, searching people who fit the profile,” added Smith. The operation is in response to tip-offs from ward councillors and community members.
