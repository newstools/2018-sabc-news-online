A healthcare worker abducted by Islamic State in Nigeria in March may be killed within 24 hours, the International Committee of the Red Cross said in a statement on Sunday, pleading for mercy and urging Nigeria’s government to work for her release. “Speed and urgency are critical. A deadline that could result in the killing of another healthcare worker is less than 24 hours away,” ICRC says, adding that one of two other women, Saifura Hussaini Ahmed Khors, abducted at the same time was killed in September.
