Three people have been killed and at least 15 others injured in a collision between two trucks at Cosmo City, along Malibongwe Drive, north of Johannesburg. Netcare 911 says three people sustained fatal injuries, three sustained critical injuries and multiple others sustained moderate injuries. ER24 spokesperson Russel Meiring says emergency services are still on scene. He says the major road, also called the R512 has been closed to traffic while the cause of the collision is investigated by authorities. Meiring says: “Upon assessment paramedics discovered that four people had sustained numerous fatal injuries. Nothing could be done for them and they were declared dead on the scene.” “Approximately, 15 other patients were assessed, four were found to be in a critical condition. Paramedics provided the critically injured with advanced life support interventions. Two of the critically injured patients were airlifted to hospital.”
