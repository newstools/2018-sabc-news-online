The Free State Health Department has refuted claims of mystery surrounding the ‘disappearance’ of a newborn baby boy from Pelonomi Hospital. The baby’s mother says the last time she saw him was when the doctor took him for a bath. Later when she asked to see the baby and the doctor related the news that the baby had died. The mother, Ntebaleng Finger (18), is adamant that her baby is still alive. She says the doctor refused to show her the baby’s body. Department spokesperson Mondli Mvambi says the hospital has confirmed that the baby died. “Immediately when we heard about the incident we called the office of the CEO so that they can give us a report on what could have happened, and they reported to us that the baby has died. It’s unfortunate that because of respect of our patient confidentiality we are not able to go into detail as to what could have happened. So – if there is a case that has been opened, we welcome that, because then the truth will come out… she was given counselling, she was shown her baby, because it is her right to see the baby.”
