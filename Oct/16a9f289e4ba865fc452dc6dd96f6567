Labour union Nehawu is to meet striking social security agency (Sassa) workers on Thursday to decide the way forward following the suspension of the Biometric Enrolment for grant beneficiaries. This follows a meeting between Social Development Minister Susan Shabangu, representatives of Nehawu and senior Sassa officials in Johannesburg on Wednesday. Sassa workers have been on strike countrywide since Wednesday calling for the suspension of the biometric system. They say the system’s challenges makes it vulnerable to fraud, adding that using it is not part of their job description. Nehawu General Secretary Zola Saphetha says, “Workers are going to report to picket lines. Once we finalise talking to all members then a determination will be made as to what happens with the strike.”
