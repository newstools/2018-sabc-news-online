The official memorial service for 61-year-old Environmental Affairs Minister Edna Molewa will be held at the Tshwane Events Centre in Pretoria on Wednesday. Democratic Alliance (DA) leader in Limpopo, Jacque Smalle, says the late Environmental Affairs Minister, Edna Molewa, played an important role in conservation and that her death leaves a huge gap in the political and environmental landscape. Smalle says future generations will remember Molewa for her conservation efforts that possibly saved the rhino from extinction in South Africa. “My hope is that Molewa will be recognised and be awarded for her efforts, and be considered for a Nobel peace award, just as the Nobel peace laureate Mangari Mathai the Kenyan environmental political activist was awarded too,” adds Smalle.
