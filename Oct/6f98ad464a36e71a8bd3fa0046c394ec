The ninth annual Funda Mzantsi Championship is being held at George in the Southern Cape this week. It is a reading competition for book clubs from correctional facilities and schools from across the country. This year about 240 offenders and 200 learners are participating. Western Cape Correctional Services Commissioner, Delekile Klaas says they want to inculcate a culture of reading among the youth and also as a way to rehabilitate offenders. “Nine years ago we took the initiative to establish this championship, so today we’ll be having book club competitions of offenders from across the country, from various schools across the country, for the first time we’ll also be having braille book clubs where the blind would also be competing,” says Klaas.
