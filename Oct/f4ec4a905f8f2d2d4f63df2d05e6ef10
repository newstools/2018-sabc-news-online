A case of public violence has been opened after the community of Reiger Park, on Gauteng’s East Rand allegedly attacked police with petrol bombs Friday night. Police say things got out of hand when a promise to reinstate electricity connections by 7 o’clock Friday night was not met. Community members had embarked on protest action earlier this week,because of power outages in recent weeks. They barricaded roads and obstructed traffic in the process. SAPS Spokesperson, Kay Makhubele says no arrests have been made. He says other areas that saw protest action earlier this week, such as Riverlea and Westbury are currently quiet but police will continue to monitor them.
