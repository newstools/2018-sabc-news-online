The National Prosecution Authority (NPA) believes it still has a strong case against Nigerian Pastor Timothy Omotoso despite delays. The case is being heard in the High Court in Port Elizabeth, Eastern Cape. Omotoso and two-co accused Zukiswa Sitho and Lusanda Sulani are facing about 97 sexual-related offences. The case was delayed as the defence wanted the presiding judge Mandela Makaula to recuse himself from the case after accusing him of being biased towards the state’s first witness 22-year-old Cheryl Zondi. Last week Makaula dismissed this application, and again on Tuesday, he dismissed the defence’s application for leave to appeal the decision. NPA provincial spokesperson, Tshepo Ndwalaza says they will now proceed with the case. “ The judge has said it clearly that he dismisses the appeal and we believe that he has taken a  just and proper decision, but of course the defence is going to go to the SCA to petition so that the judge can be recused and charges quashed. But we still believe that he has taken the right decision and that we have a strong case and we will be going ahead with it.” Click below for more on the story:
