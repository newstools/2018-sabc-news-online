The two Soshanguve police officers accused of the murder of Tshwane University of Technology  (TUT) student Katlego Monareng have each been granted bail of R2000 in the local Magistrate’s Court in the Tshwane Metro. Captain Joseph Rapoo and Constable John Slender were arrested by police watchdog Independent Police Investigative Directorate (IPID) on Monday. Monareng was killed in August when police allegedly opened fire on a crowd of students blocking an exit from the TUT North campus in Soshanguve. Magistrate Johanna Luus said on Tuesday that if she were to refuse the accused bail, it would amount to punishment before the start of the trial. “Punishment is handed down when a person is convicted of a crime. Therefore the court’s submission is that on all the evidence before the court the court cannot find any reason why bail should be denied. Therefore bail is granted for both of the accused in an amount of R2000. The matter is postponed to 25 January 2019.”
