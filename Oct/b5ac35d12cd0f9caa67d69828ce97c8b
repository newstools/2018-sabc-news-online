The world celebrates World Teachers’ Day  on 5 October. 2018 marks the 70th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights that recognises education as a key fundamental right and establishes an entitlement to free compulsory education, ensuring inclusive and equitable access for all children. The theme for this year’s celebration is, “The right to education means the right to a qualified teacher.” Did you have a favorite teacher at school?
