The South Africa Social Security Agency (Sassa), says it has reached an agreement with trade union National Education, Health and Allied Workers’ Union (Nehawu) to suspend the nationwide strike with the aim of finding solutions to the workers’ grievances. Sassa employees went on strike yesterday to demand to be consulted on the new biometric system. Acting CEO Abraham Mahlangu says a joint task team including representatives of both the employer and the union has been established to address the workers’ concerns. “Yes we have agreed on the suspension of the strike-we do know that the organised labour and employees were indicating that the consultation was not adequate and secondly they say training was not adequate. We have put a case that says consultation did happen. They say….it was not adequate and we will improve on that. We have set a task team jointly between us and the organised labour to deal with the issues of technical nature and the issues of operational nature that may have affected the employees.”
