ANC Whip in Parliament’s Portfolio Committee on Communications, Lerumo Kalako, has slammed the DA for calling on SABC executives to make their salaries public. Kalako says the executive directors cannot be forced make their remuneration public. The DA’s Phumzile van Damme recently questioned whether SABC COO, Chris Maroleng, was receiving the same R2, 7 million “inflated salary” that his predecessor Hlaudi Motsoeneng was earning as reflected in the 2017/2018 financial year. She also wanted the salary packages of the CEO and CFO to be made public. Kalako says the DA’s call is premature. “What the DA is looking for,  will come in the Auditor General’s report of the coming financial year and also in their coming APP(Annual Performance Plan). But when they appear to us we will want that information. We can’t force them to publish it because really why would you force them when we can call them to actually give us a report on that? And Parliament is public,” says Kalako.
