Three suspected drug dealers have been arrested during a crime prevention operation in Eldorado Park, south of Johannesburg. The police’s Mathapelo Peters says the drugs Cat and Crystal Meth of a yet unknown street value were confiscated during the raids. “The two male suspects aged 33 and 42 have been linked to 4 previous cases of drug dealing and also feature on the police’s list of wanted suspects. The third suspect is a 41 year old female. “Members of the public are encouraged to continue to report crime to police and police management in Gauteng has welcomed the arrest of the trio as police continue to collaborate with communities in cleaning up the streets of Gauteng from drugs and other crimes,” says Peters.
