The National Council Against Smoking says it wants tax on cigarettes increased by 70% to reduce tobacco consumption and increase tax revenue. The Council says it will propose to Treasury an increase in the prices of cigarettes to between R5 and R7 a box. The council says there are 44 000 South Africanâ€™s that die as a result of tobacco related diseases each year. This number has not fallen over the past 10 years. The tobacco industry is resisting a draft Tobacco Bill which will see a more significant clamp down on advertising to promote tobacco products.
