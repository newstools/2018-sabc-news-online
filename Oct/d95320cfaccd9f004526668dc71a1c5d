The South African Communist Party (SACP)says it will volunteer information to the State Capture Commission of Inquiry. Commission Chair, judge Raymond Zondo has been appealing to government officials and political leaders to come forward with information which could assist the work of the commission. SACP General Secretary, Blade Nzimande ,made the announcement during the launch of the Red October campaign in Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga on Saturday. “We want to say we welcome the Zondo and also want to announce that as SACP will be going to give evidence at the Zondo Commission, there are people who are threatening us they are saying don’t come and present yourself with information.” Nzimande says the party also wants those found to have been involved in corruption to be arrested. Young Communist League (YCL) secretary, Mluleki Dlelanga, also expressed support for the Zondo Commission. He emphasized the need to choose leaders wisely as some are after positions for their own personal gain. He cited corruption and, tribalism as other challenges. “There is this zondo commission. We fully support it. It must continue. All those who have been doing wrong things must be brought to book. Now that there is Thuma mina we are saying Thuma Bona to Jail”. This year’s version of the Red October Campaign is themed – “Stop Corruption, Serve The People Selflessly.” Nzimande told party members and supporters among them alliance partners that dysfunctional municipalities contribute to challenges faced by communities. He says there is a need to strengthen local government to be able to respond to the needs of the people. Nzimande suggested that some project in municipalities should be given to community members instead of everything going through the tendering system. Nzimande told members that SACP members will volunteer information to the State Capture Commission despite threats. Watch video below:
