Five people have been killed and three others sustained injuries in a high-impact, horror head-on crash between two light motor vehicles on the N2 at Mtunzini in the north of KwaZulu-Natal. Four people died on impact, whilst one died in hospital. The driver of one of the vehicles had been burnt to death as he was trapped in the car which apparently ignited on impact. It’s believed that an entire family, who had been travelling in one of the vehicles from Swaziland to South Africa, were killed in the crash. KwaZulu-Natal Emergency Medical Rescue Services spokesperson, Robert McKenzie, says the cause of the crash is not known at this stage. “There has been a serious and tragic crash on the N2 highway near Mtunzini.
