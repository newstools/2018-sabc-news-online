The African National Congress (ANC) says it lost a fearless cadre with the passing of struggle stalwart Moses Chikane; and the country has lost a dedicated servant who was always committed to world peace. ANC members paid moving tributes to the 69 year old Chikane at his funeral in Mamelodi, Pretoria on Saturday morning. The Veteran died last week Wednesday after a long illness. Paying tribute to his father “Moss” Chikane on behalf of the family his son Thato Chikane described the ANC legend as a loving and caring person. Thato says the family enjoyed the love and tender care from the global family that his father managed to create through the political and liberation struggle work. Thato says the inclusive love his father had for his family and the nation made him the true servant of the people. “When I think of my father two words come to mind: love and sacrifice. He loved his people and he loved his family. As a matter of fact he loved all people just like he loved his family.” “He was a true servant of the people. He served the people because he truly loved them. For him, being a public servant wasn’t just a job, it was him. Doing his work made him happy.” Click video below:
