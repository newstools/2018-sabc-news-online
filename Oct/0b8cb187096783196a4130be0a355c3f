Nelson Mandela Bay ANC councillor and Political Head of Infrastructure in the metro, Andile Lungisa, has vowed to engage the party’s National Executive Committee (NEC) before deciding about his future as the Member of the Mayoral Committee (MMC). The NEC has instructed Lungisa to resign as the MMC as he has a pending criminal case. The message was communicated to the party’s regional structure by the Provincial Working Committe. Lungisa is out on bail pending a petition to the High Court for leave to appeal his effective 2-year jail term for assaulting DA councillor, Rano Kayser, during the infamous council meeting brawl of 2016. The ANC took a resolution during its 53rd National Conference in Mangaung that members facing allegations of improper misconduct must not hold public office. Lungisa maintains he was defending himself during the brawl. “When the member of the ANC is attacked what should you do. I cry like a small baby or I run like a baby. Do I defend myself under attack? That’s the engagement we need to have. That’s why I’m saying we need to engage internally, especially with the NEC because it was reported by the PWC that the NEC took a decision.”
