The Democratic Alliance (DA) has admitted that two investigative reports commissioned by the party on the governance of the City of Cape Town, point to alleged interference and misconduct by the outgoing Mayor Patricia de Lille. A 2 000 page report by law firm Bowman Gilfillan has been leaked to the media, allegedly finding that De Lille failed to report tender corruption. The report is alleged to also recommend that disciplinary action be taken by the Council against De Lille. DA spokesperson Solly Malatsi says they will wait for a council meeting later this week. “We are of the view that there’s a council meeting on Thursday where that report will be tabled, and we will comment once council has discussed that report and determined the outcome of it, and it highlights to serious allegations.”
