Parliament’s Communications Portfolio Committee has identified the candidates it wants to interview to fill the four vacancies on the SABC board. Of the 80 people who applied, 12 have been shortlisted. The committee says it wants candidates who have strong financial and human resource backgrounds. The four existing vacancies are as a result of resignations of former board members. The committee says it’s especially keen about the female chartered accountant candidates. Of the 12 shortlists, seven are women. The shortlisted names are:  Jones Kevan, Advocate Motshedi Lekalakala, Thabo Leshilo, Diliza Madikiza, Unathi Magwentshu, Vuyokazi Makhubalo, Mathews Mofokeng, Bernadette Muthien, Mergen Naidoo, Thozama Nene, Michael Nurick, and Jasmina Patel. The committee has called on South Africans to make comments about the candidates. Interviews will be conducted on the 30th of October.  For a related video click below:
