The Democratic Alliance is on Tuesday leading a march to submit a memorandum of demands to Limpopo Premier Stan Mathabatha. The party is demanding that Mathabatha take immediate action against individuals implicated in the multi-billion-rand VBS Mutual Bank scandal. DA provincial leader, Jacques Smalle says Mathabatha has failed to suspend all public representatives implicated. Smalle says the march stems from the very slow action being taken by the provincial government against implicated officials. He says: “We did see one or two cases where councils did take action but we haven’t actually seen action. The DA has laid charges but it is important that we move those people from office while they can influence financial decision-making within the municipality and distort information and documents. It’s a plea and demand to say to the premier you need to take action.” Related Videos
