Security has been beefed up at the Bram Fischer International Airport in Bloemfontein. The Airports Company South Africa (ACSA) says previous breaches meant upgrades were necessary. ACSA says it’s on high alert for any security breaches. Earlier this year a robbery took place and thus prompted increased security measures. Bram Fischer International Airport manager, Esmaralda Barnes, says the new and improved technology is important to keep passengers safe. “The security of our people is very important. That’s why we have upgraded and working with the SAPS, immigration, home affairs and SARS making sure that everything goes accordingly.” ACSA says the airport has injected almost R80 million in the country’s economy during the 2017 financial year, but it has experienced a decline in the passenger bookings. The solar plant is also part of the upgrades. It will produce 750 kilowatts and will boost the economy of the airport by cutting electricity costs. The solar plant project is expected to be completed by 2019.
