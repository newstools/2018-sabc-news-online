SARS has encouraged taxpayers to use the eFiling channel to submit their returns as the deadline looms. The deadline applies to non-provisional taxpayers and for those provisional taxpayers who opt to file at a branch, while provisional taxpayers using eFiling have until January 31, 2019 to file. Individual taxpayers have until close of business to file their personal income tax returns before tax season closes. SARS says, eFiling has experienced 99.7 percent uptime during Tax Season and is geared to receive the large volumes of returns that can easily spike to 150 000 submissions daily when Tax Season hits its last day.
