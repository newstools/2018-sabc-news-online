The Democratic Alliance (DA) leader, Mmusi Maimane has appealed to South Africans not to get carried away by the noise of politicians promising a smooth process of Land Expropriation without compensation. He says amending Section 25 of the Constitution could lead to a humanitarian crisis as many will suffer due to the corrupt nature the process is likely to follow. Maimane on Friday signed an agreement with opposition party leaders from Venezuela, who are fighting a land reform process in that country. “This, like it is having similar consequences here in South Africa – it encourages land invasions which reduce productivity to the extent that farms become idling and in fact they qualify as places for land expropriation without compensation. Land was allocated to political criteria and as the Motlanthe report suggests that it ends up being the political elite that end up owning land and not poor people,” adds Maimane. Venezuela is experiencing a severe economic crisis under the socialist policies of President Nicolas Maduro. Visiting MPs from the opposition party have warned of dire consequences if the state nationalises key institutions like the Reserve Bank. “Be warned of the gap between the speech and the reality. Because it’s easy to say I will give all the power to the people – but there is small letters in the contract, which always say the people is the government. Meaning without any doubt, I can be out of the power. And this gap between the speech and the reality is one of the first things that happened in Venezuela,” explains the DA leader.
