Women on the continent must be involved in key issues affecting their countries. This is the call that was made at a gender equality conference in Johannesburg. The Top Women Conference aims to fast track gender parity and women-driven economic growth by 2025. It is a gathering of respected business leaders featuring academics, government representatives and Chief Executive Officers from various sectors. “We need to be able to have conversations like these where we can be able to encourage each other. Let your gender not hold you back. We are seeking solutions to this beautiful country of ours,” says businesswoman Johanna Mukoki. The women want to find their own solutions to gender empowerment issues. Ambassador Sonto Kudjoe who has made strides in the country’s defence and security laments the shortage of women in this field. Another expert in information technology Public Sector Director at Microsoft SA Lillian Barnard says stereotypes have to be debunked. The gathering of the women coincides with the centenary celebrations of Albertina Sisulu, a struggle stalwart who fought against the oppression and inequality of women. Ndundu Sithole
