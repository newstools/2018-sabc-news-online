Limpopo police have foiled a move by angry residents, to shut down the offices of the Fetakgomo-Tubatse Municipality. A group of residents led by African National Congress (ANC) branches in the area are protesting against the R240 million investment made by the municipality with VBS bank. They are calling for the resignation of the municipal manager. Police told organisers of the protest that they did not request permission to march on time. Organisers say they applied for the permission two weeks ago. They say since then they had been waiting for the request to be granted. They say the delay could not deter them any further Organiser Themba Ngele says: “Two weeks ago we applied through the ANC, ANCYL and SANCO we don’t know who is dragging the process of their application since no one is calling us to give an update.” Police say they had to thwart the planned march in the interest of public order and safety. Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe, Police Spokesperson says: “Police don’t prevent people to engage in protests as it is their right but they must ensure that legal processes to apply for permission to march must be followed.” Residents say they will regroup and organise another march.
