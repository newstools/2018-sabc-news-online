Over 2000 grade twelve learners in the North West are participating in Spring Camps taking place in 78 centres across the province. Departmental spokesperson Freddy Sepeng says the programme seeks to assist learners from underperforming schools, technical schools and progressed learners with problematic learning areas, to intensify better year-end results. Sepeng says they are aiming to improve from last year’s results after the past year showed a 3.06 percent drop. “As the department we are ready and well prepared because since Friday, our top officials have been monitoring all the camps. Everything is running smoothly and we are prepared this year to come up with good results and we would like to thank parents for allowing the children to come to the camps,” said Sepeng.
