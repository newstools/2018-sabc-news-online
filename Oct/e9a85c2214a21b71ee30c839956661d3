The Limpopo government has revised the number of people who died in the multiple-vehicle crash on the N1 on Friday to 26. Earlier reports had put the figure at 27. Emotions were high when the bereaved families identified their loved ones at Mokopane Hospital earlier on Sunday.  Most of the relatives had traveled from the Senwabarwana area where a 22-seater taxi which was involved in the crash was coming from. Martha Teffo lost her 20-year-old niece in the tragedy. “This has hurt us deeply. I last saw her just before the trip. She promised to call me as soon as she arrived at her destination. When I prepared food, she said I should leave her portion in the pot because she wanted heavy rain to fall on the day of her funeral. I didn’t know she was saying goodbye. I will miss her so much because we were so close.” Limpopo Premier Stan Mathabatha has assured families of the 26 people who died in the multiple-vehicle crash on the N1 that the provincial government will assist with burial arrangements. Mathabatha met with the bereaved families at Mokopane Hospital. Apart from the Road Accident Fund assistance, government will ensure that the deceased are given dignified burials and that their relatives receive counselling. “Let me send my condolences and that of the entire provincial government to the families and also say to them that, as a provincial government, we are there for them all the time. There is a team that has been established by the provincial government led by MEC Makhurupetsa and MEC Ramathuba. So, that is why I’m saying the families must feel free to raise whatever they want to raise,” says Premier Mathabatha. Click below for more on the story:
