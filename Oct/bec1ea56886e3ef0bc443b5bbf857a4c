The four presidential investment envoys will visit the United States next week, building on the momentum of the successful South Africa Investment Summit in Sandton. Various companies used the summit to commit to R290 billion in upcoming investment, with pledges of another R400 billion in the future. President Cyril Ramaphosa earlier appointed former finance minister Trevor Manuel, former deputy finance minister Mcebisi Jonas, and business people Jaco Maree and Phumzile Langeni as investment envoys. Manuel says the campaign to attract investors will now be taken to major financial hubs of the world. “We need to get out there and be talking to people – part of what we are doing is we going to the US next week. But New York is a financial capital to get the capital out of the US. You need to move to the mid-west to cities like Chicago, Detroit go to the west coast and it can’t just be a visit the US.”
