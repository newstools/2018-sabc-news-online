Two alleged rhino poaching kingpins Joe Nyalunga and Sydney Mabuza are expected to appear in the White River Magistrateâ€™s Court in Mpumalanga for a bail application on Friday. The two together with their five co-accused who are police officials are facing several cases of rhino poaching that allegedly occurred in the Kruger National Park. The Hawks investigative officer Leroy Pieter Bruwser has told the court last week that the suspects operated underground. Bruwser says Nyalunga and Mabuza work together with the police at the Skukuza Police Station. He further says the police were transporting the poachers to and from the park.
