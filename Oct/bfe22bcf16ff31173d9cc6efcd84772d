Limpopo premier Stan Mathabatha is on Sunday expected to address the families of the multiple vehicle crash victims at Mokopane hospital. Twenty-Seven people, including two children, were killed when a truck which had a tyre burst collided with several vehicles on the N1 between Kranskop toll plaza and Nylplaza on Friday. This included a 22 seater taxi from Bochum, north-west of Polokwane. Premier spokesperson Kenny Mathivha says, “The premier will be leading a delegation of MEC of Transport, Makoma Makhurupetje and MEC for Health, Dr Phophi Ramathuba with the bereaved families – to identify the more than 26 people perished in the road accident few days ago at Mokopane hospital and other areas surround Mokopane, on Sunday morning.”
