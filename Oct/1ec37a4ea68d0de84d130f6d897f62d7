Police minister Bheki Cele officially launches the Tactical Response Team (TRT) dedicated to the Westbury policing precinct in Johannesburg. This is part of the broader strategy to fight the scourge of drugs and gang-related violence in the area. Community members embarked on protests in the past few days to raise their plight. A mother was shot and killed and her niece wounded in cross-fire between rival gangs.
