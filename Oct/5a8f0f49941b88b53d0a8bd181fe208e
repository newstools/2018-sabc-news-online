Energy expert, Chris Yelland says people can expect electricity price increases starting the 1st of April next year. This after energy regulator, Nersa gave power utility Eskom the go-ahead to recover R32-billion of costs incurred over the past three years through higher tariffs. This will occur over a four-year period from 2019 to 2023. Cash-strapped Eskom is battling to emerge from governance and financial difficulties. Yelland says we can expect a price increase two to three times the inflation rate from 1 April 2019. He says:”There is the normal annual price increase for the next three years. That application is applying for a 15% increase per year for three years, which is extremely high. However in addition to that, what has already been determined and granted by Nersa is a further price increase that will come into effect on 1 April 2019 of 4.1%. So the combination means there could be an increase of up to 19.1%.”
