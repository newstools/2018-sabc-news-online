ANC councillor in Ward 88 Sbu Maphumulo was on Thursday shot dead in Umlazi, south of Durban. According to spokesperson for the ANC in KwaZulu-Natal Nomagugu Simelane Zulu, Maphumulo was on his way home from a meeting with other party members when they were ambushed. She says: “We understand that around 9pm Thursday night, Mapumulo was shot and killed. He was coming back home from a programme that he had earlier with a number of comrades. He was not alone when he was shot. While the comrades were busy trying to help comrade Sbu, the assailants ran away and got into a car and drove off.” Zulu says what’s worrying is that Maphumulo was threatened earlier in the day. “What worries us is that we are made to understand that Thursday morning a group of people who said they were community members marched towards the counsellors home and threatened to burn the house. The same evening, the counsellor is shot and killed. So we do not know if the two issues are connected but it is a worrying factor.”
