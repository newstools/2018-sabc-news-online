Community leaders in Diepsloot, north of Johannesburg, have encouraged residents to get screened for cancers. The community held a cancer awareness walk earlier on Saturday. During the walk, Gauteng Health MEC Gwen Ramakgopa said her department had invested heavily in strengthening its response to the explosion of cancer in the province. She also says she will soon announce major investments in improving cancer treatment in the province. Community leader Sicelo Shezi says, “We want to make people aware of this kind of a disease because this disease has killed so many people in SA. I think people will listen and understand it very clear so that they will keep the practice. We want a healthy community so that we build a healthy nation.”
