President Cyril Ramaphosa has outlined his expectations of the individual who is to take over as the new Director of Public Prosecutions.  This after the Constitutional Court ruled that the appointment of Shaun Abrahams as the NPA head was illegal – and former head Mxolisi Nxasana’s payout, after he was fired by former president Jacob Zuma, was also unconstitutional. He was addressing South African diplomats at the Heads of Missions conference in Pretoria. Ramaphosa says the appointee will not be a captured person. “We are now moving forward to appoint a new NDPP. A panel is in place to interview a plethora of people and they will select a few names and we are hoping that the appointee will be a person who will not be captured, who will make sure that our criminal justice system is well. That is the last person we would ever want to be captured. We want them to be as slippery from the hands of capturers as possible.” Ramaphosa has invited legal organisations and independent public institutions to assist in identifying and selecting individuals for consideration for the position of NDPP.
