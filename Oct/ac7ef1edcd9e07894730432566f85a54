Democratic Alliance (DA) leader, Mmusi Maimane, has refused to answer questions about the fate of Cape Town mayor Patricia de Lille. Maimane led a picket outside police offices in Durban on Saturday. Earlier this week De Lille said she was considering her next move after the council adopted two reports one of which accused her of hiding corruption within the council. Earlier this year, the party announced that it had reached an agreement with Cape Town mayor Patricia de Lille to vacate her position but this may no longer happen. Five DA council members, led by chief whip Shaun August, resigned from the council, this week. They alleged that there was racism in the DA.  Maimane refused to answer questions about the latest developments saying that questions about De Lille’s fate should be directed to the people of the Western Cape. When further asked about what he was going to do about the matter, Maimane said he was not there to talk about De Lille. Maimane used the occasion to call on police authorities to work closely with members of Parliament to ensure the safety of its citizens. He handed over a memorandum demanding that police in the province retract their circular instructing station commanders not to allow MP’s to conduct unannounced visits. The party has given the police 14 days to respond. Watch video below:
