The trial of controversial Nigerian pastor Timothy Omotoso will resume in the High Court in Port Elizabeth on Monday. This comes after emotional testimony by 22-year-old Cheryl Zondi last week. She detailed the violations she’d endured when Omotoso allegedly sexually assaulted her when she was 14. Omotoso and two accused face a total of 97 charges, ranging from trafficking for sexual purposes and racketeering to rape and sexual assault, targeting members of Omotoso’s Jesus Dominion International Church. Zondo’s testimony caught defence advocate Peter Daubermann by surprise. Her testimony forced prosecutor Nceba Ntelwa to ask for an amendment to the charge sheet.  Daubermann asked that the case be postponed to Monday, so he can familiarise himself with the revised charge sheet and prepare his defence. Her testimony revealed shocking details causing her to break down often. Zondi said the sexual exploitation lasted throughout her high school years. However, Omotoso supporters are adamant that he is falsely accused. A spokesperson for the church, Osuagwu Chukx, says they find it unjust that Omotoso is kept behind bars. Watch for more:
