The African National Congress (ANC) Gauteng chief whip Brian Hlongwa has resigned. Hlongwa’s resignation comes as the party’s Integrity Committee is expected to release a statement on their decison following an investigation into his and former Health MEC Qedani Mahlangu’s conduct. Hlongwa has been implicated in alleged corruption amounting to R1.2 billion while he was MEC of Health. The election of Brian Hlongwa and Qedani Mahlangu into the ANC’s provincial executive committee recently caused an uproar. The two have been entangled in high profile cases with Hlongwa being implicated in alleged corruption amounting to R1.2 billion while he was Health MEC. The ANC caucus in the Gauteng legislature has released a statement announcing Hlongwa’s resignation as chief whip. In the statement Hlongwa says he has decided to resolve the eight year long accusations and and that these accusations have not been tested in court. He says he cannot continue as chief whip as this would distract the party from its mandate.
