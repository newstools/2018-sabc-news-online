Judge Mandela Makaula has dismissed the application to recuse himself from the Omotoso case. This comes after Peter Daubermann, Omotoso’s lawyer applied on behalf of his client and co-accused that the Judge recuses himself from the case. Daubermann said his client will not receive a fair trial. Daubermann asked for the recusal due to remarks Judge Mandela Makaula made during the trial, accusing him of being biased in the case. According to the judge the application has no merit. Daubermann says he will appeal the decision and has asked for a postponement of three days to enable a senior council to prepare.  The rape trial resumed on Monday morning in the High Court in Port Elizabeth. The first witness, 22-year-old Cheryl Zondi, testified last week alleging that Omotoso sexually groomed and raped her since she was 14-years-old. He allegedly abused 30 teenage girls. The state has indicated that it would call the second witness on Monday.
