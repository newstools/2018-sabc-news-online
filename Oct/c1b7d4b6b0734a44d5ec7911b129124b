Pupils from 20 schools in the Inanda area, north of Durban have staged a protest calling for the reintroduction of corporal punishment in schools. Learners argue that most of their schoolmates are out of control and have become violent. One of the students says: “I feel corporal punishment has to come back now as students have too much freedom and we misusing that freedom. Students are not respecting teachers because nothing is going to be done to them. Students smoke dagga inside school premises knowing teachers will not do anything.” Community members echoed the calls for corporal punishment to be brought back saying most of the violent crimes taking place in their community have young people involved due to a lack of discipline. Parents say government should revisit its policy when it comes to this. They met with the teachers to find a way to get the department of education to consider bringing back corporal punishment.
