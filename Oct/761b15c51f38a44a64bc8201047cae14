Police have arrested a man in Wynberg, north of Johannesburg for possession of suspected stolen goods with an estimated value of between R1.5 and R2 million. The joint operation with National Intelligence took place on Friday at a second hand goods dealership. Uncut diamonds, ivory, cash in various currencies and top brand jewellery were among the seized items. Police have warned the public to avoid purchasing unusually cheap luxury items in the wake of the festive season. SAPS Gauteng spokesperson, Mathapelo Peters says: “We caution the public to be very careful and selective in their search for bargains, especially when shopping at secondhand goods dealerships. Possession of stolen property is a criminal offense, irrespective of how and where the property was obtained.” “Members of the public are encouraged to continue collaborating with the police by reporting any suspicious criminal activities on the Crime Stop number 08600 10111 or at any police station,” adds Peters.
