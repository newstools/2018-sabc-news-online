The case of 19 people arrested over an attack on a mosque and a spate of incendiary devices placed at shopping malls in KwaZulu-Natal, will continue behind closed doors in the Verulam Magistrate’s Court on Tuesday. They made their first appearance on Monday. They were arrested last week on charges including murder, attempted murder, offences relating to explosive devices, arson, extortion and terrorism. The media were not allowed inside the courtroom. Hawks Spokesperson Hangwani Mulaudzi says the court appearance was in camera to avoid jeopardising the investigation. “We view this matter in a very serious light. We requested the court to give us time so that we can finalise these investigations. There are issues that we still have to deal with like your ID parades. We felt that if we have to bring in the media and any other persons, it will be to the detriment of our investigations. So this is not a blanket barring of the media. We are just asking for a few days.” Watch the video below for related news:
