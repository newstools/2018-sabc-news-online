Outgoing Cape Town Mayor, Patricia de Lille, says she will not be campaigning for the DA ahead of next year’s general elections. De Lille will leave her position at the end of the month following protracted battles with the DA. De Lille says she remains a member of the party. “Politics is about the heart and is about the head, and you need to find that combination, I mean my love for politics is about heart stories , and honestly I wont be able to go and stand and campaign after what has happened to me. It will be very very difficult for me, and so no I wont be able to do it.” Watch related video below:
