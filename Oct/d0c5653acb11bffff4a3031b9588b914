The Economic Freedom Fighter (EFF) has suspended its seven councillors in the eThekwini Metro, for the alleged squandering of party caucus funds. The party funds were meant to be used to purchase things like stationery. The councillors are said to have failed to account for the funds, which includes producing audited financial statements, as to how the money was used. EFF KZN provincial chairperson, Vusi Khoza, says the party has instituted an internal investigation, and that disciplinary action will be taken against them, if found guilty. “They are suspended on allegations that they have misused or failed to account for party funds. Because they could not account as to what has happened to the money, and how they used it, we decided as EFF to suspend them pending investigation – and one of the conditions for their suspension is that they must not attend municipal business on behalf of the EFF as well as party programmes,” says Khoza.
