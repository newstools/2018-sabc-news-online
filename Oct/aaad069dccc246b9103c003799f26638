AmaZulu King Goodwill Zwelithini is demanding that government gives him a written and signed assurance that the land under the Ingonyama Trust Board will not be expropriated. Earlier this year during an imbizo, King Zwelithini expressed his fears that his land was being targeted. This comment forced African National Congress (ANC) President Cyril Ramaphosa to hold an urgent meeting with King Zwelithini where he reassured His Majesty that his land is safe. However addressing scores of people during the uMkhosi weLembe at Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durban King Zwelithini said he wants written and signed agreement. “It is disappointing that the president has not come back to me. We only hear that he says he reassures us he will not take our land. We do not have a problem with his statement however we are awaiting for a meeting with him. He must sign an agreement that he will not take our land and no one will touch it in future.” King Zwelithini has also criticised the Constitutional Court ruling legalising the usage of dagga in private spaces. He says this will destroy the nation. “I kindly ask that they forgive me in KZN about dagga. Our children are already destroyed by dagga. So they even mix it with a pot scrapper. I kneel before the government and the Constitutional Court; they must stop embarrassing themselves before other nations for allowing drugs.” Click below for more on the story:
