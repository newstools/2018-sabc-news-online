The African National Congress (ANC) will release the much anticipated outcomes of its National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting held at the weekend this Monday afternoon. The governing partyâ€™s highest decision making body in between conferences discussed a wide range of issues with an emphasis on unity ahead of the 2019 national elections. Although not on the agenda, insiders say the gathering also pondered on the so-called plot against President Cyril Ramaphosa by some senior party members. In his political report to the ANC NEC on Friday, Ramaphosa called for unity insisting that working together is not an option for the governing party as it prepares for the sixth democratic elections scheduled before the end of May next year. Another milestone for the meeting is endorsing the mandate and the independence of their Integrity Commission now with powers to investigate any member without fear or favour. The recently appointed Provincial Task Team (PTT) in the North West also featured with talks that those against the PTT have challenged it in court with former Provincial Chair Supra Muhamapelo threatening to withdraw his participation.
