More than 30 undocumented migrants have been arrested during a crime prevention operation in Johannesburg. The operation involving police and city officials was targeted at hijacked buildings in the city. City of Joburg’s Lucky Sindane says there are over 700 hijacked buildings in the city. He says more than 30 of these have since been handed back to their rightful owners. Sindane says the city is taking harsh action against landlords who take advantage of vulnerable, desperate people and accommodating them in deplorable conditions. “In Hillbrow and Berea at multiple hijacked properties, a total of 33 undocumented foreign nationals were arrested, and one suspect was also arrested for being in possession of a dangerous weapon. The suspects will appear at the Hillbrow magistrates court on Monday.”
