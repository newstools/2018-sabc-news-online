The High Court in Port Elizabeth has adjourned until after lunch in the case of Nigerian pastor, Timothy Omotoso. The first witness Cheryl Zondi continued answering gruelling questions from Omotosoâ€™s defence lawyer Peter Dauberman. On Monday, presiding Judge Mandela Makuala did not allow graphic questions that defence Advocate Daubermann was trying to put to Zondi. Omotoso allegedly trafficked more than 30 girls and women who were from various branches of his church to a house in Umhlanga, KwaZulu-Natal, where he allegedly sexually exploited them. Earlier Zondi explained that one of the reasons she went back to the church after the abuse was to get an apology from Omotoso for what he had done to her and get some closure to her ordeal.
