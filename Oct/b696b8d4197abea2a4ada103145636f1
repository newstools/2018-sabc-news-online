Sexual and gender-based violence comes under the spotlight at the One Young World Summit currently under way at The Hague, Netherlands. This against the backdrop of shocking statistics that reveal that one in three women and girls – and one in six men and boys worldwide will experience some form of sexual or gender-based violence in their lifetime. Almost two thousand delegates from all over the world have converged in the Netherlands for this year’s “One Young World” summit. The summit – which is in its ninth year – provides a global forum that connects young leaders with the common goal of creating lasting positive change around the world.  The Hague is dubbed the City of peace and justice. It is home to the International Court of Justice and the International Criminal Court. Mayor of The Hague, Pauline Krikke explains the significance of the city hosting the Summit. It is thus fitting that this year’s One Young World Summit – seeking to create a better world – is being held here. Climate change, Poverty, Human Rights and the state of the economy are just few of the topics on the agenda. But just how much talking can aid the troubles of the world, the delegates will gather for the next few days., sharing, listening, learning…and perhaps most importantly – exploring new ideas to inspire change and indeed be the future they want to see in the world. – Lumko Jimlongo and Thabo Madilola
