Several communities from the south of Johannesburg have marched to the City of Johannesburg’s regional office in Ennerdale to demand better service delivery in informal settlements. Residents of Ennerdale, Lawley, Vlakfontein and Orange Farm say they have been waiting for development in their areas for years but instead, government had taken them to court for illegal land invasion. March organiser Alfred Mxunya says the government is failing to provide basic services such as housing, water and sanitation in many communities. “This march is about all squatter camps in region G: five of them. We want government to proclaim these squatter camps and they must have basic services like water, electricity and sanitation. We say to government we need these services because it’s our right in the constitution and that is what we are demanding from government.”
