Tourism month has come and gone but the focus remains on this sector that is of crucial importance for the South African economy. Tourism Minister, Derek Hanekom, has welcomed the relaxation of visa regulations that made it harder for families with children to travel to South Africa. South Africa will implement a number of visa-related reforms that will make it easier for tourists and business people to come into the country. Heâ€™s also welcomed the stimulus plan announced by President Cyril Ramaphosa, with a focus on tourism. The Minister joins us in the studio.
