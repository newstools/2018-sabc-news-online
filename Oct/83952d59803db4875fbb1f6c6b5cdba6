Port Elizabeth beach was painted pink on Saturday as more than 13 000 people participated in the Big Walk for Cancer on Saturday morning. It was aimed at supporting cancer patients, survivors and honour those who lost their lives to this disease. The participants came dressed in pink, with t-shirts of remembrance on their backs, big banners commemorating their loved ones and silly hats to embrace the day. Though it was a very emotional walk for some of the participants, all thoroughly enjoyed it. “We just not even walking for ourselves it’s just to create awareness and just keep the awareness going. I’m a breast cancer survivor. We really need to do this hey, they need our help they need our prayers, they really need all the support they can get because I’m sure the pain that they suffering. I mean the little bit that we are suffering now is not as much as they are,” add some of the participants. Meanwhile, Gavin Kester from Cancer Association in the Eastern Cape has encouraged men to get tested. “It is our responsibility as men and women to take your partner or husband to the doctor to say come let’s test you for prostate cancer,” adds Kester.
