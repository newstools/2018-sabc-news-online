Students at the Tshwane University of Technology‘s (TUT) two Soshanguve campuses are expected to resume with academic activities on Monday. Lectures at the institution were suspended for more than a month following violent protests after the killing of a student, Katlego Monareng allegedly at the hands of police. TUT Student Representative Council says they welcome the reopening, despite their demands for justice for Katlego Monareng not having been met. University’s spokesperson Willa de Ruyter says security has been beefed up to ensure students’ safety. “ Residences are already opened for students and students must make sure to bring their SA ID’s and proof of 2018 admission cards as they will not be allowed access any other gates ( without the SA ID’s and admission cards).” Click below for more on the story:
