The assault cases involving Democratic Alliance (DA) Midvaal Mayor, Bongani Baloyi and an African National Congress (ANC) member in Sedibeng Region have been provisionally withdrawn due to lack of evidence. They appeared in the Vereeniging Magistrates Court in Gauteng on Monday. Baloyi and Rembuluwani Malange were both arrested on Saturday after they laid assault charges against each other. They were released the same day on bail of R500 each. The two were allegedly involved in a physical fight during a launch of the municipality’s Arbor Day at Savannah City. Baloyi says he still does not understand why he was arrested in the first place. “The same individual that assaulted me goes and opens a counter case. I think that was a bizarre decision that was taken by the police and I think I must apply my mind and determine what the best recourse on the judgement is. I’m comfortable to continue in a case that he reported me because I know I’m innocent.”
