The average dam levels in the Western Cape have decreased slightly since the end of the winter season. Provincial Spokesperson James-Brent Stayn says dam levels currently stand at 65.7%. He says they are concerned about the Karoo where water levels have dropped to below 20%. “We also see that the City of Cape Town is a bit better than the average for the province with the average dam levels standing at 75.2%. Major dams in the province are much better off than last year at this time. We see the Theewaterskloof dam above 58% full; that’s the biggest dam in the province. Earlier this year, that dam was standing below 6%.”
