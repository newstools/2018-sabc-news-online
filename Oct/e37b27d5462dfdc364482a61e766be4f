Environmental Affairs Minister Edna Molewa’s official funeral service is held at the Tshwane Events Centre this Saturday morning, were President Cyril Ramaphosa will be delivering the eulogy. Molewa passed away at a local hospital two weeks ago at the age of 61 and will be buried at the Zandfontein cemetery in Pretoria West. Several roads in the Pretoria CBD will be closed during the funeral service.  Earlier the funeral procession of Environmental Affairs Minister Edna Molewa has left the family home in Waterkloof, Pretoria East. A military hearse, which carried Molewa’s casket, headed to the Tshwane Event Centre where the full official service will take place. Molewa’s brother Fana Mphethi says it’s a sad day for the family. Environmental Affairs spokesperson Albi Modise said, “The service at the Event Centre is expected to start just after the arrival around 08h00 where President Cyril Ramaphosa is expected to deliver a key note address.” “Friends, cabinet ministers, family members and various South Africans from all walks of life who have been touched by the passing on of Minister Molewa’s work, and professionalism and who have also worked very well with he, will also form part of our opportunity to celebrate her life and will also reflect her good life,” added Modise. Dr Edna Molewa has been described as a hard worker by various people, including her colleagues in Parliament and environmental activists here at home and abroad.
