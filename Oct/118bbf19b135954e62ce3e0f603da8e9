Cape Town mayor-elect, Dan Plato, is campaigning for the Democratic Alliance (DA) at Concordia in Knysna in the Western Cape ahead of by-elections on October the 24th. The ward became vacant following the death of ANC councillor, Victor Molosi. He was shot and killed outside his home in July. Plato says it’s time for a change in Ward eight. ” My key message to the public is to vote for the DA, because we are the true alternative government for SA. Any vote for the ANC is a vote for an inherent corrupt political party. Looking at all the evidence that are released currently through the Zondo Commission’s investigations. So that’s the key central theme of my visit,” says Plato. Meanwhile, Western Cape ANC secretary, Faiez Jacobs, says  Molosi served the community well and so will their next candidate. ” The ANC will continue that tradition of servant leadership. We’re calling on Knysna’s community to continue supporting the ANC in the upcoming by-election. Support our candidate and also what they stand for as the character of servant leadership, commitment to governance and clean governance.”
