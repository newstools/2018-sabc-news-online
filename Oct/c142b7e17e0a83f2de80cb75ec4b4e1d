Firefighters say they have managed to control the fire in the Storms River area, in the Eastern Cape, after winds died down. The veld fire which started two days ago, was fanned by strong winds, resulting in evacuations in some parts of the area. Koukamma municipal mayor Samuel Vuso says they will ask for more resources to be sent, as they only rely on four fire engines. Vuso said, “A number of people were evacuated in some areas of Storms River, such as Boskor. However they returned home after the blaze, which threatened their properties was controlled. The mountains in the area were lit with orange light, stretching towards the N2 next to Storms River village, throughout the night.” “There were also concerns about the petrol station near the N2 and the Storms River bridge. However the fire is now under control and is being monitored,” added Vuso.
