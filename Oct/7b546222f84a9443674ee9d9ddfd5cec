Cape Town police say detectives are working around the clock to find the killers of an African National Congress (ANC) ward councillor at Wallacedene, in Kraaifontein. 44-year-old Luyanda Mbele was shot and killed after dropping off a family member in the area on Sunday night. His cousin was also killed in the incident. Described as a hardworking and loving family man and dedicated ward councillor, Luyanda Mbele and his cousin Mzwandile Mathenjwa, were shot and killed. The attack has shocked family members and residents. Irene Lester, a community member, says: “There were people laying there. I didn’t see the guys shooting, I just saw people lying there.” The ANC in the Western Cape says Mbele was a loyal and dedicated councillor. Faeiz Jacobs, ANC Western Cape Provincial Secretary says: “This is a great loss to the movement in the city and the province as a whole. Comrade Luyanda was a product of the ANC youth league in the area and had contributed over many years to youth development. “He was very active in local football and at one stage had served as the chairperson of the Bloekombos Football Association. He was very involved as a leader of united commuter’s voice. He was an activist for safe, reliable and affordable public transport.” The motive for the attack is part of the double murder investigation. ANC PEC member, Elese Depouch, was also gunned down outside his Crossroads home in March.
