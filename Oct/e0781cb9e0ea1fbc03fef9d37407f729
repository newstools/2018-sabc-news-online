Western Cape Premier Helen Zille has called on national government to deploy more police officers to the province to effectively combat crime, drugs and gangsterism. Zille and a number of provincial ministers briefed the media on these and other demands in Cape Town. She says the deployment of the gang unit is most welcome, but should be bolstered by a thousand more skilled and well-trained police personnel. “I would like to see the permanent presence of additional police capacity in our most threatened police precincts which is what our demand is and I would like to see them not just popping up like mushrooms after the rain before an election.” The Western Cape Minister for Community Safety, Dan Plato, says additional police will immediately improve the current work being done to combat gangsterism among others. “Confidence will be installed in the minds of the public if the police are in a more forceful dramatic way begin to arrest the top drug lords and the top gang bosses. Because they are the people in charge of the all gangster groupings. They are the people that give the necessary orders and those arrested are just the runners. They are just the small fry.”
