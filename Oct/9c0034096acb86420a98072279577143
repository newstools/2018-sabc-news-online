The province is gearing up for the start of its provincial elective conference in East London this weekend.

A South African Reserve Bank report fingers the party’s deputy president, Floyd Shivambu, say he received  R10 million  in the VBS bank scandal. The EFF in the province says this is just cheap politics trying to distract the nation from the land issue. EFF Convenor in the Eastern Cape Marshall Dlamini, “He says they will not be side-tracked in voting for land expropriation without compensation.” EFF members in the province are visibly excited to vote for new leadership.
