Community leaders in Westbury have held a closed meeting in Eldorado Park, south of Johannesburg to try to come up with a way forward, amid the Westbury protests. One of the meeting organisers, Anthony Williams says, “We are not happy with what Minister Bheki Cele said. It is the same thing he said in the Western Cape. There’s no clear plan from this government to root out corruption of cops, because that’s where it starts from.” Police spent Tuesday night keeping a close watch at the troubled township of Westbury, following two days of violent protests, which were triggered by the shooting of a woman and her child during an exchange of fire, allegedly between rival drug gangs. Cele met with the community on Tuesday and has promised to crackdown on criminal elements.
