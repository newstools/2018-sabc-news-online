At least 31 people were killed when a landslide rolled down the slopes of Mt. Elgon in eastern Uganda, wrecking homes and burying animals, a government official told Reuters on Friday. Martin Owor, Commissioner for Disaster Preparedness and Management, said the landslides tumbled down onto a small town on the mountainâ€™s slopes on Thursday afternoon. The area, close to the border with Kenya, is prone to landslides and there have been several similar accidents in recent years.
