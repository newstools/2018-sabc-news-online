The Nigerian community in Nelson Mandela Bay has pleaded with public not to paint them with the same brush as the televangelist Nigerian Pastor Timothy Omotoso. Omotoso is currently on trial in the Port Elizabeth High Court. Foreign nationals living in the friendly city have condemned Omotoso’s alleged offences but have called on the South African Judiciary to conduct a fair and unbiased trial. The rape trial will resume in the Port Elizabeth High Court on Thursday. The Omotoso rape trial has been far reaching. Gender activists are standing in solidarity across the country. Gender activists travelled from the Western Cape to give support to alleged victims. The campaign titled “hands off my vagina” is also seeking to have Church’s regulated. Lucinda Evans says:”We are here to motivate the activist. Churches should be regulated, be screened and should have child protection policies.” The billboard on the Jesus Dominion International Church was taken down following protest action by civic organisations. Forty eight witnesses are still set to testify and 30 are believed to be the alleged victims of Omotoso witnesses that have also reportedly been threatened. A source close to the Idols Twins says Neliswa and Anele who came out in 2017 exposing Omotoso say they received death threats despite being in witness protection. They are also going to testify. Omotoso and two co-accused Zukiswa Sitho and Lusanda Sulani are facing 97 sex related charges. Click video below:
