A 28 year-old pastor accused of raping a 15 year old congregant has been remanded in custody. The pastor appeared briefly before the magistrate in Mkhuhlu, Bushbuckridge. The community is divided. Church members are rallying behind the pastor while locals want to burn his church. Members of the Prophetic Ministry waited in anticipation on the outcome of the court case.  They support their pastor. Congregant Delisile Mvubu says; ‘We are here to support our pastor until justice takes its course. “ Apparently the pastor tried twice to molest the victim and failed. He only succeeded the third time. The victim’s distraught family wants justice. ‘I keep thinking about my child, that is my blood. I am very much concerned,” says victim’s father Joseph Ndlovu. The victim’s mother Mavis Unisi says; ‘I am happy today that the lady came forward. What happened to my child in 2016 was not good.’ The suspect’s legal representative says the case is weak. “The case is none existent. We will come for bail application on the 11th. There will be witnesses, ‘” says lawyer Tshepiso Radebe. More people are understood to be contemplating pressing charges against the man of the cloth. The case has been postponed to next Thursday for a bail application. Author- Siphephile Kunene
