Its a month away from the African National Congress (ANC) list conference, and the ANC Youth League in the Northern Cape has endorsed ANC Provincial Chairperson Zamani Saul as the next premier of the province. The league believes Saul is a better candidate to replace current Premier Sylvia Lucas, which the league has previously supported. It has already released its list of names that they see fit for government positions across the province including potential MECs. ANC Youth League Secretary, Xhanti Teki says Saul has a track record that proves that he would be able to improve the economy of the province. “He has shown overtime that he is a tried and tested leader. When in fact he emerges as a leader, the province will be on a more upward trajectory. The list that we are releasing is a unifying list. It cuts across and it accommodates the leagues, the alliance. We don’t want our legislature to be an old-age home,” says Teki.
