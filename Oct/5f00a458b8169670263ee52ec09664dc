National Police Commissioner General Khehla Sitole has condemned the killing of police officer, who was shot and killed while on duty in Port Elizabeth. Police Spokesperson Vish Naidoo says the officer was found with a bullet wound in the head and was still in possession of his service pistol. The 36-year-old constable from the Mount Road cluster was allegedly followed by a silver grey vehicle, with two occupants. He called for back-up, but by the time police got to him he was already dead. Naidoo said, “Nothing was taken from him. So the motive for the killing is unknown at this stage. His service pistol as well as other items were still in his possession and of course, the national commissioner has instructed that a 72-hour activation plan be implemented and this will entail the mobilisation of critical resources of the SAPS to ensure that no evidence or intelligence is lost.” Naidoo urges anyone with information relating to this incident to come forward.
