Residents from 55 villages in Giyani in Limpopo are still experiencing water shortages despite a multi-billion rand water supply project. A company, Khato Civils, has been paid R2.9 billion to upgrade the local water scheme. The company has stopped work on the project at 94% to completion due to non-payment by the Department of Water Affairs and Lepelle Northern Water Board. Residents of Shivulani, Mbatlo, Mavalani and other villages which were set to benefit from the R3.5 billion project, say the situation is worse than it was before Khato Civils started work. Meanwhile, President Cyril Ramaphosa has made a commitment to visit the area soon. President Cyril Ramaphosa’s Giyani visit loading .
