The man from the Springs ‘House of Horrors’ has been sentenced to effectively 35 years in prison at the High Court in Pretoria. He was convicted of trying to beat his 11-year-old boy to death and raping his 16-year-old daughter in 2014 as well as abusing and neglecting all five of his children. The mother of the children was sentenced to five years suspended for 5 years, on the condition that she is not found guilty of child neglect and using drugs. She must also undergo psychological therapy. Judge Eben Jordaan said the mother is not a good candidate for a custodial sentence because she was also subjected to continuous abuse and was found to be a battered woman.
