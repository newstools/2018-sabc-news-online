A 61-year-old man accused of molesting a 10-year-old boy is to appear at the Calcutta Magistrate’s court in Mkhuhlu near Hazyview in Mpumalanga on Monday. The alleged incident took place at the suspect’s home after the boy went missing for a day last month. The family of the victim says they realised that the child was molested after one of them noted that he had difficulties walking. The community is expected to protest outside court on Monday morning.
