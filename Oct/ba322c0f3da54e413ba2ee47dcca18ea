Finance Minister Tito Mboweni says the past nine years have destroyed the confidence of many good black professionals who had offered to work in the public sector. Mboweni was addressing black professionals at the Association of Black Securities and Investment Professionals conference in Sandton, Johannesburg on Friday. The Finance minister has urged black professionals to continue to seek excellence in the wake of failed state-owned enterprises (SOE’s)and other black-related businesses. He says access to finance remains the biggest challenge for black entrepreneurs. “You talk about State owned enterprises where you guys have been there to run them and very few have been successful. And you want to add a bank to that, so when you talk through these issues here you are as professionals, can you go into these institutions and make a difference think beyond the squatter camp. But we need access to finance.”
