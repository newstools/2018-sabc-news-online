Cheryl Zondi, the first witness in the trial of controversial pastor, Timothy Omotoso will face another gruelling day of cross examination in the High Court in Port Elizabeth on Wednesday. Zondi is one of the members of Omotoso’s church who accuse him of sexual assault. On Tuesday, defence advocate Peter Daubermann showed a total of three videos where she appeared in a jovial mood. In one of the videos, she is seen telling the church that she was overwhelmed by the love she received there. During cross examination, Zondi told the court that she was actually not telling the truth in parts during that speech to the church but did it for the sake of Omotoso. Daubermann focused his cross examination on the time when Zondi went back to church at the age of 19 years. He told her she must have anticipated that she would be sexually assaulted but went voluntarily. Zondi, who broke down from time to time saying she went back as she wanted to get closure says she was hoping that Omotoso would apologise. She says to her surprise, things got worse and Omotoso never apologised. Zondi told the court that she did not have freedom of movement whilst in Omotoso’s Durban house and was kept in a room near Omotoso’s along with two other ladies. Daubermann showed various videos in court depicting Zondi as a singer in the Grace Galaxy three girl singing group.
