The National African Farmers’ Union is calling for the nationalisation of land to replace expropriation without compensation. NAFU argues that nationalisation is one of the options that could help to resolve the land issue. NAFU President, Motsepe Matlala says land owners will not be willing to have land taken away from them without being compensated. He says the union is calling for a farming Codesa. “The current land owners are not going to fold their arms while their land is being taken without any compensation.” “We thought that nationalisation would enable the people to sit around the table and discuss and engage on the precondition to this nationalisation processes, payment would have to be engaged on,” says Matlala.
