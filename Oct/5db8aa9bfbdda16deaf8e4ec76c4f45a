Two suspects who were wanted in connection with the brutal murder of two security guards in Soweto have been shot dead by police. Police spokesperson Vish Naidoo says members of the Gauteng organised crime unit followed up information and went to a shack in Clermont west of Durban in the early hours of Tuesday morning. Naidoo says the suspects, 24-year old Lindokuhle Cebekhulu and 26-year old Mbuyiselo Mthonti, resisted arrest and were shot in the process. The two guards were shot while they were sitting in their patrol vehicle in the Moroka area of Soweto two weeks ago. Their firearms were taken from them. The incident was captured on video and went viral on social media.
