The Mangaung Metro municipality in the Free State has closed a five storey building used as a warehouse in the Bloemfontein CBD after it was found not to be complying with the City’s safety regulations. The municipality recently embarked on a drive to inspect some of the buildings for safety standards. Spokesperson for the Mangaung Metro Qondile Khedama says the municipality closed down the building two years ago after it caught fire. Khedama said, “In 2016 we came and closed the building itself but they’ve transgressed. They reopened it, you might have seen there’s evidence that there’s whole lot of evidence of stock that is in here, the stock is unhygienic, there is food, there is medication, there is a whole lot of stock that is here.” “So what we are doing as the city is making sure that this place is not used we will also be sorting legal advice as to whether to close the building or to demolish it. We just waiting for the city manager and his advisers to give an advice,” added Khedama.
