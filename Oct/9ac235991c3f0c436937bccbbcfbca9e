The four major cellphone service providers in South Africa will testify on Thursday at the Competition Commission’s market inquiry into data services and prices in Pretoria. Between them, MTN, Vodacom, Cell C and Telkom are said to have around 30 million subscribers. Vodacom CEO Shameel Joosub says for cellphone call prices to go down, the costs faced by network providers also need to drop. The aim of the inquiry is to better understand the general state of competition in the data services sector. Joosub says some of the cost challenges for the providers are the delayed switch to digital migration and regulatory uncertainty and lack of access to spectrum. On Wednesday, the commission in Pretoria heard that access to affordable internet is a human right. Media Monitoring Africa’s William Bird says access to the internet is fundamental to people’s dignity and ability to succeed in life. Bird says, “This is about the people that live in our country and not necessary those lucky enough to be here. So it must be driven by Human Rights and it must also look at providing critical skills especially for the marginalised.” “So again it is about costs, but it must also be about ensuring that people have the skills in order to engage. If we are going to succeed, every citizen needs this or we may not be here in 15 to 20 years to discuss this.”
