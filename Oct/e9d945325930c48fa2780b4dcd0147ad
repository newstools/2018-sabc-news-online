Thousands of members of the Solidarity Movement will embark on a march to the Johannesburg Stock Exchange and Sasol‘s Head Office in Sandton, Johannesburg on Thursday. The march comes in the wake of a dispute between Sasol and trade union Solidarity about the exclusion of white workers from integrated energy and chemical company Khanyisa’s plan. Solidarity will serve court papers on Sasol to test the legality of the plan. The march will start at 11 o’clock from the Mushroom Farm Park in Sandton. Solidarity’s Dirk Hermann says they will hand over a memorandum. “They will first hand over a memorandum to the JSE and the focus there will be on the JSE empowerment index and that index allows companies to list shares and schemes that is exclusive for specific race groups and that can’t be acceptable at all in today’s South Africa. The second memorandum that will be handed over is at Sasol and that memorandum will be also be accompanied by court papers and thousands of workers will hand over court papers today to Sasol as well.”
