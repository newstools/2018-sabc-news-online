Road safety improvements on the N1 will be the focal point as Limpopo host a provincial Transport Indaba in Polokwane on Thursday. Provincial government Spokesperson Phuti Seloba says roads agency Sanral engineers will be part of the Indaba whose objective is to find ways to improve N1. The stretch of road is a high traffic volume freeway connecting Polokwane and Johannesburg. It has claimed lives of dozens of motorists in recent weeks. Last week, 26 people were killed in a multiple – vehicle crash. Seloba says the engineers conduct assessments between Polokwane and Kranskop to determine possibilities of erecting concrete barriers between the N1-South lanes towards Johannesburg and the N1-North lanes towards Polokwane. “We pronounced during state of the province address that we are going to have water and transport summit including the economic summit, the Sanral engineers that are coming to do the assessments from today, because most of the accidents happens this side the northern part, but when you to the southern side the road is far open.”
