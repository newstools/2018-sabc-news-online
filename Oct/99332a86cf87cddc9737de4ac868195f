An initiative to help alleviate poverty in South Africa has been launched in Cape Town. The Rounda project which is supported by key business players is aimed at collecting small change from willing participants. The funds raised will be distributed to various charities, benefiting poverty initiatives. The idea behind the Rounda project was conceptualised about two years ago. Within that period, it has raised R1 million. The project is an initiative of Nikela Charity Funding and Development Trust. “This is about the renewal of a consensus among South Africans towards a common definition of what nation building is all about,  that’s really what we are trying to do,  we are trying to partner with government in the implementation of developmental programs that are aimed at eradicating poverty,” says Vice Chairperson of the Nikela Trust, Sipho Shezi. Key businesses have been roped in to help boost the initiative. “This project is really there to help eradicate poverty in South Africa as mentioned 12 million people sleep hungry every night those are the kind of people that we are trying to help with this project,” says Project Spokesperson Ayanda Thabethe. It is expected to run in tandem with other initiatives aimed at reducing poverty around the country.
