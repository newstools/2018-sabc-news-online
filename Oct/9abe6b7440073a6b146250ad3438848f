President Cyril Ramaphosa has spoken out on the VBS Mutual Bank scandal saying those implicated must be held accountable. Ramaphosa was speaking at an African National Congress'(ANC) Musa Dladla Regional Fundraising dinner at Empangeni on the northern KwaZulu-Natal coast. Dubbed the great bank heist, President Ramaphosa said the VBS matter was most concerning and processes to deal with those responsible must be sped up. Two senior Limpopo ANC officials – Treasurer Danny Msiza and deputy chairperson and Vhembe district executive mayor – Florence Radzilani are deeply implicated. He says: “We should be able to deal with corruption in a most effective manner and to ensure that those who get involved in the acts of corruption must be held accountable for their deeds. There needs to be consequence management and that the consequences are going to be quite harsh against them.” “Now the VBS saga is a most concerning one. We need to speed up the process of ensuring those who have done wrong against our people should be made to account without delay. It hurts our people when they see people who are involved in all these corrupt activities just carrying on with their lives as if nothing has happened,” adds Ramaphosa. Meanwhile, ANC National Chairperson Gwede Mantashe, says a commission may be appointed to investigate the VBS collapse and looting saga. Mantashe, addressing an ANC event in Polokwane has called for all those implicated to own to their mistakes through a commission. He says: “I suspect a VBS commission is coming because if we think that we can hide we are committing a mistake. We can’t hide, we must own up because if we can’t own up it means we can’t be trusted with any other thing. People must own up and stand up and say this is what happened.” Related Video
