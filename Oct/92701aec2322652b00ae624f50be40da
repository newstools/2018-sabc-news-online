The African National Congress (ANC) in KwaZulu-Natal says the party has recorded a significant victory in the recent by-election in eThekwini. The party won ward 71 – a ward that was previously controlled by the Democratic Alliance (DA). A small but a sweet victory for the ANC, the party has won the ward which was held by the DA for ten years. The ward comprises of areas such as Shallcross and Crossmoore – areas formerly known to be Indian areas, as well as the informal settlement of Bottlebrush. The community has recently protested against an increase in crime, the mushrooming of shacks and incidents of land grabs in the area. The party says this victory proves that it can unite people from all races. ANC Ethekwini Regional Secretary Bheki Ntuli says:”The party now believes that it can get support, even in areas that were considered to have a strong DA support.” He adds that this goes to show that the ANC stands for non-racialism. The ANC received over 2700 votes while the DA received more than four hundred fewer. Meanwhile, provincial leaders of the ANC say they have requested an urgent meeting with the IEC to address allegations of voter irregularities in some areas of the province.
