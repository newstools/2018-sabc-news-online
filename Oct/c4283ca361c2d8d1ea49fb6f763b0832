The Congress of the People (COPE) says it’s against the proposal by ANC Chairperson Gwede Mantashe that a Commission of Inquiry be appointed into the VBS saga. Mantashe, says a commission may be appointed to investigate the VBS collapse and looting saga. Mantashe was addressing an ANC event in Polokwane. He called for all those implicated to own up to their mistakes through a commission. COPE’s Dennis Bloem says there’s overwhelming evidence and those implicated must just face the full might of the law. Bloem says: “We are saying this is an insult to the poor people who have lost their money. COPE is saying there’s no need for such a commission. The Hawks must just arrest the people that are fingered in the report.” Meanwhile, VBS bank is in the process of retrenching 100 employees. Spokesperson for the curator’s office, Louise Brugman says: “After having concluded talks with the employees, the curator can confirm that final employment contracts have been signed with 25 employees and the retrenchment packages have been issued to 100 staff members. The implication of the retrenchment is that retrenched staff members will receive a retrenchment package comprised of notice pay, severance pay and accumulative leave.” Related Video
