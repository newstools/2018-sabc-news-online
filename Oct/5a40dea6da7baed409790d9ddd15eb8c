It has been quiet overnight at Witsand in Atlantis on the Cape West Coast, following Thursdays’s violent service delivery protest. Municipal workers have started clearing the road of debris but certain roads remain closed due to tree stumps which have not been removed. The community is demanding better service delivery but have called off the protest because they say an agreement has been reached about the promised construction of a community hall. However, Community leader, Thobile Maseti says the residents are planning to go to the police station on Friday to demand the release of seven protestors. He says: “The community is saying we can call the protest off but one of the things that is worrying the community now which is a recent development, its the people that were arrested. The community believes that those people did not do anything wrong.”
