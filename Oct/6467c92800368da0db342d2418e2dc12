The trial of pastor, Timothy Omotoso, will resume in the High Court in Port Elizabeth on Monday morning. The state indicated that it would call the second witness. The first witness 22-year-old Cheryl Zondi testified last week. Omotoso allegedly groomed and raped her since she was 14-years-old. Omotoso and two co-accused, Zukiswa Sitho and Lusanda Sulani, are facing 97 charges which include sexual assault, racketeering and human trafficking involving young girls and women from the Jesus Dominion International Church. Cheryl Zondi was the first witness to take the stand last week. She endured gruelling cross examination from defence lawyer Peter Daubermann. She was allegedly sexually groomed and raped by Omotoso, at age of 14 years.Â  She is not off the hook yet, as she will be recalled for further cross examination, after she has completed her second year business management exams in Johannesburg. Court will in the meantime continue with the second witness. Protests are expected outside court and Minister in the Presidency for Women, Bathabile Dlamini will have a media briefing outside court.
