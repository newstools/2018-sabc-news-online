The man accused of the murder of a Phoenix family will on Thursday be back in the Verulam Magistrate’s Court north of Durban. Colin Pillay is accused of the murder of Janelle Govindsamy and her daughters Denisha and Rackelle in September. The State has told the court that it intends to oppose bail. At his last appearance, the State added a charge of robbery with aggravating circumstances to Pillay’s three murder charges. The postponement was requested for his attorney Chris Gounden to consult with him on the most recent charge. It is alleged that Pillay killed Janelle and her daughters in their Phoenix flat, one by one during the course of one afternoon. Their bodies were discovered by Janelle Govindsamy’s husband, Sagren.
