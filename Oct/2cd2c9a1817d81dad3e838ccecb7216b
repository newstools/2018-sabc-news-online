The African National Congress (ANC) in Limpopo will hold a special sitting this weekend to decide on the fate of some of its members implicated in the VBS Mutual Bank saga. The party’s Limpopo deputy chairperson Florence Radzilani and Treasurer Danny Msiza have also been implicated in the VBS saga. Provincial party spokesperson Donald Selamolela said, “We will start processing the report this afternoon, where our officials will interpret it and apply their minds on it, have collective wisdom. On Sunday we might hold a special PEC where will have a collective application of our wisdom over the matter.” Meanwhile, Brian Shivambu, the younger brother of the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) deputy president Floyd Shivambu, says it is not fair for the Reserve Bank report to implicate him in looting VBS Mutual Bank without interviewing him. Shivambu plans to sue the Reserve Bank for defamation of character and has denied any involvement in the looting of VBS. He says his company Sgameka Projects was appointed to provide professional consulting services to Vele Investments in their mining and insurance businesses and claims that his company does not have any working relationship with VBS and did not receive any payment from it. However, he admitted that during the contracting period, Vele Investments advised him to use VBS for easy payments.
