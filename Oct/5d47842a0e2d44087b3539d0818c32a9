The White River Magistrate’s Court in Mpumalanga has heard how two alleged rhino poaching kingpins, Joe Nyalunga and Sydney Mabuza were tracked down through an underground operation by the Hawks. The two alleged syndicate leaders have been arrested along with four police officers stationed at Skukuza police station in the Kruger National Park. Hawks investigating officer Leroy Pieter Brewser has testified that police followed the suspects on their way from the Park to Mabuza’s property. On the property, the police found a red cooler box filled with six rhino horns. According to Captain Leroy Pieter Bruwser the underground operation kicked off immediately when one of the kingpins Sydney Mabuza was involved in an accident on the N4 toll route in January 2017. Bruwser says the police on the scene saw a man who arrived to pack Mabuza’s belonging taking off with two bags and one bag was filled with money. He says many people linked to this syndicate are yet to be arrested. The bail application has been postponed to Monday.
