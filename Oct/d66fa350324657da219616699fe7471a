Several civic organisations and political parties in the Nelson Mandela Bay Metro have vowed to shut down the Jesus Dominion International Church. They will hold a mass protest in Port Elizabeth on Sunday. This follows the gruelling cross-examination that the first victim of Nigerian pastor Timothy Omotoso endured in the High Court in Port Elizabeth this week. Cheryl Zondi was allegedly sexually groomed and raped since the age of 14. Several other girls, whom Omotoso allegedly abused, will testify about their ordeals in the church mission house in Durban. The African National Congress Women’s League is among those fighting to have the church closed. The league’s Nomafa Sinetile says, “We still firmly united against rapists, human traffickers and the manipulation of our girl children and our sisters. We say enough is enough, the church must be closed down.” Meanwhile, Zondi has written a public letter in which she expresses her gratitude for all the support she is getting. The witness, who has been under intense cross-examination by defence lawyer Peter Daubermann, forwarded the letter to the SABC . Several organisations and the public supported her in court. On social media people applauded her for being brave and fearless in the way she dealt with the questions.
