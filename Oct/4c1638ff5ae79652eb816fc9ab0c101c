President Cyril Ramaphosa has given suspended SARS commissioner, Tom Moyane until next week Friday to explain why he should not be fired. Retired Judge Robert Nugent in his report into tax administration at SARS has recommended that Moyane be fired in order to set the tax collector on a firm path of recovery. Presidential spokesperson, Khusela Diko says as far as the President is concerned Judge Nugent report is final. The President is studying the report as it currently stands and he has written to Moyane through his legal representatives and has asked for reasons why he should not implement the recommendation that have been made by Judge Nugent. He is applying his mind and has given Moyane up until October 26th to come back with those particular submissions. “Mr Moyane did not participate in the Nugent Commission, we’ve seen some media reports where they claim they not even aware or perhaps not even recognising the reports.”  Mark Kingon to testify Meanwhile acting SARS commissioner Mark Kingon will testify at the SARS inquiry sitting in Pretoria on Friday. The SARS inquiry is probing financial misconduct at SARS during Moyane’s term of leadership at the revenue service. Responding to question from journalists on whether Nugent had overstepped his mark in the calling for Moyane’s axing, Nugent said that his recommendation was not a call on a “disciplinary matter”, but was one of “management”. This after suspended SARS commissioner Tom Moyane’s lawyer Eric Mabuza stated that Nugent was acting outside the terms of his reference. Mabuza said that Nugent had stepped on advocate Azhar Bham’s terrain, who is chairing Moyane’s disciplinary hearing. The commission is expected to submit its final report to the president in December.
