The net is closing in on the killers of an African National Congress (ANC) councillor. That’s according to Police Minister Bheki Cele who addressed mourners at his funeral. Sibusiso Maphumulo was murdered in Umlazi, south of Durban last week. He was gunned down by unknown attackers outside his home. The killing of political figures in KwaZulu-Natal is once again making headlines. It’s estimated that at least 40 councillors have been killed in the province in the past five years. Thirty two-year-old Sibusiso Maphumulo was elected as a Ward Councillor in 2016. His family and local residents say he was a pillar of the community. They want justice meted out. Siya Maphumulo his brother says, “I pray that the investigating officer will be protected and be able to do his work and find those who killed my brother.” The Police Minister revealed that the Investigating officer in the case had received various threats. Maphumulo’s murder is believed to be a well-planned hit. “The murder of Maphumulo was planned, and that CCTV cameras that would have recorded the murder were deliberately tampered with,” says Cele. The new task team investigating political killings was set up in July and already they have made dozens of arrests. Government however remains concerned about the safety of Councillors. Cele also announced that a new cold case squad has also been established to investigate old political cases that have gone cold.
