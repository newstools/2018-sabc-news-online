The KwaZulu-Natal Department of Cooperative Governance has placed disaster management teams on standby following a warning by the South African Weather Service about possible severe thunderstorms and hail in the western parts of the province. Cooperative Governance MEC Nomusa Dube-Ncube said the teams are monitoring the situation, especially in low lying areas following a warning about possible localised flooding. Motorists have also been asked to be extra careful because of slippery roads and when crossing bridges. Residents in low lying areas have also been asked to seek shelter on higher ground. Weather forecaster Stacey Colborne says there is a 60 percent chance of rain in the afternoon over most of the province. Colborne, “Our severe weather warning is mainly for the Western part of KZN, which include Underberg, Kokstad, Mooi River, Ladysmith, Newcastle, Vryheid and the Dundee area.  With regards to the thunderstorms, you can expect strong winds, possible hail, as well as heavy downpours which may lead to localised flooding. We’re expecting it from about 2 o’clock in the afternoon up until about 5, 6 o’clock in the evening.”
