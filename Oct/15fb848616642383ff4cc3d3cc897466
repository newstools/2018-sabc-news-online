The Congress of South African Trade Unions in Gauteng has announced that it will march on Friday against e-tolls. The Labour Federation expressed dismay by Finance Minister Tito Mboweni’s call in his maiden mid-term budget speech for motorists to pay for Etolls. Speaking during a media briefing in Johannesburg on Sunday, Cosatu’s Gauteng Secretary, Dumisani Dakile insists that e-tolls do not serve the people of the province. “Cosatu is angry with the new Finance Minister’s announcement in the mid-term budget speech that government will continue the current system of e-tolls, which represents daylight robbery to the people of Gauteng. We think the minister has already been captured by the dominant new-liberal ideology within the department of finance. We hoped the minister will bring in some fresh air and articulate progressive developments, however he has decided to side with the rich at the expense of the poor and working class in the country. We have filed Section 77 for a stay away on the 2nd of November (Friday) for a march to deliver a memorandum to the president in Tshwane.” Watch related video:
