Political analyst, Dirk Kotze, says he does not believe that tensions between Cape Town Mayor, Patricia de Lille and the Democratic Alliance will have a significant national impact on the party. This after it emerged that De Lille may be criminally charged for corruption alleged in forensic reports commissioned by the DA. The party reached an agreement with her two months ago for her to resign as Mayor next week, but De Lille says she will first consult with her lawyers. Five DA members on the Cape Town council resigned this week in solidarity with De Lille. De Lille claims that the DA is damaging its own brand with what she calls a “continuing smear campaign against her”. Kotze, however, disagrees. “I think it is a matter for Cape Town itself, it is at a municipal level and not provincial level. Cape Town was the first city that was won by the DA and the fact that [Helen] Zille was there, gave them a lot of prominence and they use it very much in their election campaigns in support of their argument that they should become the next government.” “But at the same time in other provinces it’s not really a matter that affects them. What led to this situation is located within the Western Cape and it’s not necessarily national issues that affect what happens in other provinces.” Related video click below:
