Gauteng police have launched a manhunt for a group of suspects who shot and wounded four taxi owners. The taxi owners were shot in Savannah City near De Deur south of Johannesburg on Wednesday. It’s understood that the taxi owners were seriously wounded after a group of suspects opened fire at them while they were standing at the local taxi rank. Police spokesperson Kay Makhubele says: “So far we have not arrested anyone and the motive of the incident is still unknown.” He says police are investigating a case of attempted murder and robbery as one of the taxi owners was robbed as well as some passengers.
