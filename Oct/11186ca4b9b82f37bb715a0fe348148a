Striking MyCiti bus transport workers in Cape Town are pinning their hopes on Wednesday’s meeting with the labour union, Numsa to help pressurise their employers and the city to give in to their demands of improved working conditions and safety on buses. The union’s Western Cape Secretary, Vuyo Letswelo is expected to meet the striking group to discuss the way forward. The workers, including drivers and cleaners, embarked on mass action on Monday which resulted in the suspension of the MyCiti bus service in the city. A spokesperson for the workers, Patrick Mabindisa says they are determined to persevere with their industrial action despite not being paid for taking part in an unprotected strike. The workers, supported by the EFF, have been demonstrating outside the Civic Centre asking the City of Cape Town to intervene. Companies employing them are currently contracted by the City to operate MyCiti bus services. They want to be in-sourced, among other demands.
