Former North West premier and African National Congress (ANC) provincial chairperson, Supra Mahumapelo, has withdrawn from the party’s Provincial Task Team (PTT). This has emerged after a meeting of the PTT over the weekend that was snubbed by two major ANC regions, the Dr Kenneth Kaunda and Dr Ruth Segomotsi Mompati regions. The PTT was established at the end of August to administer the affairs of the party in the province. This was after the provincial executive committee was disbanded. Coordinator for the PTT, Keneetswe Mosenogi says they’ve accepted Mahumapelo’s withdrawal “It’s true that he has declined to serve in the provincial task team and which I think he can rightfully do so. As a member he can decide to accept or decline the responsibility but it’s our responsibility and that of the national executive committee to engage further and understand. But I think in his resignation also he did indicate that he will continue with his activism in the organisation, so we would respect that,” says Mosenogi. Watch related video below
