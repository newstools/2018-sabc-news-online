The Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (Outa) says Finance Minister, Nhlanhla Nene will have his first opportunity on Wednesday to publicly provide his understanding of activities that took place during his axing in 2015. Nene is expected to testify during the State Capture Inquiry in Parktown, Johannesburg about a meeting with the Guptas. The EFF has claimed that Nene was given the position of Finance Minister by the Guptas and they called for his axing when he would no longer cooperate. Markets then reacted aggressively, sending the rand into free fall when Former President Jacob Zuma fired Nene and replaced him with the little known Des Van Rooyen. Outa’s Rudi Heyneke says it’s important to know that it is the first opportunity to test previous evidence. “We heard former Deputy Minister Jonas testifying that shortly after his visit to Saxonwold, he contacted Nene and he told him about this. So today is the opportunity to confirm or deny that testimony. It will also be interesting to hear what happened in 2015 when Nene was axed, and what was the lead up to that and hopefully we will get answers.” For more watch below:
