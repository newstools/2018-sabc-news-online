The case against nine men including two police officers from Sophiatown police station arrested in connection with the murder of 21-year-old Bradley Saul from Westbury, west of Johannesburg, will resume at the city’s Magistrates Court, on Thursday. The case was postponed last week for a formal bail application. Complaints about police formed part of protests in Westbury earlier this month. The suspects were arrested in a crime intelligence driven operation. The four others also appeared in the Johannesburg Magistrates Court on charges of possession of drugs. The two police officers, Warrant Officer Wynand Steyn and Sergent Tom keet are alleged to have concealed crucial evidence when they arrived on the scene of Sauls’s murder. For years, the residents of Westbury have been calling for the two cops to be removed from the Sophiatown police station. Their arrests brought to nine the number of people arrested in connection with Saul’s death.
