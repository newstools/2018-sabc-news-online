The African National Congress (ANC) Chief Whip in Parliament Jackson Mthembu has confirmed former Finance Minister, Nhlanhla Nene‘s, resignation as Member of Parliament. Nene’s resignation follows his decision to step down as Finance Minister over the Gupta saga. At the State Capture Commission earlier in October, Nene admitted that he had met the Guptas on a number of occasions at their Saxonwold home during the tenure of then President Jacob Zuma. Nene had previously denied holding any such meetings with the Guptas. President Cyril Ramaphosa accepted his resignation and announced Tito Mboweni as his replacement. ANC Chief Whip Mthembu has thanked Nene for his service to the party, saying not many people would own up to an error of judgment. Nene submitted his resignation as Member Parliament on Friday morning. This is Nene’s second resignation as MP, following his sacking as Finance Minister by former President Jacob Zuma in 2016.
