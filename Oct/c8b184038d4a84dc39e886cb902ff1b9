Two police officers have been arrested in connection with the death of a Tshwane University of Technology (TUT) student during a recent protest which led to the closure of the Soshanguve campus north of Pretoria. The arrest on Katlego Monareng’s death was announced by the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (IPID). Monareng was shot dead during a protest over SRC elections. It is alleged that police fired warning shots with R5 rifles. IPID spokesperson Moses Dlamini says IPID has concluded its investigation with only two technical reports outstanding. The suspects will appear in the Soshanguve Magistrate’s Court on Tuesday on a charge of murder. RELATED VIDEO CLICK BELOW:
