The ANC in the Northern Cape says it does not accept the newly-elected Executive Mayor of the Sol Plaatje Municipality. This comes after a new mayor was finally elected during a special council meeting. Sixty-four councillors voted during a secret ballot. Councillor Pule Thabane won with 33 votes against the 30 of his counterpart, Patrick Mabilo. The party condemns the appointment, saying the mayor colluded with opposition parties in achieving the result. ”Our view, as the ANC in the Northern Cape, is that we are seriously disgusted and very disappointed about what happened in that council. The people of Sol Plaatje voted the ANC with a overwhelming majority to be in charge of that municipality. So to have a group of ANC councillors, who colluded with the opposition to get one of them to be elected as the Mayor of Sol Plaatje, that’s gutter politics,” says ANC Northern Cape Chairperson, Zamani Saul.
