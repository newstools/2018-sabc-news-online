The family of Rivonia trialist Andrew Mlangeni has confirmed that he’s been hospitalised in a Cape Town hospital. Family spokesperson, Sello Mlangeni, says the condition of the 93-year-old struggle veteran is critical but stable. Mlangeni has been in and out of hospital for the past two weeks due to ill health. He is one of two survivors of the Rivonia treason trials in the 1960s, the other being Dennis Goldberg. A Struggle icon revered around the world, Mlangeni joined the African National Congress Youth League (ANCYL) in 1951. He was incarcerated on Robben Island with the late former President Nelson Mandela, Walter Sisulu, Govan Mbeki and others. The Rivonia trialist had survived the gallows after the sentences were converted to life. Post 1994 and after his release from prison he continued to serve the organisation he loved dearly. But he was later disappointed by its former President Jacob Zuma. Mlangeni’s legacy lives on, on the international front.
