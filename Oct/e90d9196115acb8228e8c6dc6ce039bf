Community members attending the trial of Pastor Timothy Omotoso have spoken out about Wednesday’s explosive evidence in the High Court in Port Elizabeth. The alleged victims of Omotoso are receiving support from the community of Port Elizabeth. The first of the victims Sharon Zondi told the court about her traumatic experience and her sexual assault allegedly at the hands of Omotoso. The pastor, together with two accused, face a total of 97 charges. The charges range from trafficking for sexual purposes, to racketeering, rape and sexual assault. One community member says, “I believe the girls are not lying. They cannot lie about this. It is very important and they know it has the worlds interest. So, they cannot lie. Omotoso must go to jail and stay there. He deserves it.” Meanwhile, members of the Jesus Dominion International church are still adamant that Omotoso is being falsely accused. Spokesperson of the church Osuagwu Chukx told the media that they found it unfair that Omotoso was being kept behind bars.
