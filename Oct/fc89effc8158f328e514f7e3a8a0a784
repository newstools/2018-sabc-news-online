Former Free State ANC treasurer Mxolisi Dukwana says his latest revelations on the party’s Secretary-General Ace Magashule are just a tip of the iceberg. Dukwana served in the Free State executive council between 1994 and 2012. He insists that the provincial government was interacting with the politically-connected Gupta family during Magashule’s tenure as the premier. He has revealed that he will appear before the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture to bring to the fore details of what he terms the clandestine meetings members the provincial government had with the Guptas. Dukwana says it was Rajesh Gupta who offered to give him R2 million to facilitate a multi-million rand project in the province. “He had actually agreed with Ace that the project is mine alone, Ace will not be involved because they had other things they were doing on their side. So, this project would belong to me and him alone. They said upon signing this thing, I will get R2 million.”
