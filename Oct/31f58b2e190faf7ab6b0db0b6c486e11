Some 34 migrants have died in a shipwreck in the western Mediterranean, which 26 people survived, the UN migration agency said on Tuesday, citing the Moroccan navy and a Spanish aid agency. Joel Millman, spokesperson of the International Organization for Migration (IOM), tells Reuters: “The boat was adrift since Sunday with 60 people aboard. At least 34 have drowned, it looks like there were 26 survivors.” The information came from the Moroccan navy and a Spanish non-governmental oragnisation Caminando Fronteras, he says.
