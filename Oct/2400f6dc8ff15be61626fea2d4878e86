The African National Congress (ANC) in KwaZulu-Natal has formed a new Task Team in the Moses Mabhida region. The task team will prepare for the regional conference that will be held after 2019’s general elections. It will also coordinate the party’s election campaign in the region. KwaZulu-Natal ANC Provincial Secretary Mdumiseni Ntuli says they are awaiting a court ruling on the conference for the Harry Gwala region. This after some aggrieved members in the region took the party to court in September challenging provincial leadership’s decision to allow the regional conference to proceed. Ntuli says, “On the Harry Gwala court case, the PEC is of the view that the matter will have to be settled in a court of law because we are quite convinced that there was nothing wrong that we did. We believe that substantive work was done before the conference convened.” All ANC regions which are yet to hold their conferences in 2018 will only have them in 2019 after general elections. This follows a decision by the ANC NEC that the focus will now be on elections.
