President Cyril Ramaphosa has taken the first step in the process of appointing a new Director of Public Prosecutions, in time for the 90 days deadline set by the Constitutional Court in August. He has invited legal organisations and independent public institutions to assist in identifying and selecting individuals for consideration for the position of National Director of Public Prosecutions (NDPP). Energy Minister Jeff Radebe will chair the panel which will be identifying and selecting three potential candidates for the position. In August, the Constitutional Court ruled that the appointment of Shaun Abrahams as the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) head was illegal and subsequently said former head Mxolisi Nxasanaâ€˜s pay-out after he was fired by former president Jacob Zuma was also unconstitutional. The President says the process will take place in consultation with Justice and Constitutional Development Minister Michael Masutha. South Africa is getting closer to having a new Director of Public Prosecutions. While the panel will make recommendations to President Ramaphosa, the Constitution prescribes that it is ultimately only the President who can decide who to appoint as NDPP. Among those organisations that have been tasked with making recommendations are the Law Society of South Africa, Auditor-General Kimi Makwetu and the South African Human rights Commission (SAHRC).
