Minister for Women in the Presidency, Bathabile Dlamini says her team will approach the Society of Advocates to address the conduct of defense lawyer Peter Daubermann in the rape trial of controversial Nigerian Pastor Timothy Omotoso. Dlamini says Daubermann’s cross-examination of state witness Cheryl Zondi caused secondary trauma to the alleged victim. The trial will resume on Thursday in the Port Elizabeth High Court. Speaking to the media after attending Omotoso’s trial on Monday, Dlamini said her department will also review laws relating to sexual crimes. She says her department will be revisiting the sexual offences act, the domestic violence act and the criminal procedures act with the view to strengthen laws to protect women. She says: “Cross-examination should not be a platform used by legal practitioners to enforce secondary trauma on witnesses. We believe the advocates conduct was an overreach and we will be consulting the Bar Council of Advocates to address this.”
