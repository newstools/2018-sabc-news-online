At least 13 people have been killed in a suicide attack on an Afghan election campaign rally. Legislative elections in Afghanistan are scheduled for later this month. The attack is the first suicide assault since campaigning officially kicked off last Friday for the parliamentary elections. More than 30 people were wounded when the assailant blew himself up among supporters of candidate Abdul Nasir Mohmmand. Some of the wounded are in a critical condition.
