Four murder cases involving residents from Westbury were all heard in the Johannesburg Magistrate’s Court on Tuesday. Nine suspects, among them two police officers from the Sophiatown Police Station, appeared for the murder of 21-year-old resident Bradley Sauls, while three others implicated in the death of 48-year-old Heather Peterson also made a brief appearance. It was yet another brief appearance, amid strict security for the suspects of the Bradley Sauls murder trial. Only a handful of relatives, journalists and community members were allowed in court. Sauls family were among those following proceedings. Twenty one-year-old Bradley Sauls was gunned down in Westbury on the 24 July in an alleged revenge attack.  Among the suspects are two officers from the Sophiatown Police Station. They face kidnapping and murder charges. Warrant Officer Wynand Steyn and Seargent Tom Keet are accused of tampering with evidence at the crime scene and concealing crucial evidence in the murder. In another matter, an alleged gang leader Keenan Ebrahims also appeared on a second murder case at the same court. The family of slain mother Heather Peterson was also in court.  Peterson was killed in a gang crossfire nearly four weeks ago. Her death sparked violent protests in the area.  The case against three suspects accused of her death was also postponed. All the cases have been postponed to next month.
