Gauteng Premier David Makhura says e-tolls have not worked and the African National Congress (ANC) in the province does not support them. He says there is a need to work out how to pay for the improved road infrastructure, but this will not be through the e-tolling system. This comes after Finance Minister Tito Mboweni, speaking in Parliament on Wednesday, urged motorists to pay for e-tolls, saying nothing is for free. Makhura, who is also the Gauteng ANC Chairperson, insists that e-tolls are not part of the future plans of Gauteng. The 13th Gauteng ANC Conference resolved that the e-tolls scheme should be done away within the province and mandated Makhura to engage President Cyril Ramaphosa and National Government to expedite the resolution of the e-tolls. “We do, however, acknowledge the sovereign debt needs to be settled. We are working on a proposal that we will take to national government which includes the comprehensive recommendation on; 1- What to do with the infrastructure that’s currently in place with regards to the Gantries; 2- Methods and ways of how to pay off the sovereign debt; and 3- How to go forward in funding freeway improvement projects across the province,” says Gauteng ANC Spokesperson Tasneem Motara.
