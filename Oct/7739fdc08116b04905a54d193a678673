Late Environmental Affairs Minister Edna Molewa‘s kindness has touched many lives while she was North West Premier. One of those who benefited from her compassion is SABC radio journalist Bobby Serame. He is still grateful for Molewa’s intervention, while he was admitted at Mahikeng Provincial Hospital following a car crash in 2010. “I remember Mma Edna Molewa when she was still the North West Premier. She visited me at Bophelong Hospital after I got involved in an accident. For about two days, I lay there without any doctor attending to me. People were surprised to see her at my bedside with her bodyguards and after she left several doctors came in immediately and attended to me and sent me to theatre where I was operated on. Imagine if she had not come. I would have died right there. She showed her motherly love, not only for me but to all the people. Imagine a Premier setting her time aside for me. Her presence saved my life. May her soul rest in peace.” Molewa has been described as a selfless leader who put people first. The ANC in the Northern Cape held a memorial service for Molewa, remembering the work she did for the party. Molewa passed away almost two weeks ago following a short illness. Northern Cape ANC Provincial Secretary Deshi Ngxanga says Molewa will be remembered for her dedication to the movement. “She led this movement; she grew in this movement – a selfless leader, well balanced and educated; somebody who was very articulate. She served in the disciplinary committee of the ANC. She was a true disciplinarian. When you stray away, she would pull you by the ear and say this is wrong. So, we have lost indeed as the organization.”
