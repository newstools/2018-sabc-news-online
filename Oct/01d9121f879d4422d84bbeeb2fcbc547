The Democratic Alliance (DA) has reiterated its calls to President Cyril Ramaphosa to reduce his bloated Cabinet from 35 ministers to 15 portfolios. The opposition party held its 3-day Federal Council meeting which ended in Johannesburg on Sunday. State owned entities also came under scrutiny, with new appeals for the national carrier to be privatised. The official opposition has rubbished the proposal by some within the African National Congress to nationalise the banks. DA federal council says the policy of land expropriation without compensation will be disastrous for the economy “Expropriation of land without compensation, the DA believes it should be abolished because that is going to unsettle investment. Some of the things the DA came up with is to make sure we remove the monopolisation of Eskom and believe in the independent power supply so that municipalities can create more competition and have sources developing energy for SA, “says DA national spokesperson Refiloe Ntse’khe. The DA added  its calls for Economic Freedom Fighters  Deputy President Floyd Shivambu to be hauled before the Parliament Ethics Committee, after the Motau report implicating his little brother in the so-called “Great Bank Heist” in the VBS Mutual Bank saga. “We cannot protect somebody just because we happen to be in a coalition agreement with them. The one thing the DA has prided itself with is we live by the rule of law. If indeed Shivambu is affected in the VBS, it shouldn’t affect the coalition.” Meanwhile, the DA says it is all systems go for the 2019 elections.  “If an election is announced anytime our machinery will be able to cope with being ready for the election. We have been going out through the rest of the country delivering a message of one South Africa for all,” says the party’s second national spokesperson Solly Malatsi. The influx of illegal immigrants in the country is another concern to the opposition party. Click below for more on the story:
