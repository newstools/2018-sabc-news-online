The Economic Freedom Fighters(EFF) has challenged government to make the financial guarantee letter available to the SABC to get funding to bring stability. EFF Spokesperson and member of Parliament’s Communication Committee Mbuyiseni Ndlozi says the official letter from Treasury has not yet been given to the Public Broadcaster. He says the EFF rejects retrenchments as the mechanism used to cut costs. He says: “The government of Ramaphosa must give SABC through Treasury a letter of financial guarantee so that they can borrow money from banks and get stability. If they get such a letter there is no bank that will not lend them money. “We have expressed a deep worry and rejection that you can’t as a point of departure go for the workers in stabilising the SABC when you cut thousands and thousands of workers. The first point of departure should be to get that guarantee which would give the SABC the opportunity to get money and stabilise itself.” “It shouldn’t be laying down workers,” adds Ndlozi.
