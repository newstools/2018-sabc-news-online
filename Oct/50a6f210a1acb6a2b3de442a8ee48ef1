The mass funeral service for 21 people who died during a multi-vehicle crash on the N1 outside Polokwane last week will be held at Senwabarwana in Limpopo on Saturday morning. The 21 were among 26 people killed in the pile-up that occurred when a truck had a tyre burst and collided with a taxi, two bakkies and a car eight days ago. Limpopo Department of Transport spokesperson Matome Moremi Taueatsoala says two others of the deceased were laid to rest yesterday, while three other families opted for separate funerals. “The task team is hard at work making sure that all the final touch ups are up to scratch. We will be saying our final goodbyes … two people were buried in Polokwane yesterday. We have got the driver of the truck and the driver of the combi, as well as one of the passengers the families have decided to have separate funeral arrangements of their own,” adds Moremi Taueatsoala.
