Civil Society Organisation #UniteBehind is calling on Transport Minister Blade Nzimande and the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa) Board to institute a thorough investigation into what it calls the deliberate sabotage of trains in the Western Cape. #Unite Behind Organiser Zukiswa Vuka says there is a pattern that can be seen in the burning of trains between 2015, after the release of the Public Protector’s Derailed Report and the Current Prasa Board’s fight against corruption. Vuka says Prasa needs to start working with the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) and the Hawks to arrest the perpetrators. She says the increase in the burning of trains is not a normal crime. She says her organisation suspects that it relates to the issue around tender irregularities that were discovered. “In 2015, when that derailed report came out we started seeing the burning of trains. The number of trains which have been burned was getting high, and at that time Lucky Montana who is also implicated in the dodgy tenders resigned. Then soon after that there were trains that were burnt. So we are seeing the same patterns even now. Now that there are people who are being cleaned out, people who are being sacked we seeing a fightback. So it’s a sequence, it’s something that has happened before and we are seeing it right now,” explains Vuka.
