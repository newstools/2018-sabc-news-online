Police Minister Bheki Cele has announced the establishment of a permanent anti-gang unit in Cape Town. The unit will consist of 95 members. Cele addressed the local community of Hanover Park after Gift of the Givers volunteer, 20 year- old Ameerodien Noordien was killed in a gang related shooting on Friday. Last week the Minister also deployed a Tactical Response Team in Westbury, Johannesburg, to help fight the scourge of drugs and gang-related violence. Cele says the Cape Town unit will be deployed from the beginning of next month. He says: “We are putting most of these units together but we will put extra investigation capabilities and try to find the most experienced detectives. We will try to work together with the prosecution so by the time we take the case to court, the case is tight.”
