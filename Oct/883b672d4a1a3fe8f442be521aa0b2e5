The Nigerian community in Nelson Mandela Bay has pleaded with the public not to paint them with the same brush as the televangelist Nigerian Pastor, Timothy Omotoso, who is currently on trial the Port Elizabeth High Court. Foreign nationals living in the friendly city have condemned Omotoso’s alleged offences but have called on the South African Judiciary to conduct a fair and unbiased trial. The rape trial will resume in the Port Elizabeth High Court on Thursday. The case was postponed to give the defence time to prepare its argument for an appeal. This after the presiding judge, Mandela Makaula refused to recuse himself from the case, following the defence’s request. Omotoso and his co-accused are facing 97 sex-related charges. WATCH BELOW:
