Artisanal miners in Kimberley have made a grim discovery of skeletal remains in shallow graves just outside the city.  This is the second discovery in as many weeks. A week ago, they discovered bones in Kimberley’s West End suburb about a week ago. This time around, the two shallow graves were discovered in mine tailings near the Kimberley industrial area. Police say the bones will be sent for forensic verification. The artisanal miners say they believe the bones are human remains. A Kimberley artisanal mineworkers Lucky Seekoei says, “We are asking ourselves questions as to whether these people were miners or were those comrades who were actually killed during the apartheid era.” Investigations are continuing.
