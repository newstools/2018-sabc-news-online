Two national ministers have spoken out about sexual offences against women and children. Transport Minister Blade Nzimande and Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga were speaking at the funeral of Eastern Cape Education MEC Mandla Makupula in East London. They referred to Nigerian Pastor Timothy Omotoso and two co-accused who are appearing in the High Court in Port Elizabeth on 97 sexual-related charges. The first witness, 22-year-old Cheryl Zondi, was allegedly groomed and raped by Omotoso since she was 14 years old. “Violence against children is something that all of us, women and men, must face together, as part of rebuilding our community. Any grooming of a young child is a criminal offence. Empower the girl child to make sure that they are not victims of the patriarchy and its cruel tendencies. And I know he was going to lead the discussions,” says Nzimande. He also called on clergy men to stand up and act against what he called fake churches in the country.
