The South African Council of Churches(SACC) in Limpopo has denounced the looting of billions of rands at VBS as immoral and evil. The council wants the bank to be saved and the employees of the troubled mutual bank to retain their jobs. Reverend Mukondi Ramulondi from the SACC has also announced a series of prayer services at the VBS Sibasa branch and affected municipalities. He says: “We think it is too early for anyone to support the closure of the bank when we know based on what has been released that there are people who are alleged to have committed such bad behaviour. So it is our view that the money must be recovered and no single person in South Africa must lose their jobs just because some people came together and decided some people should lose jobs.” Meanwhile, a meeting between 100 retrenched VBS employees, officials from the office of the curator and senior Human Resources managers is underway at the Thohoyandou main branch of the embattled mutual bank. The workers were given retrenchment notices last week but they have not yet signed them. The workers are not happy with severance packages they are going to receive. Only 83 will get the 13th cheque. The workers will also get a week’s salary for each year spent with VBS. They are blaming VBS management of punishing them for the actions of those who who allegedly looted the bank. The workers’ last day at VBS will be November 12.  Additional Reporting by Rudzani Tshivhase
