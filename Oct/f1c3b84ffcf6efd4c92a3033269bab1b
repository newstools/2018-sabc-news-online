The City of Cape Town says it will deliver starter kits to victims of the fire in Khayelitsha on the Cape Flats on Sunday morning. One person died in the fire which started on Saturday morning and was fuelled by a strong south-easterly wind. At least 200 homes were destroyed and over 800 people displaced. Provincial government officials visited the area on Saturday afternoon to discuss immediate and future plans for it. Western Cape MEC for Human Settlements, Bonginkosi Madikizela says those who have been displaced will be resettled. “We can clear the site, and make sure that the right people, those who were affected, are identified properly, and then we can resettle them. I think it is a matter of a week, but in terms of long term plans, it’s something that we need to discuss so that we can see what we can do in terms of long-term plans.”
