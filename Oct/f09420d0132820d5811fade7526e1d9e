Some of these projects have been proposed by our various government structures, they have been truly methodical in crafting the projects that they believe will add to economic growth. The project book is alive, dynamic portfolio that will be updated as new projects emerge. “ Meanwhile, investment envoy Trevor Manuel says the commitment made by local companies to invest in the economy will send a strong message to international investors. Manuel says the campaigns to attract investors will now be taken beyond major financial hubs of the world. He says as one of the four Presidential investment envoys, they will visit the US next week. “We need to get out there and be talking to people, part of what we are doing is we are going the US next week , we will go again. But NY is a financial capital,  to get the capital out of the US you need to move to the mid-west to cities like Chicago, Detroit, – go to the west coast and it can’t just be a visit to the US.” Click below for more on the story:
