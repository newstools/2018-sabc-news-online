The African National Congress Youth League (ANCYL) in Limpopo is accusing the provincial mother body of failing to take action against the mayors of the municipalities which invested millions of rand in VBS Mutual Bank. The league’s acting secretary Matome Moremi says the mayors of the affected municipalities must immediately be removed from their positions. This comes after it was revealed that 10 municipalities in the province illegally invested more than R1 billion in the bank. Moremi says, “We are concerned at the speed in which the African National Congress (ANC) in the province is moving in terms of attending to the mayors affected. We’ve seen them throwing the MMs and CFOs under the bus and the mayors are the ones who attended the famous hotel meetings, where this decision of VBS was taken. The mayors must be called to resign before voters resign from voting for the ANC.”
