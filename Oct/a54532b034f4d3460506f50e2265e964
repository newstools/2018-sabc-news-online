Deputy President David Mabuza says he is confident the Revitalised Agreement on Resolution of Conflict in the Republic of South Sudan will sustain the prevailing positive mood in that country.  Mabuza has concluded his Working Visit to South Sudan.  He held talks with President Salva Kiir Mayardit, the leadership of the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement (SPLM), the leadership of the South Sudan Opposition Alliance, the leadership of Former Detainees (FDs), the Convenors of the National Dialogue and members of Diplomatic Corps in Juba. Despite a peace agreement signed by the warring parties in 2015, the people of South Sudan have still not seen an end to the fighting. Basic infrastructure such as health and education facilities have been destroyed, 2 million people have fled the country, another 2 million are displaced internally, while more than 6 million are food insecure. Deputy President Mabuza called on all stakeholders to be steadfast in their efforts of implementing the peace agreement for the benefit of the people of South Sudan and the continent. He says all the role players committed to work together in achieving lasting peace, and South Africa will continue to provide support and share her own experience learned from transition to democracy. The Deputy President has departed for the Republic of Sudan.
