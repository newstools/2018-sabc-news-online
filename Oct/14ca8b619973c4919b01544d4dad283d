The arrests of officials from the North West Health Department are imminent, following investigations into allegations of corruption. This is according to the provincial Health MEC, Dr Magome Masike, who provided an update on the investigations, during a visit to the Moses Kotane Hospital near Rustenburg. The North West Health Department is currently under the administration of the national Department of Health. A visit to the Moses Kotane Hospital in Rustenburg has shed light on the progress made by authorities, who committed to curbing corruption in the North West Health Department. The R30-million was allegedly paid to the Mediosa Company in advance, before it provided mobile clinic services to the department. Masike says wrongdoing has been identified, responsible officials have been charged internally and the cases of some officials have been referred to law enforcement agencies for further investigation. “I have opened criminal cases as early as 2012/2013. I had meetings with NPA and the police to brief me on what is happening. I can tell you now, what they are telling me now, is that arrests are eminent. I do not have arresting powers. I rely on the police.” The MEC says interventions by the national government are bearing fruit. “The culture of doing as you wish, to steal for instance, you’ll be punished if that happens. So, we are beginning to see a normal Department of Health, what it used to be without thieves. It’s not normal to steal. How do you pay R30 million to people who have not started working? How do you do it?” Meanwhile, patients at the Moses Kotane Hospital have expressed different views regarding health services at the centre. Masike has applauded the Moses Kotane Hospital for improving its services to communities.
