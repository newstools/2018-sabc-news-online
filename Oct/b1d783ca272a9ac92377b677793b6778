The family of late struggle stalwart, Eric “Stalin”Mtshali, says he will be laid to rest next weekend. The family has expressed their gratitude over the support they have received and messages of condolences from across the country. The 84-year-old African National Congress (ANC) and South African Communist Party (SACP) veteran died on Friday following a long illness. Yesterday, mourners including ANC NEC member Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, party provincial chairperson Sihle Zikalala and SACP provincial chairperson James Nxumalo visited the family. His daughter, Lindiwe Mtshali says even in death, her father remains a unifier in the country. “What is warming is that my father was a unifier. He didn’t like the current factions that you see in the ANC currently. So to see all of them here united like this and in good spirits, it’s comforting as a family because then you know that he’s smiling wherever he is,” adds Mtshali.
