Eastern Cape Department of Transport MEC, Weziwe Tikana visited the families of the 13 people who died in a car crash between Mqanduli and Coffee Bay over the weekend. The deceased, who include a Bishop and his wife were coming from a church service in Mqanduli when the crash occurred. It is alleged that the unlicensed driver failed to negotiate a sharp curve and the bakkie rolled into an embankment. Of the 19 passengers on board, 13 perished on the spot, while six are still in a critical condition. Tikana says this is one of the worst accidents in the province. She adds, “If you look at most accidents in the province, the initial cause is that the driver is not in the possession of a driver’s license and also overload.” Speaking on behalf of the family of the Bishop who perished with his wife, Ngqukumbana Makhubalo says the family is shocked and their children are left without parents. Makhubalo says, “There is no one here, the whole family is gone, we are only left with four kids and I do not know how I am going to raise them. I really do not know how I am going to handle and raise infants. This is the second incident, my brother and his wife died and left three infants. We hope that God will be on our side.”
