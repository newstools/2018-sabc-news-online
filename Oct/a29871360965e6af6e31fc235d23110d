Some VBS employees have finally signed retrenchment notices after days of rejecting them. The curator announced that 100 workers are being retrenched while 25 will remain. The workers held a meeting with representatives of the office of the curator and the bank’s Human Resource Department in Thohoyandou on Thursday. Other workers are still refusing to sign the letters. One of those who signed is Nkateko Nwayila. She says, “The meeting was not fruitful. We just feel we are tired of coming here everyday. It’s stressing us and it gives us bad memories about us and customers insulting us. So, sometimes we just have to sign and forget everything about VBS. I have signed the retrenchment letter. I’m no longer working for VBS. I’m going to start applying again and face life outside VBS.” Meanwhile, the Limpopo government says there’s lack of co-operation from some municipal managers who invested in the VBS Mutual Bank. The provincial government is conducting its own forensic investigation on the collapse and looting of VBS. Two senior ANC officials, Treasurer Danny Msiza and Deputy Chairperson and Vhembe District Executive Mayor, Florence Radzilani have been deeply implicated by the Reserve Bank report. Government Spokesperson Phuti Seloba says the officials in the Collins Chabane Municipality in Malamulele are protecting each other. “A small municipality like Collins Chabane, they have got very few directors there recently appointed. Definitely, they know, amongst themselves, who authorised the money to go there. We believe that in every municipality the information is there and the leaders – if they wanted to be accountable – they could initiate action.” Watch video below for more on the story:
