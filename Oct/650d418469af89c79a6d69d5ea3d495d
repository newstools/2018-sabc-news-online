About 200 Ethiopian businessmen have gathered outside Emmanuel church in Heilbron in the Free State. They are marching to the local police station to hand over a memorandum to station commander. The Ethiopians left their shops in Phiritona Township after angry residents looted them during a service delivery protest in July. They say they want to be re-integrated into the community so that they can make a living. The Ethiopians Â have been given refuge at the church in town.
