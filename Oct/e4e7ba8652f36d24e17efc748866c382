The South African Revenue Services Commission of Inquiry will continue on Monday morning in Pretoria with expected testimonies from SARS officials, including Employment Relations Executive, Luther Lebelo. He is making a third appearance before the Commission after he accused the Commission of treating him like a criminal on trial during his first appearance. It has emerged that he had allegedly ignored a legal opinion advising him against pursuing charges against former SARS commissioner Ivan Pillay over the establishment of the so- called rogue unit. Last week, it also emerged that Lebelo used up to one million rand of taxpayers’ money on legal fees to help him prepare for his appearance before the Commission. Testifying before the commission last week, acting SARS commissioner Mark Kingon apologised to the president and South Africans for the failures at the revenue services. He said that SARS had undergone a lot of trauma over the past four years, however he was taking decisive steps to turn the organisation around. His comments were challenged by the commission chair retired judge Robert Nugent who questioned if whether Kingon’s efforts would not be in vein as suspended SARS commissioner Tom Moyane still held the leadership position at the revenue service. In his interim report, Nugent recommend that President Cyril Ramaphosa fire Moyane with immediate effect. The president has given Moyane until Wednesday to respond to Nugent’s recommendation.
