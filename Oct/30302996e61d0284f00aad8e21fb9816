President Cyril Ramaphosa leads a South African delegation to the 11th Session of the Bi-National Commission (BNC) to the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The Commission was officially launched in 2004 in DRC capital, Kinshasa. Development, eradication of poverty and improving people’s lives are central to the BNC of both countries. Diplomatic relations between the two countries were established in 1992, leading to both upgrading their liaison offices to embassies. Their relations have since been consolidated. The 10th Commission was held in Pretoria where both Heads of States – former President Jacob Zuma at the time and President Joseph Kabila were accompanied by senior government officials. Agreements, commitments and recommendations made during the 9th Session of the BNC were signed. These included cooperation in fields of Politics and Governance, Defence and Security, Finance and Infrastructure. The two countries expressed commitment to the African Unity specifically the implementation of Agenda 2063 and their common view on the reform of the Security Council and the IMF. With the 11th session taking place in the DRC, both Pretoria and Kinshasa are expected to take their agreements forward. President Cyril Ramaphosa visited the DRC earlier this year. It was his first visit since taking office. The two leaders exchanged views on the bilateral relations as well as the electoral and security situation. This 11th session of the Bi-national Commission will promote and enhance cooperation in various sectors of government. With the DRC coming up to elections, Pretoria stands ready to assist within its framework. Both Presidents Ramaphosa and Kabila will chair the Commission jointly and are expected to sign several agreements. Click below for more on the story:
