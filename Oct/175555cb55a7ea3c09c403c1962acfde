The killing of Khashoggi a Washington Post columnist and a critic of Saudi Arabia’s de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammedbin Salman has sparked global outrage and pitched the world ‘stop oil exporter into crisis. The incident has put the West’s relationship with Riyadhinto sharp focus, given scepticism about Saudi Arabia’s shifting explanations of the killing at the Istanbul consulate.

She was speaking at a joint news conference with French President Emmanuel Macron as well as Russian President Vladimir Putin and Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan at the conclusion of a four-way summit on Syria. Macron said that any decisions that would be taken, including potential sanctions, must be made at the European level to ensure coordination. Merkel has previously vowed to halt all German arms exports to Saudi Arabia until the killing is explained.
