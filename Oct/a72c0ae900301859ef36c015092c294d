The African National Congress(ANC) is calling for unity within the tripartite alliance. ANC national chairperson Gwede Mantashe made the call amid threats by the SACP to walk away from the alliance if it’s not reconfigured to shift power from the ANC as the alliance leader. Mantashe says if the alliance splits, both the ANC and SACP will be negatively affected as it might lose power. He says: “If the party walks away, that’s the formula for loosing power and for the ANC to lose power, everybody will lose power.” He also called for an end to the Nkosaza Dlamini Zuma and CR17 factions in the governing party. “We must remove the tags of NDZ and CR17. The is no such thing, there is only the ANC.” Mantashe also conceded that there are leadership problems in many municipalities due to lack of capacity of the elected councillors. He says the governing party should re-look at its process of electing councillors and municipal officials. He says the reason most municipalities are in a mess is because “we don’t do the selection process properly”.
