The Department of Correctional Services says Nigerian pastor, Timothy Omotoso is not being given preferential treatment while he remains in custody. Omotoso and two co-accused are on trial in the Port Elizabeth High Court, facing 97 sex related charges. The first witness, 22-year-old Cheryl Zondi, testified last week that the controversial pastor sexually groomed and raped her since she was 14-years-old. While Omotoso remains in custody, his two co-accused, Lusanda Sulani and Zukiswa Sitho have been granted bail. Supporters of Zondi and other witnesses, who are yet to testify, allege that Omotoso is receiving preferential treatment while in custody. Correctional Services spokesperson Singabakho Nxumalo says: “Omotoso is a detainee and what we do is we separate sentenced inmates from those who have court cases. So he is kept in a section specifically for those detainees and he is in a single cell as a normal detainee like all others.” “The only application that was made and granted was for a TV set and that was granted by the head of the centre.”
