Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba has apologised in a tweet in which he says that a videotape of a sexual nature is circulating in political circles. He claims that a leaked video of a sexual nature is at the centre of blackmail and extortion attempts against him. Gigaba says the video was stolen from his cellphone and that he became aware of this just after his appointment as finance minister in March, 2017. He explains that the video dates back to the period immediately following his appointment as Minister of Finance and that its content was only meant to be viewed by his wife and himself. In a series of Tweets, he apologises to his family and the public for the – quote – ‘pain and embarrassment’ that the circulation of the video will cause. This video has been at the centre of a number of blackmail and extortion attempts, dating back to the period immediately following my appointment as Minister of Finance, on 31 March 2017, all of which I have steadfastly refused to entertain… — Malusi Gigaba (@mgigaba) October 28, 2018
