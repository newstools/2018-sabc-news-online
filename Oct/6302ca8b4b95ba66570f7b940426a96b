Johannesburg waste management entity Pikitup is operating with limited capacity because its fleet contract has expired. This could result in some Johannesburg residents’ refuse not being collected. Johannesburg’s Environment and Infrastructure MMC, Nico de Jager, says refuse removal services will resume by Thursday. He warned that those officials responsible for failing to renew the contract will face consequences. He says they hope they will be signing the contract on Wednesday. “Some of our officials were not on top of this process right from the beginning, and we will follow the process to see who should take responsibility for the fact that there was a bit of a delay. In essence, it only means that there’s a delay for about one to one-and-a-half days.”
