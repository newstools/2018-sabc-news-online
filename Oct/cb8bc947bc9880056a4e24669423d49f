Gauteng Roads and Transport MEC Ismail Vadi has encouraged commuters to make use of public transport amid news of yet another hefty fuel hike. The price of fuel will go up by between 99 cents and R 1.24 cents a litre after midnight Tuesday. Vadi admits that the country does not have a sufficient and reliable public transport system. However, he says there are pockets of excellence in Gauteng in the form of the Gautrain and Rea Vaya. He says lift clubs are also an alternative. Vadi has launched the October Transport Month Campaign in Johannesburg. “And now with the fuel increase, the recent increase, this is really going to bite into people’s pocket. We have to begin to consider alternatives. You know, a casual glance at any of our freeways during the peak hours, you’ll find so many people. You know it is many cars and one person. I don’t think it’s sustainable. If we’re not going opt for public transport, I think we are  going to have to start seriously considering car-sharing, lift clubs, ride-sharing initiatives so that we can really bring down the congestion and cost of transport.” The weak rand is the main reason for the steep fuel price hikes that will come into effect. The rand has been on the back foot amid concerns about emerging markets as well as the US tightening of economic policy. Click below for more on the story:
