The Gauteng African National Congress (ANC) Integrity Committee is expected to make known its decision on the fate of former Health MEC, Qedani Mahlangu, and party’s chief whip in the provincial legislature ,Brian Hlongwa, on Tuesday. Both were recently re-elected to the ANC’s Provincial Executive Committee. Mahlangu was found responsible for the Life Esidimeni tragedy in which over 140 mentally-ill patients died after they were moved from the Esidimeni centres to under-resourced NGO’s in order to cut costs. Hlongwa on the other hand has been implicated in a report by the Specialised Investigations Unit in alleged corruption amounting to one-point-two-billion-rand while he was Health MEC. Democratic Alliance’s (DA) Jack Bloom has for years being pushing in the Gauteng Legislature for the two senior ANC officials to be held to account. “The DA believes both Brian Hlongwa and Qedani Mahlangu should be kicked out of senior ANC position. But the ANC must not do this because we having elections but must do it for the right reasons but must ensure that both are prosecuted in court and get punished for what they did,” says Bloom.
