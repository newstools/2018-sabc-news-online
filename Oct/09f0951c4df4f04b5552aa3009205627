Cosatu general secretary Bheki Ntshalintshali says they also hope many more ministers would resign for their alleged corrupt dealings. He says,”We would be happy to see many Nhlanhla Nene’s coming forward, there are a number of ministers in the Cosatu list who should be going and have not gone, others have been declared by the court to be lying etc. And I think they need to follow in his footsteps and do the right thing and resign and not to force the President to expel them, they have to resign.” In the meanwhile, Business Unity South Africa (BUSA) says former finance minister Nhlanhla Nene’s resignation is a ground breaking step by a public representative. BUSA president Sipho Pityana says they hope other public officials implicated in corruption in their dealings with the Gupta family will also follow suit.  Nene resigned from his post after a public outcry about his private meetings with the Guptas while he was Deputy Finance minister and Minister between 2010 and 2014. Pityana says he hopes Nene will take advantage of the State Capture Commission to disclose what was discussed in this meetings. “This issue is not so much that they met with the Guptas, but what is it that was talked about, where there deals done? Where there favours asked for? Did he follow through on those favours?, at what point did he decide that it was no longer good enough to do so. The fact that he hid the meetings suggest there was something untoward in the conversations that happened there, so that’s where public trust come from. It’s not so much that the meetings happened, is what happened in the meetings.” Related video below:
