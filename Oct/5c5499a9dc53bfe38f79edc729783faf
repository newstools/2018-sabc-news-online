Outgoing Cape Town Mayor Patricia de Lille has described as baseless all allegations of corruption against her. She was addressing the Cape Town Press Club two days before she is scheduled to officially leave office. De Lille announced two months ago that her resignation would take effect on 31 October, following months of political squabbles with her party the Democratic Alliance (DA). She says she has never made any deal with the DA to drop any charges against her. De Lille says she is going to court before Wednesday to seek clarity on the two reports that have been issued by law firm Bowman Gilfillan. She says the first report cleared her of any wrong doing while the second one says she could face criminal charges. De Lille says she is taking both reports on review.  “I have to clear my name again like I’ve cleared it at all these other instances. So I’m consulting with my lawyers. So unfortunately I’m going back to court and my mandate to my lawyers is that I want to go to court before Wednesday to try to review and to set aside this report so that is where I am.  I’m taking it one day at a time.” Click below for more on the story:
