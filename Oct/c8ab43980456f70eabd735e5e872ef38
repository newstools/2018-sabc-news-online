Bathabile says Molewa was a unifier in the ANC. “As an honour to sis Edna who did not melt like ice when it was difficult, who played a very critical role in uniting comrades from KZN as women’s league we’re going to put her name in the book we’re writing of 100 phenomenal women in South Africa. Amandla, imbokodo.”   Former Transport minister Dipuo Peters has urged South Africans, particularly members of the ANC, to preserve the legacy of the late Environmental Affairs minister Edna Molewa.   Dr Edna Molewa will be laid to rest at the Zandfontein cemetery in Pretoria West.
