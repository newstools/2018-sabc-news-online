The African National Congress (ANC) national leadership has refuted claims that the National Executive Committee (NEC) that met at the weekend has decided to ask the newly-elected Buffalo City regional chairperson, Pumlani Mkolo and Nelson Mandela Metro mayoral committee member Andile Lungisa, to step down. The two are facing charges of fraud and money-laundering allegedly meant for Nelson Mandela Bay’s stagnant Integrated Public Transport System. They made a brief appearance in the Port Elizabeth Commercial Crimes Court earlier on Tuesday and their case was postponed to November 2nd. ANC national spokesperson Pule Mabe says the issue of Lungisa and Mkolo was not on the agenda of the NEC. “I am a member of the NEC and I am the one who was chairing the press conference addressed by the Secretary-General. So the statement issued yesterday outlined the decision of the NEC, and the issue of Andile and Mkolo were not in the statement of the NEC.” However, Mabe has confirmed that some branches in the Buffalo City region have lodged a formal complaint against the election of Mkolo. “Where there are concerns raised those are concerns that will be addressed within the structures of the ANC and as soon as there is a decision that in those concerns that have been raised we will be able convey”. Mkolo has declined to comment saying the issue has not been formally communicated to him. WATCH RELATED VIDEO BELOW:
