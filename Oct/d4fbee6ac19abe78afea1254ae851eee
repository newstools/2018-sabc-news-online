Police Minister Bheki Cele is expected to visit various townships in Cape Town to establish whether the deployment of more police in the areas earlier in the year has made any difference in curbing criminal activities and gang violence. Spokesperson for the Western Cape Police Commissioner, Novela Potelwa, says Cele will be accompanied by his deputy Bongani Mkongi, the National Police Commissioner, Khehla Sithole as well as the provincial SAPS management. Potelwa says Cele will inspect a parade of members deployed to fight gang violence and other serious violent crimes. “They will also visit communities such as Uitsig, Philippi East and Browns Farm, where police earlier this year set up base camps for prompt response to incidents of violence and shooting. The delegation will also interact with the affected communities in order to ascertain whether interventions deployed have yielded any results.” Click related video below:
