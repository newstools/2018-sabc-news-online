Former security policeman Joao Rodrigues will be back in court on Monday, on charges relating to the 1971 murder of anti-apartheid activist Ahmed Timol. He is expected to apply for a stay of prosecution based on his age, believed to be 79, and the argument that the murder took place too long ago for justice to take its course. Imtiaz Cajee, the nephew of Ahmed Timol, says the family would accept a plea bargain just to establish the truth about his death. Cajee also says that if Rodrigues will not disclose the truth then a trial date must be set and he must face the full might of the law. “We are hoping and praying that judge Monama  fast tracks the processes of the actual court proceedings finally commencing and that a trial date be set. Families want answers, they want closure. Rodrigues is living, he was the last person in the room with my uncle before he claimed that my uncle had committed suicide. So our plea once again goes to him. He must make full disclosure, make full confessions and you know the family’s interested in a plea bargain and if he’s not prepared to do so, you know he must face the full wrath of the law.”
