The bail application of eleven accused of alleged links to terror organisation ISIS is due to continue in the Verulam Magistrate’s Court on Thursday. The State is expected to continue presenting its affidavit in opposing bail. The accused are being charged in connection with a spate of bomb scares at KwaZulu-Natal malls, and an attack on a Verulam mosque in May this year. They are facing charges of murder, attempted murder, and offences relating to using explosive devices, arson, extortion and terrorism. The court has heard that the Hawks found various items at the home of the alleged kingpin – Farhad Hoomer – in Reservoir Hills, Durban. The State says these include incendiary devices similar to those found at the sites of the bombs scares, ISIS flags and a detailed manual providing information on how to carry out terrorist acts – including bomb making plans.
