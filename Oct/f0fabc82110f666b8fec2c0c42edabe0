Democratic Alliance (DA) leader Mmusi Maimane says President Cyril Ramaphosa should tell the truth about having prior knowledge on the looting of VBS Mutual Bank when he appears in Parliament on Thursday. A South African Reserve Bank (SARB) forensic report implicated at least 50 people and companies for allegedly receiving billions of rand from VBS. Maimane says he has written to Speaker Baleka Mbete requesting that the VBS question be urgently added to the list that is scheduled to be posed to the President. The DA says allegations that Ramaphosa was aware of what was happening at VBS is a matter of national importance. If true it has serious legal ramifications for the President. “The statement issued by the President on this matter does not provide clarity on his involvement. The President as failed to tell the nation when he became of aware of the matter and when he acted,” says Maimane.
