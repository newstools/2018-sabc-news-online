Finance Minister Tito Mboweni‘s Medium Term Budget Policy Statement (MTBPS) is expected to give clarity on government’s intention to reprioritise R50-billion of funds to stimulate the economy and create jobs. President Cyril Ramaphosa announced the stimulus package in September. Economists say re-prioritising funds is the better option rather than increasing taxes. Mboweni will deliver his maiden medium term budget on Wednesday. Economist Mike Schussler says: “I think by the time we reach the budget in February, we would see even more reprioritisation. We have a strong finance minister now and there is a better chance that we are going to see more spending on infrastructure than on wages. But it might not all happen in one go.” Watch the video below for related news:
