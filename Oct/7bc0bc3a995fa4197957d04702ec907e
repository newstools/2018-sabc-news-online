eThekwini Expanded Public Works Programme (EPWP) employees have embarked on protest action. Litter and debris has been strewn across major roads and carriageways at Springefield, Newlands, Clairwood, Overport, Isipingo and the Durban Central Business District (CBD). eThekwini Solid Waste Unit Head Raymond Rampersad says temporary employees employed under government’s EPWP initiative are now demanding permanent positions. Rampersad says while management is unable to employ all 1200 workers on a permanent basis due to budget constraints, they have committed to looking at vacant posts and taking some staff on permanently. Rampersad adds that the municipality will continue to engage with aggrieved EPWP employees to find solutions to staff challenges. “They are supposed to be here for six months. Unfortunately, the ones striking have been on contract since 2014 and their contracts are due to end at the end of this month. I’m not sure what the way forward is but I am hoping we will be able to extend their contracts for another six months. They are providing a valuable service that complements our permanent staff. It’s much needed and so we will continue to engage with them.”
