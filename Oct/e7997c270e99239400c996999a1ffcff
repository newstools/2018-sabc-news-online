Metro Police in Johannesburg are monitoring the situation in Hillbrow after hundreds of protestors took to the streets earlier Saturday, burning tyres and blocking streets. Police fired rubber bullets at the protesters. The crowd which was protesting against drugs and drug dealers started acting violently and police had to intervene. JMPD Spokesperson Wayne Minnaar says it is unclear whether Saturday’s protest could be linked to the “shutdown” protests around the city. “Well, the protest had taken place in Riley Road in Berea. Approximately 100 protestors had burnt tyres and were chanting and singing, protesting against drugs and drug dealers in the area. However, the road is now cleared. There are officers in the area monitoring the situation, but it is calm and the situation is back to normal.”
