City Power has opened a case of armed robbery after six suspects stormed the substation in Mulbarton, in the south of Johannesburg around midnight on Saturday. The suspects allegedly held security guards hostage before stealing equipment from the site. City of Johannesburg Mayor, Herman Mashaba has called on the public to come forward with any information that may lead to the suspects’ arrest. Mayoral Spokesperson, Luyanda Mfeka says the robbers stole copper cables. “The six robbers arrived in a truck and overpowered the security guards. They then proceeded to break into the on-site storage and loaded a five-hundred-metre drum with copper cables that they had found in the area. When City Power electricians, who were working on the outage in Glenvista arrived at the substation trying to fix the fault, they were held up as well.”
