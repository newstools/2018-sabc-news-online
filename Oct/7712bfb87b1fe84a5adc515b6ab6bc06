Emotions are high at the Port Elizabeth High Court as the first witness, Cheryl Zondi is testifying about how Nigerian Pastor Timothy Omotoso ordered her to join him in bed, while fondling himself. The 22 year-old woman says she was confused when the pastor asked her if she has a love life, as she was 14 at the time. About 49 witnesses are expected to take a stand during the trial. Zondi says this incident happened during bedtime at Omotosoâ€™s house in Durban, when she travelled for a church meeting. She alleges that she was 14 when Omotoso ordered her to take off her clothes, which she obeyed and did. Zondi alleges that Omotoso noticed how inexperienced she was, and led her by climbing on top, and sexually assaulted her. The trial of the controversial pastor continues, and members of the Jesus Dominion Church continue singing outside the court, showing support for their pastor.
