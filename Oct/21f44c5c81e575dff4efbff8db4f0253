Hundreds of home-based health care workers in the Northern Cape have threatened to go on strike if the provincial department of health forges ahead with plans to require matric certification for certain workers. The workers , who are represented by union South African Liberated Public Sector Workers Union, represent about 700 staffers in the province. The department says it is still in negotiations with the union, but workers say their appeals have fallen on deaf ears “When we went for this job, nobody told us about matric. They just took our CVs and everything that we had. And now all of a sudden when the department is talking about absorption, matric is mentioned and experience is mentioned.”
