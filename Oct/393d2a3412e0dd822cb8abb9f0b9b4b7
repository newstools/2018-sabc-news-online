The driver of the bus in which nine people were killed after it overturned outside Polokwane two weeks ago is appearing in the local magistrateâ€™s court on Tuesday on culpable homicide charges. George Themba 40, allegedly tried to flee to Zimbabwe following his discharge from hospital days after the accident. Temba was arrested at the Beitbridge border post in Musina as he was allegedly trying to enter Zimbabwe two days after the accident. Traffic authorities suspect he lost control of the Intercape bus which was travelling from Zimbabwe to Gauteng, when it veered off the road. He appeared briefly in court last Tuesday, where the case was postponed to give the state enough time to compile his profile.
