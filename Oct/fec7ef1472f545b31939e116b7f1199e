African National Congress (ANC) provincial spokesperson in Limpopo Donald Selamolela says the party strongly affirms that its officials implicated in the VBS Mutual Bank scandal will be dealt with without fear or favour. Selamolela was speaking at the SA Communist Party (SACP) provincial general council meeting in Polokwane in Limpopo. The party’s provincial treasurer, Dany Msiza and deputy chairperson Florence Radzilani are implicated by the VBS audit report. Selamolela echoed comments made by ANC national chairperson Gwede Mantashe on Saturday. “Relating the VBS – the ANC strongly affirms its position that all those that are found to have their hands in the junk, and all those that are found to be implicated in this matter, must be taken to task – we will deal with the issue of VBS without fear or favour.” Mantashe stated that a Commission may be appointed to investigate the VBS collapse and looting saga. Addressing an ANC event in Polokwane, he called for all those implicated to own to their mistakes through a commission. “ I suspect ‘apho ko ba ne’ VBS commission… it’s coming because if we think that we can hide we’re committing a mistake… we can’t hide, we must own up, because if we can’t own up it means we can’t be trusted with any other thing people must own and stand up and say this is what happened.” On Saturday President Cyril Ramaphosa also said that those implicated in the VBS saga must be held accountable. Ramaphosa was speaking at an ANC fundraising dinner in Empangeni, KwaZulu-Natal. WATCH RELATED VIDEO BELOW: READ THE REPORT BELOW:
