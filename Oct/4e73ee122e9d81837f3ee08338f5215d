Struggle stalwart Albertina Sisulu has continued to provide for the community of Orlando West in Soweto even in death. Earlier on Sunday, the Energy Department renovated the Holy Cross Anglican Church Pre-school which is a stone’s throw from where the Sisulus lived. The creche and its activities have long been intertwined with MaSisulu and her family. She took the institution under her wing as children loved her. Former headmistress and teacher at the creche for nearly 40 years, Miriam Kgole has fond memories of MaSisulu. “She would volunteer to do aftercare. We were struggling and would have to stay at the crèche until late because the parents were unable to pay aftercare and some of them would work until late. So, we would have to stay. When MaSisulu would return from work she would say we should bring the children to her as we are still young and must go home and cook. She would then keep the children until their parents picked them up and she did this for no charge.” Click below for more on the story:
