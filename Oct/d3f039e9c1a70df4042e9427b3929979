The fight against cross border crime has intensified in Mpumalanga with law enforcement agencies operating on the border with Mozambique have called on communities to help identify illegal activities in their respective areas. Members of the South African National Defense Force (SANDF) recovered seven stolen vehicles en-route to Mozambique recently. SANDF Major Malebo Manganye says the vehicles are parked here while criminals monitor the movement of the SANDF members operating on the borderline. A Mozambique national was arrested when the vehicle were recovered, while others fled. Provincial Community Safety liaison Joseph Mabuza says there’s a syndicate operating across the country. “We are dealing with a syndicate operating all over South Africa. There are people who are employed to steal these vehicles others will produce fake number plates, others produce license discs so that if you look at the car everything corresponds. However, law enforcement deployed on the road and border are able to detect that but it reoccurs cooperation from the communities as well.” Bakkies and Sport Utility Vehicles (SUV) are on the radar of the syndicate. Vehicle owners are urged to report stolen motor vehicles immediately.
