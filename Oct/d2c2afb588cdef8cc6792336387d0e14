One person has been shot and injured in Bonteheuwel on the Cape Flats. Ward Councillor in the area Angus McKenzie says shootings in the area have been going on unabated for a number of weeks. On Thursday, a 27-year-old man was shot and killed in the area when he was allegedly caught in a gang related incident. In the recent police statistics, Bonteheuwel was named among the most crime-ridden areas in the Western Cape. McKenzie says residents are living in fear. “Forty to 50 shots went off. One person has been shot in the leg and taken to a hospital in the area. It is an absolute war zone at the moment. I encourage all people to be safe, take care and be on the lookout. Stay indoors if needs be.” Watch the video below for related content:
