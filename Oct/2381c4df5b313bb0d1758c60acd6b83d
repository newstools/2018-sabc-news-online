Eleven suspects linked to a cash-in-transit heist three weeks ago at Matlhonyane village in the North West are on Monday expected to continue with their bail application at the Molopo Magistrateâ€™s court in Mahikeng. Qolile Qoma and his 10 accomplices were arrested around villages of Mahikeng and Itsoseng, a few days after one of them confessed to the police about the planned heist. Last week the court postponed their application citing that enough time is needed for all the applicants. The suspects, who some of them worked for the same private security company ferrying cash, surrounded the cash in transit vehicle and fired shots forcing it to a halt. The robbers used explosive devices on the van and took an estimated R1.5 million in cash. The cash-in-transit vehicle was on its way to Itsoseng.
