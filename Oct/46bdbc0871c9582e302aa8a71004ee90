Limpopo Agriculture MEC Basikopo Makamu has appealed to community members to take their domestic animals for vaccination to prevent them from infecting humans with rabies. Makamu has made the appeal during the provincial World Rabies Day celebrations at Mokwakwaila, outside Modjadjiskloof. Makamu and his health counterpart Dr Phophi Ramathuba kick-started the campaign by vaccinating some animals.  He has called on those in attendance to spread the message. “Prevention for rabies is better than looking for medicine to cure but also to disseminate information to all, but also to launch so that all the people are able to take their dogs for vaccination. We have started symbolic with the MEC Ramathuba because we want make sure that we make zero the death by this rabies by 2030.” Meanwhile, Dr Ramathuba says in the past three years, there has been a decrease in the number of people infected with rabies after being bitten by domestic animals. “We have seen that the dog bites might still be there but the number of deaths, we have moved down from 49 to only one death and that tells you that there are really positive results on this campaign.”
