Delays in the submission of reports from probation officers has resulted in yet another postponement of the case against the former Parktown Boys High school water polo coach. Collan Rex 22, who was found guilty on 144 charges of sexual offences and common assault, appeared briefly in the High Court sitting at the Palm Ridge Magistrate’s Court on Gauteng’s East Rand. The abuse by Rex came to light after he was caught on a surveillance camera allegedly fondling a 15 year-old pupil in the common room of the school’s hostel in November 2016. His case has been postponed to the November 27, 2018. Judge Peet Johnson said he is not happy with the postponement. He expressed his frustration at the delays of the reports, saying it is extremely unacceptable and cannot happen again. Meanwhile, the court room was filled to capacity with victims’ parents. However, many left angry and disappointed and even refused to speak to the media.
