The Economic  Freedom Fighters (EFF)  has rejected Finance Minister, Nhlanhla Nene‘s apology saying it will only accept it if he resigns. On Friday, Nene apologised to South Africans for meeting with members of the Gupta family at their residence between 2010 and 2014.   In a statement, Nene said while it was customary for the Finance Minister and his deputy to meet with fellow South Africans and stakeholders, meeting with the Guptas at their home and not in his office or public was a mistake. However, EFF deputy president Floyd Shivambu says Nene should not be trusted to oversee the country’s finances.   Nene on Friday apologised to South Africans for meeting with members of the Gupta family at their residence between 2010 and 2014. In a statement, Nene said while it is customary for the Finance Minister and his deputy to meet with fellow South Africans and stakeholders, he said meeting the Guptas at their home was a mistake and lapse in judgement. Appearing before the state capture commission of inquiry this week, Finance Minister Nhlanhla Nene admitted to meeting with member of the Gupta family four times while he served at deputy finance minister and chairperson of the PIC. During his testimony, Nene said that his meetings with members of the Gupta family were more casual than business. He said that when he first met the Guptas, they were at pains to explain that they didn’t do business with government. Nene denied allegations that he used his positions as minister and deputy minister to help advance the family’s business interests.
