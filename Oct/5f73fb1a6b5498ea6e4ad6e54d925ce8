The African National Congress Veterans League in Limpopo wants two senior provincial ANC officials implicated in the VBS Mutual Bank saga to resign or be removed from positions of leadership. The ANC Provincial Treasurer Danny Msiza and Deputy Chairperson and Vhembe District Executive Mayor Florence Radzilani are deeply implicated in the looting of VBS Mutual Bank, according to the Reserve Bank’s forensic report. Briefing the media in Polokwane, Provincial Veterans League Chairperson Jacob Marule says these two officials have brought the party into disrepute. South African Communist Party Central Executive Member Thulas Nxesi says the party leadership has not yet discussed the Reserve Bank’s report on looting at VBS Mutual Bank. The party’s Provincial Secretary in Limpopo, Gilbert Kganyago, is among the people implicated in the VBS scandal. Nxesi says they will look into the report at a later stage.
