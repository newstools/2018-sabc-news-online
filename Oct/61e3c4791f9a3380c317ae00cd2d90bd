Humanitarian group Gift of the Givers will be sending the first of two teams to the tsunami and quake hit island of Sulawesi in Indonesia. Over 1 300 people are known to have died after the tsunami and 7.5 magnitude quake hit the region. More than 200 000 survivors are battling thirst and hunger, with food and clean water in short supply. Local hospitals are reported to be overwhelmed by the number of injured people. Gift of the Givers founder Imtiaz Sooliman says they are going there to provide disaster relief efforts. “The first team will leave on Wednesday night. It’s predominantly a search and rescue team or a medical component. The primary aim of the search and rescue team is to assist the Indonesian government in the search for survivors or those trapped in different parts of the earthquake zone, and at the same time, of course, they will also find bodies, which is just as important because families need closure. Whilst doing the search and rescue efforts, we will also being supplying food rice, can food and other items,” says Sooliman.
