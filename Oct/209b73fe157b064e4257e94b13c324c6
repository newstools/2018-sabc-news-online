Duduzane Zuma‘s culpable homicide case will resume in the Randburg Magistrate’s Court north of Johannesburg on Friday morning. Former President Jacob Zuma‘s son is charged with two counts of culpable homicide relating to a fatal car crash on the M1 highway in Johannesburg. Phumzile Dube was killed when Duduzane’s car collided with a taxi in which she was travelling. Another fellow passenger, Nanki Mashaba, died in hospital a few weeks later. During his last court appearance in August Zuma arrived in court accompanied by his father. The matter sat briefly before the presiding magistrate postponed it. This was to allow his defence time to go through the charge sheet in preparation for the pre-trial. Security was tight with only the Zumas and their legal team, as well as the media, allowed inside the court room. WATCH RELATED VIDEO:
