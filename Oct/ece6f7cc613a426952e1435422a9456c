The ANC-aligned student organisation South African Student Congress (Sasco) in KwaZulu-Natal has denied that the organisation is facing a decline in support and that it is in crisis. It has accused the media of exaggeration, following their loss of support in four SRC elections. The student movement recently lost control of four university campuses including the University of Zululand, Mangosuthu University of Technology, The Durban University of Technology’s Durban Campus and the University of KwaZulu-Natal’s Westville Campus to the EFF Student Command. “The propaganda that we are speaking about from the media is that you will remember that in 2017 we had SRC election in all these campuses and we won all those campuses you are speaking about today. But none of you said anything about that. We are not in denial that there are challenges that we are facing. But it can’t be true that when we are losing one campus out of 100 campuses, therefore it’s a national crisis as (if) students have rejected Sasco across,” says Sasco Provincial Chairperson, Mqondisi Duma.
