Three men are Monday morning expected to appear at the Johannesburg Magistrateâ€™s Court for the murder of Heather Peterson. Peterson was fatally shot in Westbury, Johannesburg, in September in a suspected gang related incident. The suspects made a brief appearance last week before their case was postponed. Peterson was shot and killed after she and her 10 year-old niece were caught in the crossfire of gang violence in Westbury. Her death sparked a wave of violent protests with residents complaining about corrupt police officers, crime and drug related violence. Police Minister Bheki Cele has since instituted a Tactical Response Team in the area. Related Video
