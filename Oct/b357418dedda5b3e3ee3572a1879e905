The water level of dams supplying Cape Town has increased to 76%. Spokesperson for the Western Cape Local Government Ministry, James-Brent Styan says the average level for dams across the province stands at 66%. He says the largest dam, Theewaterskloof near Villiersdorp is 58% full with VoÃ«lvlei dam near Saron standing at 96%. Styan says the Berg River Dam is at 99% while Clanwilliam stands at 100% capacity. The City of Cape Town lowered water restrictions this month from Level 6B to level 5.
