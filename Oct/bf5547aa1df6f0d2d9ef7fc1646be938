Tshwane Metro police say Francis Baard Street between Bosman and Sophie de Bruyn streets in Pretoria have been closed due to protests outside the Pretoria Magistrates Court. This is ahead of the court appearance of the 20-year-old man accused of raping a six-year-old girl at the Dros restaurant in Silverton. The street will be reopened at 15:00. Tshwane Metro Mayor Solly Msimanga is among those who are at the court.  The suspect will appear on charges of rape, possession of drugs, intimidation and assault with the intent to do grievous bodily harm. Several protesting organisations are demanding an end to violence against women and children and say the suspect should not be granted bail. Watch the video below for more:
