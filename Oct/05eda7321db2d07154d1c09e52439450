Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu is celebrating his 87th birthday on Sunday. Itâ€™s likely that he will spend his birthday in hospital in 2018 undergoing a series of tests. He has battled prostate cancer in the past and has undergone intravenous treatment on numerous occasions to treat the infection related to the illness. The Tutu Foundation has wished him good health and a speedy recovery. The Arch was admitted to hospital last week Thursday.
