Patients were being treated at a makeshift clinic set up in the Yemeni capital Sanaa on Wednesday for those affected by the cholera epidemic the worst in the world. Yemen has been hit with the epidemic since April 2017. A doctor at Sanaa’s Al Sab’een Hospital told Reuters that nearly ”50% to 80% of the cases turn out to be positive” and that the Ministries of Health, Water and Hygiene need to urgently find a solution to tackle the spread of the fatal disease. Yemen’s cholera outbreak is accelerating rapidly, with roughly 10 000 suspected cases now reported per week, the latest data from the World Health Organization (WHO) showed on Tuesday (October 2). That is double the average rate for the first eight months of the year, when 154 527 suspected cases of cholera which can kill a child within hours if untreated were recorded across the country, with 196 deaths. WHO spokesperson Tarik Jasarevic said 185 160 suspected cholera cases were reported in September. Some 1.8 million Yemeni children are malnourished, making them more vulnerable to disease, the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) says. They include nearly 400 000 whose lives are at risk from severe acute malnutrition. WHO said since Yemen’s cholera epidemic erupted a total of 1.2 million suspected cases have been reported with 2 515 deaths. Children account for 30% of infections. In the first week of September, nearly 11 500 suspected cases were reported, up from 9 425 the week before, according to the WHO. Yemen has been caught up in a proxy-war between Saudi Arabia and its arch-rival Iran, which has killed more than 10 000 people, displaced millions and pushed the impoverished country to the verge of starvation.
