In response to the troubles plaguing the Eldorado Park Community, south of Johannesburg, residents gathered to pray and seek divine intervention. In 2013 the community of Eldorado Park was thrust into the national spotlight after a mother grappling with her 15-year-old sonâ€™s drug addiction wrote an open letter to then President Jacob Zuma, pleading for help in the area that was facing problems like drug abuse and crime. Five years later gangsters and drug lords run the streets. In desperation, locals are now looking towards the heavens for help. Residents are adamant that various government interventions have been fruitless. The residents are now hopeful there will be a turning point. WATCH BELOW:
