The Democratic Alliance (DA)  has called for transparency in relation to China’s R33 billion loan to Eskom. The party had given the power utility 30 days to respond, the deadline has since passed and it says it has not received any information as yet. Mmusi Maimane issued a statement on Sunday, saying his party will not allow China’s debt trap diplomacy and will approach the courts if necessary to ensure that government is transparent with the public about the terms and conditions of loans received from China.
