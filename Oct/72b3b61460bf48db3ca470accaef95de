South African Communist Party (SACP) General-Secretary Blade Nzimande says the party is preparing to make submissions to the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture. The commission will resume on 12 November with former Public Enterprises Barbara Hogan testifying. The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) says it has set its eye on Nzimande’s testimony. The party also accused former Finance Minister Nhlanhla Nene of being dishonest when he testified before the commission. Nene eventually apologised to South Africans and resigned for giving conflicting information about his interactions with the Guptas. However, speaking at the funeral of Eastern Cape Education MEC Mandla Makhupula, Nzimande said the SACP was ready. “Yes, the SACP is preparing itself to go and make its own presentation to the Zondo Commission. We are not as yet sure when we are going to be going there, but closer to the time, we’ll be able to give the relevant details as to who is going to go there to represent us.” Click below for more on the story:
