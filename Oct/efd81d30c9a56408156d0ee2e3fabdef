With the National Senior Certificate exams commencing in a week’s time, the Free State province is determined to lead the pack for three successive years. This has emerged at an education stakeholders meeting in Welkom. Parental support is said to be critical in getting the best out of the learners.  “We need our parents’ support in order to work hard in our studies, in order to push hard to succeed. Through education we can also help our parents out of poverty. The way they help us, we can pursue our dreams and improve lives at home,” says one of the matriculants who attended the meeting. Another leaner says; “I think our parents should play a much bigger role, because as students we tend to make wrong decisions and we need them to help us make good decisions. We also need them to encourage us to study more. I think they should also give us emotional support, because at this stage we are experiencing emotional strain.” Meanwhile, parents are ready to make the path smooth for their children’s future. They say their support will be of great influence. “Education now is very important and parents should support their children through all means, motivate them, for them to be successful,” says one of the parents. Another parent says;” We should support our children; our role is to encourage our children. If we don’t support them they will not have their future.”  Author-Makgala Masiteng
