The South African Municipal Workers Union at the Vhembe District Municipality, which invested R300 million to the VBS Mutual Bank, says they will host a mass action protest. Executive Mayor Florence Radzilani has allegedly been paid R300 thousand in commission for investing at VBS. She allegedly also demanded more than a R1 million saying R300 thousand was not enough. Radzilani has denied the allegations while she was addressing a church congregation on Sunday where her husband is an Apostle. Samwu spokesperson Timson Thililo says,”The municipal manger and the CFO must be suspended because it can’t be correct that the investigation is proceeding while they are there and we are saying to the ANC, we have been constantly raising that the executive mayor has put that municipality into disrepute.” In related developments, the ANC Youth League in Limpopo is calling on the two senior officials implicated in the VBS saga to recuse themselves from the party with immediate effect. ANC Provincial Treasurer Danny Msiza and Radzilani have been deeply implicated by the Reserve Bank report. The Youth League Spokesperson Nyiko Bembani says their call is consistent with the resolutions of the ANC 54th National Congress for people implicated in corrupt activities to recuse themselves from the party.
