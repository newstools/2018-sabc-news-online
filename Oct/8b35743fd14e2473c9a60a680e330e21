Lesotho’s facilitation team led by Justice Dikgang Moseneke has concluded a two day visit where they met various stakeholders, including Lesotho’s suspended Chief  Justice Nthomeng Majara. Moseneke had to make an urgent trip to Lesotho following a  somersault by Lesotho opposition to withdraw from the SADC Reforms process. He also met the government behind close doors, but it seems the facilitation team will have to double up its efforts, if they are to remain on schedule. “We had a full day of work today… we met leaders of opposition, we met government, we met parties outside government, and indeed we met with the Chief Justice, and we have dealt with a number of issues which are now at a very sensitive stage. We should be back next week, with a little more time to deal with these issues, and to advance the agenda of the national dialogue. There might be an adjustment to the dates. That’s what we are debating next week, but the roadmap is very much alive, we are still on track.” Meanwhile, the opposition blames the government for derailing the reforms process, by flouting the constitution. Mathibeli Mokhothi, leader of the opposition says the government must observe the rule of law. “The number of court orders that were issued against government, government must respect. The issue of Mohair Growers association, the issue of court orders issued against it in catering issues, pertaining hospitals catering… The issue of Chief Justice Nthomeng Majara, and the issue of court orders that were issued against government while it was trying to recall the diplomats….” SADC has outlined strict deadlines for Lesotho to complete reforms program by May, 2019. The SADC standby force is expected to leave Lesotho by the end of November, a situation that might raise new security challenges to the fragile mountain kingdom of Lesotho.
