The African National Congress (ANC) in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) has appealed to its members not to support those accused of being involved in politically-related crimes. The party says this is damaging its reputation. The call comes ahead of Thursday’s court appearance of six suspects charged with the murder of an ANC activist in Pietermaritzburg. KZN ANC Secretary, Mdumiseni Ntuli says, “they are urging their members to exercise restraint and not go to court to support suspect especially in matter as serious as murder.” The ANC says it’s seeking guidance from its National Executive Committee (NEC) on members who turn out at former President Jacob Zuma’s corruption court cases to support him. “Speaking about how the cases are different but that they are seeking advice from the NEC on how to handle the support of former president when he appears in court,” says Ntuli. Meanwhile following a decision by the ANC’s National Executive Committee, all remaining regional conferences have been postponed till next year. Task teams have been set up to oversee two of the province’s regions.
