The 61-year-old man accused of molesting a 10-year-old boy in Goromane near Hazyview, has been remanded in custody. He appeared in the Mkhuhlu Magistrate’s Court for a bail hearing. The matter was postponed for confirmation of his residential address among others. The locals want the suspect behind bars, they fear for the safety of the victim and also theirs as the community. Mkhuhlu resident, Laurencia Shakwane says:”We don’t want him to get bail. It doesn’t matter where he stays; we as a community at large are not safe.” The suspect has changed three legal representatives during his bail application. His new representative has called on the state to consider the rights of the accused. Defense lawyer Ephraim Khambako is adamant his client will respect his bail condition should it be considered. Khambako says: “We are not happy about the continuing postponements. I am concerned about the rights of the accused.  Whether he gets bail or not it is rested with the magistrate.”
