Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba lied to the Portfolio Committee about not approving a private terminal at OR Tambo International Airport for a company owned by the Oppenheimer family. That’s the testimony of the company’s Directors. The Oppenheimers appeared before the committee and shed light on the R150 million project. The Directors of Fireblade say the project was initiated in 2012. 17 government departments and agencies approved it. The Home Affairs Department gave it the green light on the 28th of January this year. Company Director Nicky Oppenheimer says it was in fact Gigaba who was “delighted” to inform them about the approval. He says he was later “astounded” when Gigaba denied this. The company has since won court action to enforce the deal but the Department now wants to take the matter to the Constitutional Court. Oppenheimer says Gigaba has since abandoned his argument about not approving the deal. Meanwhile, the meeting did not go without incident. Members of the Black First Land First disrupted the meeting momentarily before they were bundled out by bouncers. They were demanding the Oppenheimer private terminal be closed down.
