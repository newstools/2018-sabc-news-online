The South African Weather Service has warned that a cold front moving over the country may cause heavy rain or localised flooding in some places on Wednesday. The cold weather may also go hand-in-hand with snow falling over the southern and central parts of the Drakensberg. Forecaster Stacy Colborne says they are expecting a 30% chance of rain from Tuesday. “Tomorrow you can expect a 80% chance of showers and thunder showers over the eastern parts of KwaZulu-Natal. We can have some scattered showers and thunder showers over the rest of KwaZulu-Natal. We are expecting snow fall over the South Western high ground of KwaZulu-Natal. You can expect cold conditions over the province as well but the snow fall is is only over the South westerly high ground of KwaZulu-Natal which included Giants Castle, Underburg, Kokstad even up to Van Reenen.”
