Limpopo police say the church belonging to the husband of Vhembe Executive mayor, Florence Radzilani has been declared safe following reports of a bomb threat. Police were called to the Spirit Ambassadors Church at Tshirenzheni village, on Saturday night, after congregants noticed a suspicious object. Radzilani, who is also a senior ANC official in the province, has been implicated in the VBS Mutual Bank scandal, with an audit report finding that she influenced Vhembe municipality’s deposit into the bank. Police spokesperson Motlafela Mojapelo says: “The police at Siliom at Thohoyandou cluster have opened an inquiry following the bomb threat that was received Saturday night.” “Members of the bomb disposal unit were sent to the spirit ambassadors church in Nzhelele to investigate the matter and the place was later declared safe,” adds Mojapelo.
