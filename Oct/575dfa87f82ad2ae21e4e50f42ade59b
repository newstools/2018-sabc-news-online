President Cyril Ramaphosa has admitted that government will miss the National Development Plan target of reducing the country’s unemployment rate to around 6% by 2030. He was addressing government’s social partners – business and labour  at the Jobs Summit that began in Midrand Thursday afternoon. The President called for the two-day meeting to deal with the country’s stubbornly high unemployment rate, which is just over 27%. Ramaphosa concedes that the NDP target will be missed, unless something extra-ordinary is done. Meanwhile the Chairperson of the National Youth Development Agency Sifiso Mtsweni has urged the private sector to play its part in the employment of young people. Mtsweni says from the summit they expect nothing less but the prioritisation of the over 3,5 million unemployed young people.  Click video below:
