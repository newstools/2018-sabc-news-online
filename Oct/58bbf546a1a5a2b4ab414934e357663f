Demonstrators have gathered outside the Verulam Family Court, north of Durban, on Monday. This comes ahead of the formal bail application of 19 suspects in connection with the Verulam Mosque attack and a spate of bomb scares at various KwaZulu-Natal malls since May this year. The suspects will make their third court appearance on Monday. The 19 suspects have just arrived at the Verulam Magistrates Court. The police vehicle they arrived in was greeted by demonstrators, carrying placards that read “no terrorists”, “no places for religious extremism in South Africa.” The suspects who were arrested over a week ago are facing 14 charges which include murder and attempted murder. The media continues to be barred from court proceedings. Watch related videos:
