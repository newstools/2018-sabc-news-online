The Eastern Cape Department of Education has placed four provisional teachers and an administrator at St Matthews High School in Keiskammahoek to take over from suspended teachers implicated in a sex-for-marks scandal. The suspended male teachers are accused of demanding sex from girls in exchange for good marks and promotion to the next grade. Director for school administration Melikhaya Mancoko says the situation at St Matthews is under control. “As the  department we have moved with quick speed to make sure that the  teachers are available, the teachers are already in the classroom. They are there to make sure that teaching and learning resumes with speed and we have brought in an administrator whose main function is to ensure that there is tranquility and order in this institution”. However, Mancoko says investigations into the allegations of sexual assault are also at an advanced stage. “The labour relations, the risk management and legal services they are the ones driving this investigation, they are giving it the sensitivity it deserves, they promised that within 14 days we will be receiving a preliminary report regarding this.”
