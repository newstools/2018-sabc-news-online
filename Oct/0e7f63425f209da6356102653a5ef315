Gauteng police have opened a case of attempted murder following a shooting incident in Westbury on Tuesday Night. Police Minister Bheki Cele visited the area on Tuesday, and promised residents that the police’s Tactical Response Team will be deployed to restore calm. The community is fed up with drug related crimes and gangsterism. They protested after a woman and a 10-year-old girl were shot during a cross-fire between gang rivals. For many in Westbury, Police Minister Cele’s promise to deploy a Tactical Response Team to the area meant a step in the right direction, for the fight against drugs and crime. But  it was not to be just hours after Tuesday’s community meeting with the Minister that another shooting incident brought chaos and consternation to the community. The Community safety MEC Sizakele Nkosi-Malobane says the department can only do so much. It’s now up to the community to name and shame. A memorial service for the woman who was killed in the area last week will be held on Wednesday evening. Despite the visit from the Minister Cele and additional police deployment in the area, residents have threatened to continue their shutdown, until police start tackling gangsterism and drugs in the area.
