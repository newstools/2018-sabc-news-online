The trial of controversial pastor, Timothy Omotoso, will resume in the High Court in Port Elizabeth on Thursday. The case was postponed to give the defence time to prepare its argument for an appeal. This after the presiding judge, Mandela Makaula refused to recuse himself from the case, following the defence’s request. Omotoso and his co-accused are facing 97 sex-related charges. On Monday, defence advocate Peter Daubermann told the court that Omotoso and his co-accused believed that they were not receiving a fair trial and that the judge is biased. Daubermann listed several incidents, accusing the judge of having aligned himself with Zondi’s case. However, Judge Makaula dismissed the application, saying it had no merit. Daubermann indicated they would apply for leave to appeal his decision. The defence was granted time to prepare arguments for a possible appeal in the Supreme Court of Appeal. Watch related videos:
