The Social Development Department has agreed to suspend the Social Security Agency (Sassa) biometric system.Â This has emerged after a crucial meeting in Johannesburg on Wednesday. The meeting was held to resolve the Sassa strike and avert a social grant payment crisis. Minister Susan Shabangu was meeting striking workers union Nehawu and senior Sassa officials. Sassa workers began with their national strike action earlier on Wednesday. They were protesting over a number of issues including the the biometric system. They say the biometric enrolment for beneficiaries is a new function that workers were not consulted on and that the employer implemented it unilaterally.
