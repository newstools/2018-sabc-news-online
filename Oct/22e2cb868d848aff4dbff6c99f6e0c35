Fees Must Fall activist and former Wits University SRC President Mcebo Dlamini has accused former head of the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA), Shaun Abrahams of being part of a political conspiracy behind his arrest. Dlamini appeared before the Johannesburg Magistrate’s Court on Friday where his pre-trial was postponed to April next year. “As I have always been saying the state does not have a case against me,” says Dlamini. Despite a cloud of legal uncertainty hanging over his head, Dlamini says he is ready to campaign for the ANC Youth League presidential race if he is nominated. He is one of several Fees Must Fall activists who descended on the Union Buildings asking for a presidential pardon. His attempts to also have his case thrown out of court have been dealt a blow.
