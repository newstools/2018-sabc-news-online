The disbanded African National Congress (ANC) Nelson Mandela Bay Regional Executive Committee (REC) is refusing to step down, saying they are waiting for the ANC NEC to respond to their letter. The regional structure was disbanded by the Provincial Executive Committee due to poor performance on Tuesday. The REC addressed the media in Port Elizabeth on Wednesday. According to Provincial Secretary Lulama Ngcukaitobi the region failed to reach the 70% threshold target of branches in good standing, but only managed 60%. Ngcukaitobi adds that preparations for 2019’s general elections in the region are slow. The REC refutes these allegations, saying they have 70% of branches in good standing and preparations for elections are at an advanced stage. Outgoing Acting Chairperson Phumzile Tshuni says the disbandment of the REC will destabilise the region ahead of the elections. “We have written a letter to the National Executive Committee of the ANC to intervene to our REC being dissolved until such a time the NEC resolved the matte. Our REC is going nowhere. There will also be no announcement of the RTT in the Metro as we do not recognize any disbandment as this Regional Executive Committee. We are still operating even now.” Attempts to get a comment from the PEC were unsuccessful.
