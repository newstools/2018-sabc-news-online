Police in KwaZulu-Natal are hot on the heels of two suspects believed to be involved in selling human body parts. The suspects fled the scene after the car they were travelling in was found with body parts. The third suspect was arrested and appeared at the Ramsgate Magistrateâ€™s court in Margate on the KwaZulu-Natal south coast. During his appearance, it emanated that the 34-year-old male suspect was out on bail for a previous case of culpable homicide that happened in 2015. Police say the suspect admitted to having dug up two graves in the Margate area to remove body parts with the aim of selling them to traditional healers. It is alleged that the suspects were making calls around the Manguzi area, soliciting buyers for the body parts for around R4000. Police say they are investigating if the suspects are not linked to other cases of selling human body parts. The suspected human tissue has been taken for DNA analysis to determine if they come from different people. The case has been postponed to 16 October for further consultation and the suspect will remain in custody.
