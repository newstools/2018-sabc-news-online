Camps have been set up in various schools in the Mopani area to keep learners focused for the duration of their final examinations. The initiative aims to improve poor matric results in rural schools in Limpopo. Last year, the province got 65% matric pass rate. In pursuit of good results for a better future, pupils have all come together, to what is commonly known as study camps. They bath, eat and sleep there, under the watch of teachers and guardians. The aim is to properly prepare for the matric examinations. Students have extra time to catch up for the much anticipated exams. Pupils like Vuntshwa Ntimane believe that their sacrifices will bear fruits: “It is hard being away from home but I believe the sacrifice is worth it.” Another learner Mpimo Mthombeni says: “I believe that I will do well because we’re getting all the necessary support from teachers and parents.” Famandha High School was the first to set up a camp around Giyani. Three years running, and the plan seem to be yielding positive results. Teacher Joyce Shingange explains that they have volunteered to assist in the evening, with a hope of scoring hundred percent pass rate. “I feel good to be part of the camp after asked to assist by parents and I think all my students will surely pass.” The school has seen an increase of matric pass rate since the inception of the camps. Pupils are confident that they are ready for their first paper to be written on Tuesday.
