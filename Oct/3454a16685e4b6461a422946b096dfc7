The provincial official funeral for Eastern Cape Education MEC, Mandla Makupula, is expected to be held at the Arbotsford Christian Church in East London on Saturday morning. Makupula died on Monday last week at an East London hospital after a long illness. Makupula was the longest serving Education MEC in the province, having served from 2010 to the time of his death. He was also a member of the provincial legislature from 1999, and before that he served on several structures in the ANC. Provincial government spokesperson, Sonwabo Mbananga, says there will be buses in Mdantsane to take family members and friends to Abortsford. “The provincial government has made all the necessary preparation towards the holding of the provincial official state funeral for the late Eastern Cape education MEC, honourable Mandla Makupula. The preparations are such that the funeral service, the program will reflect the stature of the declaration by the honourable president, as per the policy that governs and regulates state funerals.”
