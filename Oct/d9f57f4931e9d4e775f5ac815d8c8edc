A delegations of African Liberation movements delivered messages of support and solidarity to the people of Western Sahara. They reiterated that Africa will not be free, until the last of its colonies, Western Sahara, was liberated, free and independent. Representatives of various African Liberation movements met this week in Tindouf in Algeria in solidarity with the people of the Saharawi Republic also known as Western Sahara. During a visit to the National Liberation Museum in Rubani, where refugees from Saharawi live, the call for the decolonisation, liberation and independence of Africa’s remaining colony was echoed by Zimbabwe’s former Foreign Affairs minister Simbarashe Mumbengegwi.
