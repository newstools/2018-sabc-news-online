The inquiry into the process of the naturalisation of the Gupta family resumes on Tuesday at Parliament’s Portfolio Committee on Home Affairs. Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba is expected to be among the witnesses giving evidence in the proceedings. The committee is investigating the process by which the Guptas were granted naturalisation during Gigaba’s previous tenure at Home Affairs between 2014 and early 2017. Former Director General Mkhuseli Apleni previously gave evidence before the committee and was criticised by MPs for not doing due diligence when approving the naturalisation of the wealthy business family, who have subsequently been deeply implicated in state capture.
