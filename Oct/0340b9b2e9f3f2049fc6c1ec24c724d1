Flooding has been reported in many parts of Pretoria after a severe thunderstorm and downpours Saturday afternoon.  Many pictures have been posed on social  media of cars floating in deep water along flooded streets.  Roads near Iscor in the west of the city have been swamped. At the Loftus Versfeld rugby stadium in the east of the city, the Currie Cup match between the Blue Bulls and Western Province was abandoned at half-time because of the extreme weather – a  very rare occurrence in the sport.  No casualties have been reported from the floods at this point.
