Eighty-seven protesters, who were arrested for public violence in Mahlatswetsa and Excelsior, will remain in custody until their next court appearance on Monday. The protesters appeared at the Excelsior Magistrate Court on Wednesday and the case was postponed to October 22, 2018 for bail application. Residents were protesting against lack of housing and unemployment in the area. They have also accused police of heavy handedness in defusing tensions during violent protests. Free State Premier Sisi Ntombela and mayor Mamsy Tsuene visited the area and told the protesters that the contractor will start building the houses on Monday. Police spokesperson Martin Xuma says they will continue to monitor the situation. He says: “The situation is currently calm in Excelsior and police are continuing with patrols to make sure that things are under control around Mahlatswetsa and Excelsior.”
