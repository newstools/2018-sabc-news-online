The SABC says retrenching 981 permanent employees and not renewing the contracts of 1200 freelancers would result in a saving of R440 million per annum. The public broadcaster has issued a notice to all its employees informing them of its intention to embark on retrenchments as a cost-saving measure. Earlier this month, the process was halted following the joint consensus seeking a meeting with organised labour. It’s envisaged that the restructuring will affect all employees at all levels in the SABC. Jonathan Thekiso is the SABC’s Group Executive for Human Resources says: “We have a wage bill currently that’s sitting at R3.1 billion on revenue of R7.2 billion. The wage bill is almost half the revenue that the SABC is generating right now. So I don’t think there’s any organisation that wants to go through section 189. The organisation is now at a point where it’s left with no other alternative but to start the consultation process with organised labour.” WATCH RELATED VIDEO:
