Limpopo government has bemoaned what it calls lack of cooperation from municipal managers who invested money with VBS Mutual Bank. The provincial government is conducting a forensic investigation into one of the country’s largest financial scandals. There is no end in sight in the VBS saga. About 10 municipalities in the province deposited a combined R1 billion into VBS. Vhembe District Municipality invested more than R300 million with the Mutual Bank. The government says the information on why the money was invested has not been forthcoming Limpopo Government Spokesperson Phuthi Seloba says, “Why a municipality like Collins Chabane, which has been formed recently and has very few executives, can’t come with the information concerning what really happened when the money was deposited?” Seloba says those who are implicated in the VBS scandal must voluntarily resign from the positions. “People who are implicated should not continue to occupy their positions while the investigations on the matter continue.” Meanwhile, a new structure named Vuwani Demarcation Task Team has been formed. The team is advocating for the formation of a fifth municipality in Vhembe to resolve the Vuwani impasse.
