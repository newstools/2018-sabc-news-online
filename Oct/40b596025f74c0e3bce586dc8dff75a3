A third suspect arrested for his involvement in the killing of Westbury mother Heather Peterson has appeared briefly in court. The 32-year-old Jermaine Davids was arrested in Krugersdorp on Sunday following a joint intelligence operation.Â His case will be combined with two other suspects for a bail application on Wednesday. The 48-year-old Peterson died about three weeks after being caught in gang crossfire. Her 10-year-old niece was also injured in the shooting. Her killing sparked violent anti-drug protests in the area prompting the deployment of the Tactical Response Team. Seven other suspects including two policemen from the Sophiatown Police Station have also been arrested for the murder of a 21-year-old Westbury resident. Their cases will also be heard this week.
