Cope leader Mosiuoa Lekota has described the death of the ANC stalwart and retired diplomat Moss Chikane as a significant loss for the country. Chikane died at the age of 69 on Wednesday night.  The family says Chikane had been unwell for some time. Chikane played a prominent role in the liberation struggle and was one of the key leaders of the United Democratic Front (UDF) and was convicted of treason along with Popo Molefe and Lekota in 1988. Lekota says he worked very closely with Chikane. “We worked with Moss from the beginning of the 80s. In 1983, when we started the moves to organise for UDF in order to oppose PW Botha’s then new deal proposal of the Tricameral Parliament and the black local authority’s acts. That move was a major move to frustrate the apartheid regime agenda and impress upon the regime that inequality was unacceptable to the people.” Read EFF’s condolence statement (tweet) below:
