The South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) in Limpopo has distanced itself from people who are making social grant cash payments in the villages across the province. On Tuesday SABC News visited Ndengeza and Rivala villages outside Giyani where some grant beneficiaries received their cash payments. Many of the beneficiaries told SABC News that they had the full payment due to them. Sassa Limpopo Regional Manager, Matshidiso Mamabolo says Sassa and the South African Post Office will only start visiting villages for this month’s cash payments next Monday. “We as Sassa and SAPO have not been to any pay points. Our plan going forward the first week of the month we will only be concentrating on the Post Offices which are 135 in the province so whoever got the money at the pay point as we speak. That person was not sent by us. We will only be visiting pay points starting from the 8th. We are reliably informed that there are people driving around, paying people half payments”. However, Mamabolo says they are investigating to find out who is making the payments. “It will be very difficult for me to say who is responsible for this whole thing. At the moment it is a sub-judice matter and I would not be able to say this is where we are or this is how far we are but we have just been informed of this thing and definitely the necessary steps with be taken to deal with this kind of issue”.
