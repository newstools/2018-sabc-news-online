The Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (Outa) in a statement said it was not too late for the government to correct its wrong decision on e-tolls. The civil action and anti e-toll group released the statement after Finance Minister Tito Mboweni made his policy statement on Wednesday saying  that government was committed to the user-pay principle. The organisation sounded the death knell of Gauteng’s e-tolls after the province’s Premier David Makhura conceded that the system was simply not working. Outa chairperson Wayne Duvenhage said: “It’s the most expensive, biggest failure of e-tolling systems in the world, where the average collection cost is below ten percent. The Gauteng one is over 90 percent and that’s due to the complete defiance by the public.”
