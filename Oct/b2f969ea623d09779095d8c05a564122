Residents of Westbury west of Johannesburg are out in the streets for another day of protests. The situation is calm but tense. On Friday the area was brought to a standstill as residents took to the streets to protest against gangsterism, drugs and crime. The protest was sparked by the death of a woman who was shot and killed after being caught in crossfire during suspected gang related violence.   The woman’s daughter was critically wounded. They marched to the Sophiatown Police Station, demanding action against crime. Three people were injured when police used teargas and fired rubber bullets to disperse the crowd during the violent protest. Gauteng Community Safety MEC, Sizakele Nkosi-Malobane addressed the community later on Friday. When police tried to disperse the protesting crowd outside the Sophiatown police station, three people, two of them elderly women, were injured after they were hit by rubber bullets.
