The VhaVenda King Toni Mphephu-Ramabulana says he was not aware that some gifts that he received were proceeds of corruption at VBS Mutual Bank. Ramabulana has offered to pay back any money that the Reserve Bank report says was taken illegally from VBS Mutual Bank. The Reserve bank’s “Great Bank Heist’ report says the king received 17.7 million-rand from VBS in gratuity. Ramabulana’s Spokesperson Makonde Mathivha says the king is pained by the loss incurred by VBS’s clients. “He was not aware that these resources that were given to him voluntarily by individuals and entities that are mentioned in the report were tainted.” “As a result of that with the benefit of hindsight now that he is aware, he will be assisted by the relevant authorities to understand the breakdown of whatever happened here.” “He will be prepared to get into agreements with those authorities so that there could be repayments of those monies paid to him but could be sourced from corrupt activities.” Related video click below:
