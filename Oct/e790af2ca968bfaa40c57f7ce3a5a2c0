There was high drama at the Port Elizabeth High Court on Tuesday, where the human trafficking trial of Pastor Timothy Omotoso is underway. A woman was forcefully removed from the court premises by security, after she misrepresented herself as part of Omotoso’s security detail. She is actually a member of Omotoso’s church, the Jesus Dominion International Church. She was trying to enter the court when she was approached by the Hawks and police. Security measures at the court house have been very tight since the trial started Monday. The first witness could possibly take the stand later Tuesday.
