Some HIV-positive patients in Free State clinics claim they haven’t been able to receive medication for more than four months. A 51-year-old woman who has been HIV-positive for the past 11 years, Elisa Makhanya, collects her medication every month. Recently she has not been able to do so because the clinics have run out. “For years I have been receiving medication here and these ARVs have been working wonders but now since we are told by the clinic staff that they have ran out of stock we are going to get sick again,” says Makhanya. Other HIV-positive patients are also concerned. Sello Mkhaliphi, Positive Action Campaign Secretary says: “We are sitting with shortage of three and other pills. Where people are given medication meant for babies its strength is not enough.” Authorities have refuted patients’ claims. Mondli Mvambi, Free State Health Department spokesperson says: “We want to assure our viewers as a province we have not run out of money. We have not been lethargic in terms of getting supply on time; we have done everything possible.” The Free State Health Department says it has rationalised the distribution of drugs so that people can have a constant supply of medication. But this doesn’t seem to be the case for some HIV-positive patients who are turned away month after month because clinics say they’ve run out of the drugs.
