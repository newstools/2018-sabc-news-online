The Tshwane Emergency Services have resumed their search for two bodies in Pretoria’s Apies River. This follows heavy rain which has claimed at least 10 lives in the country’s interior. A passer-by reported seeing the bodies of two people who’d apparently drowned in the flooding river.  At the weekend, eight people were killed in two separate crashes in Mpumalanga both in the Mbombela-Barberton area, which authorities blamed on the wet weather. Tshwane Emergency Services spokesperson Johan Pieterse says they will search for the bodies throughout the day. “We’ve been searching for about 5 hours on the river banks, we could not put our personnel and the rescue workers inside the water the flow and current of the water was just too strong. The search was called off yesterday afternoon. We will resume this morning and they will continue throughout the day until something is found or until they make a decision that they can’t find anything.”
