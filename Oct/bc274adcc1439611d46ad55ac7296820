Civil society groups are calling on the ANC’s National Executive Committee to overturn the party’s Gauteng PEC’s decision and fire Brian Hlongwa and Qedani Mahlangu. Corruption Watch, Treatment Action Campaign and Section27 have expressed concerns at the Gauteng ANC PEC’s rejection of the recommendation of the provincial integrity committee that Mahlangu and Hlongwa’s membership in the ANC and its structure be suspended. The ANC’s Gauteng Integrity Committee has also recommended that Hlongwa, Mahlangu and former Emfuleni mayor Simon Mofokeng not hold any public office positions. It says it will take its cue on the matter from the NEC which is expected to discuss the issue at its meeting this weekend. Secretary General of the Treatment Action Campaign, Anele Yawa says,”Brian Hlongwa is still a member of the Gauteng Legislature. He only stepped down as the chief whip. It means he will continue to get a salary from tax payers money, the same taxpayers that he robbed of money. So we thought the governing party is going to man up and stop protecting the interest of the individual at the expense of the majority of the people. And be able to say Brian Hlongwa step aside, Qedani Mahlangu step aside.”
