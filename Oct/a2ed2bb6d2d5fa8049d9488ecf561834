Dozens of African National Congress (ANC) and Democratic Alliance (DA) supporters are singing outside the Ekurhuleni council chambers east of Johannesburg ahead of the motion of no confidence in the city’s mayor, Mzwandile Masina. The DA says it will table the motion because Masina has failed the city’s residents. Both the DA and ANC supporters are confident that their parties will emerge victorious after the motion on Thursday. Wearing their party’s regalia they are singing outside the council chambers. ANC supporters are holding placards saying “Hands off Masina” while DA members placards state “He must go”.    There’s a strong police presence and several streets around the Civic Centre have been closed off to traffic.
