Democratic Alliance (DA) leader, Mmusi Maimane, has retracted a statement he made in which he claimed that the five DA councillors who resigned from the City of Cape Town on Thursday, were implicated in tender irregularities and maladministration in the Bowman Gilfillan report. The City commissioned the report to investigate corruption. Shaun August, Suzette Little, Thulani Stemele, Gregg Barnardo and Siya Mamkeli all resigned as DA councillors, citing issues of racism within the party as the reason for their resignations. The councillors had given Maimane until 6pm on Monday to retract the statement or face legal action. Maimaneâ€™s spokesperson, Graham Charters says the statement has since been withdrawn. He says Maimane is now taking legal advice on the matter.  Watch related video below:
