Eskom must supply electricity to people who do not have the finances to pay for it. This according to Johannesburg’s ANC spokesperson Jolidee Matongo. He says the party, along with alliance partners SANCO, SACP, COSATU will march to various government offices in Johannesburg on Friday to demand better service delivery to residents of metros. Matongo says the march which will start at Mary Fitzgerald Square in Newtown will proceed to the offices of Johannesburg mayor Herman Mashaba and Gauteng premier David Makhura as well as Eskom offices in Braamfontein. He says the demand for free electricity is for areas such as Ivory park, Soweto and Orange farm. “We find Eskom just going in and cutting electricity for the elderly who are unable to pay. We are calling on Eskom to also implement an indigent policy, where the poor who can’t afford can be given free electricity. Eskom is not handling the matter properly. Power outages lasting over seven days. There is no constant supply of electricity to many of our residents.”
