Acting SARS commissioner Mark Kingon says the SARS E-filing system is not on the verge of collapse. However, if improvements are not carried out in the near future it will pose a challenge. Kingon was appearing before the SARS commission of inquiry in Pretoria on Friday. Kingon says measures are currently in place to manage the risk.  In a statement released earlier this week, SARS said that testimony by SARS executives led to wide spread concern that the E-filing system is on the verge of collapse, however this is incorrect. Kingon is appearing before the SARS commission of inquiry underway in Pretoria. Kingon says a sense of fear and distrust still haunts the organisation. He says he has moved to remove some of the cameras which were installed throughout the SARS headquarters. SARS employees, who have previously appeared before the commission, testified about surveillance equipment installed on computers, on printers and even up in the trees at the revenue services headquarters. Kingon apolgises for SARS wrongdoings Earlier, Kingon offered an apology to South Africans, and to President Cyril Ramaphosa for the failures that had happened at the revenue services. The Commission has adjourned until Tuesday next week and Judge Robert Nugent says he will soon start working on his final report. Kingon said the Sikhakhane report which made findings in the so called rogue unit, exposed confidential taxpayer information and ruined people’s lives and careers. He said the internal investigations which have been instituted against current and former SARS employees were mischievous. The Commission is expected to submit its final report in December.
