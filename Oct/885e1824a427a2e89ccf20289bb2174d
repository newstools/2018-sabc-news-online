Brazil’s far-right presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro saw his sizeable lead narrow slightly over leftist rival Fernando Haddad in a new Ibope election poll published on Tuesday, looking at voter intentions for Sunday’s run-off vote. The poll showed Bolsonaro winning 57 percent of valid votes to Haddad’s 43 percent, compared to 59 percent for Bolsonaro and 41 percent for Haddad in Ibope’s previous survey last week. The new numbers are in line with other polls that show Bolsonaro taking between 57 percent and 60 percent of the votes.
