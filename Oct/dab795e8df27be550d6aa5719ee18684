It’s not clear when Moody’s will publish its next review of South Africa’s debt, after the ratings agency delayed its announcement, which was widely expected on Friday. Moody’s did not give any reason for the delay or the next scheduled release date. Moody’s currently rates South Africa’s foreign and local currency debt at its lowest investment grade rung of Baa3, with a stable outlook. An analyst at Intellidex, Peter Attard Montalto says they expect Moody’s to keep South Africa’s ratings unchanged for the rest of the year and wait for the country’s budget next year before making a decision.
