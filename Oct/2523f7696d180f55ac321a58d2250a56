A 59-year-old woman who invested R450 000 at VBS says law-enforcement entities must speed up the process to recoup the money from people who looted the bank. Elisa Mudau of Tshiulungoma village outside Thohoyandou received only R100 000 from her investment. A number of politicians and municipal officials are implicated in the South African Reserve Bank report on the downfall of VBS Mutual Bank. Mudau says her wish is to get an opportunity to explain her frustration to President Cyril Ramaphosa. She says: “They should recoup all the money looted by now or attach the assets of those involved in the looting. I want to see President Ramaphosa because they are playing with us. Investigations are conducted when you don’t know the culprit but now you know the culprits but still say you are doing investigations. Those people must just bring back the money and be disciplined later because once they are arrested the money will not be recovered.” Mudau is strugging to pay tuition fees for her children since VBS was put under curatorship. She says she does not even go to Thohoyandou anymore because it is too painful for her to see the VBS building. Related Video
