Western Cape Minister of Community Safety, Dan Plato says there are serious questions that need to be asked regarding Police Minister Bheki Celeâ€™s recent announcement about the deployment of a new Anti-Gang Unit. The unit, consisting of 95 police members, will be launched on the Cape Flats next month. Plato says the Minister of Police should give his assurance that this unit is not another fly-by-night gimmick. Another issue Plato raised is the question of how effective 95 officers could be in tackling the scale of the gangs, guns and drugs problem in the Western Cape. A small number of members from the Anti-Gang Unit have already been deployed to crime hotspots on the Cape Flats. Cele announced the establishment of an Anti Gang Unit on Monday in Hanover Park.
