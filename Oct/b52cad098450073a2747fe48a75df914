Home Affairs Minister, Malusi Gigaba says the launch of the state of the art Refugee Reception Centre for new asylum applicants, will assist in rooting out corruption that hinders services towards refugees in the Nelson Mandela Bay Metro. He says his department had to comply with the court order granted in 2011, to show that government respects the Constitution, after pressure from the Refugees Associations to close down its offices. Gigaba says corrupt officials were used by syndicates to bring illegal immigration that undermined democracy and promoted crime in South Africa. The state of the art facilities will deal with challenges facing refugee reception centres such as long queues. Gigaba opened the facilities to deal with people that have legitimate claims. Refugees will be able to view what is being typed on their documents, via surveillance cameras to reduce syndicate crimes. Long queues made it difficult for Home Affairs officials to deal with the influx of refugees. Gigaba says:” This type of office brings on board an up-to-date technology and very advanced deployment of human resources which will assist to fast-track services.” The Somali Association of South Africa has welcomed this ground breaking initiative. Regional director of Somali SA Dino Jilley says:”Words cannot express how happy we are especially people of PE and surrounding areas. This is one of the biggest days and we like to thank South African government for providing service delivery, especially the minister of Home Affairs. ” The centre will be operational from Monday.
