An emotional first state witness and alleged rape victim, Cheryl Zondi has given the High Court in Port Elizabeth details of how she escaped from pastor Timothy Omotoso’s house in Durban. She’s been responding to further questions by defence lawyer Advocate Peter Dauberman in the Eastern Cape. Zondi told the court she decided to escape as she was fed up with pleasing the Nigerian pastor. It is her third day of gruelling cross examination by defence lawyer Advocate Peter Dauberman. Zondi said she had enough of pleasing Omotoso sexually, could not hide her feelings longer and was continuously harassed and confronted by him. She broke down when she described how she called her aunt who organised a cab. She threw her bag through a window, leaving a lot of clothes behind and later escaped from the mission house while all were sleeping and got into the cab. Meanwhile, provincial chairperson of the ANC Women’s League in the Eastern Cape, Bukiwe Fanta, says they are not happy with the way the victim is being cross examined. She says: “I thank God I am sitting here and for this powerful young women who managed to break the ice and be strong. The line of questioning of the defence is terrible and its insensitive for a victim. It is secondary victimisation and it is out of line.”
