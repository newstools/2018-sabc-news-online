South Africans will know by the end of January next year, the outcome of government’s investigation into possible capping of the petrol price. Energy Minister, Jeff Radebe, says further consultations are taking place with the relevant stakeholders on the matter. Radebe expects a report on the investigation in the next three months. Answering oral questions in the National Assembly, the minister was asked if the investigation includes exploring ways to avoid increases in the Road Accident Fund, which is financed by a fuel levy. “The issue of Road Accident Fund is not right now part of the study because it has a very critical impact on fiscus so those discussions will be parallel to the process because we don’t want to impact on fiscal consolidation as emphasised also by the minister of finance during the mini budget.”
