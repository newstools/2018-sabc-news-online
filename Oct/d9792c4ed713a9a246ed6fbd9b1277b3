Mandela Makaula, the Judge presiding over the Timothy Omotoso trial has ordered defence lawyer, Peter Daubbermann to tone down, after he told the court that there are surprises arising in the case. This after Cheryl Zondi’s testimony led to the prosecutor Nceba Ntelwa asking to make amendments to the charge sheet and extend the period of the offence. Daubermann advised the suspects on Tuesday not to plead, saying the charge sheet did not supply sufficient details to allow for an answer. He also said that the unavailability of details pertaining to times and places made it hard for him to defend the accused. The court has been adjourned, as Daubermann negotiates a postponement with the judge. Emotions were high at the Port Elizabeth High Court as Cheryl  Zondi was testifying about how Nigerian Pastor Timothy Omotoso ordered her to join him in bed, while fondling himself. The 22-year-old woman says she was confused when the pastor asked her if she has a love life, as she was 14 at the time. About 49 witnesses are expected to take a stand during this trial. Cheryl Zondi says this incident happened during bedtime at Omotoso’s house in Durban, when she travelled for a church meeting. She alleges that she was 14 when Omotoso ordered her to take off her clothes, which she obeyed. Zondi alleges that Omotoso noticed how inexperienced she was, and led her by climbing on top, and sexually assaulted her.
