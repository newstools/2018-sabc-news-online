The man who was arrested and charged with killing former African National Congress Youth League (ANCYL) Secretary General Sindiso Magaqa appeared briefly in the Umzimkhulu Magistrateâ€™s Court in southern KwaZulu-Natal. Sibusiso Ncengwa, 30, was arrested in September after Police Minister Bheki Cele appointed a special task team of the Hawks to investigate political killings in the province. Magaqa and two other councillors were attacked in July last year. Magaqa died in hospital two months later. Ncengwa is facing charges of murder and attempted murder and had previously abandoned his bail application. The case has been postponed to January 14, 2019 for the state to finalise the indictment.
