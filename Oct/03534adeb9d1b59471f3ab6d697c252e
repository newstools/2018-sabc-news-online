Disgruntled members of the Free State African National Congress say the current provincial executive committee is illegally constituted and dividing the party. They are saying they have filed court papers, to show that they don’t recognise the PEC. “There are members of the that illegal PEC who have approached individual members of the ANC, the individuals say they recognise them to want them to serve in the PEC. But the majority of the members of the ANC in the Free State don’t recognise the current PEC,” says spokesperson for the disgruntled members, Monnapule Ntamo. Click related video:
