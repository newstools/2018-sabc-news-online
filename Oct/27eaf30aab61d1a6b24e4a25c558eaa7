Cape Town Mayor, Patricia de Lille, says the Democratic Alliance (DA) is damaging its own brand with what she calls a continuing smear campaign against her. This after it emerged that she may be criminally charged for corruption alleged in forensic reports commissioned by the DA. The party reached an agreement with De Lille two months ago for her to vacate her position after more than a year of tension between them. Five DA members in Cape Town resigned this week in solidarity with De Lille. She’s confirmed that she’s seeking legal advice whether to resign at the end of the month. She says: “I am consulting with my lawyers and unfortunately it is back to court before Wednesday. My name has become synonymous with tackling corruption in this country. There are people in the DA that are hell-bent on smearing my name. They have lost every single case against me so far and this new one is just another attempt for them to smear my name which is at the expense of major brand damage to the DA.” Related Video
