Police have seized more than 80 bags of abalone worth an estimated amount of R1, 3 million. Two people have been arrested in possession of Abalone in Tierpoort on the N1 outside Bloemfontein. Illegal abalone fishing along South African shores has been of great concern for authorities. According to the law, people are not allowed to fish or collect abalone without a permit. It is one of the most protected species. Police K9 unit was doing routine patrol on N1 when they saw a suspicious minibus taxi. Police Spokesperson Mahlomola Kareli says when they approached two suspects fled, but were later arrested. “When they arrived at the garage, the two people that were in the vehicle opened doors and just fled. Our police officials ran after them until they caught them and brought them back to the Kombi. On arrival at the combi, they discovered that inside the combi there is plastic bags full of abalone,” says Kareli. The two suspects, aged 32 and 33, will face charges of being in possession of abalone illegally. The minibus taxi was reportedly from Western Cape to Gauteng.
