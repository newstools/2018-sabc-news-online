Several MyCiti bus routes remain suspended in Cape Town as a strike by hundreds of workers enters its second day.  MyCiti workers embarked on a strike on Monday demanding among others, better wages and working conditions and want the City of Cape Town to intervene by in-sourcing them. The staff, including bus drivers, cleaners and security guards, work for companies which the City uses to operate its MyCiti bus routes. Mayoral Committee Member for Transport Brett Herron says he is concerned about the disruption of the bus service. Herron, “All I can do is to apologise to our commuters. We have 75 000 passenger trips a day that are made in a week on the MyCiti service and there are several thousand passengers who had their day inconvenienced by this and I’m hoping that the employers and employees can find each other and get the service back on track.” Meanwhile, the two companies contracted by the City of Cape Town to operate MyCiti bus services have given an ulitmatum to striking workers to return to work or face disciplinary action. Companies, TBRT and Exellerate Services have warned that the strike is unprotected, however the workers say they will continue with the strike until their demands are met.
