The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) in KwaZulu-Natal has finally elected its provincial leadership after being without it for almost three years. The previous provincial leadership was disbanded in 2016 due to infighting among party members. During the provincial conference held in Pietermaritzburg, the party caucus leader in the KwaZulu-Natal legislature Vusi Khoza was elected provincial chairperson. Khoza outlines their immediate priorities. “The first thing on the agenda will be that there is an EFF in every region, in all eleven regions in the province. So our next focus would be to begin immediately with preparations for the elections for 2019 so that by the time everyone starts focusing on elections, at least we are miles ahead.”
