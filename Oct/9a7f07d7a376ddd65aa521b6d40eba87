KwaZulu-Natal African National Congress (ANC) deputy chairperson Mike Mabuyakhulu and 15 others are expected back in the Durban Commercial Crimes Court on Tuesday in connection with corruption worth R28 million linked to the failed North Sea Jazz Festival in 2012. The crimes are alleged to have occurred while Mabuyakhulu was the Economic Development MEC in the province. The state is expected to respond to the application brought by KwaZulu-Natal ANC deputy chair Mabuyakhulu to have his six charges prosecuted separately from the rest of his co-accused. In total there are over 70 charges totalling to the R28 million listed in the charge sheet. The state is alleging that Mabuyakhulu received a kick back of some R300 000 after government paid for the failed North Sea Jazz Festival in 2012. During his last court appearance Mabuyakhulu appeared in court without the support of ANC members.
