The newly formed Western Cape United Safety Front is leading a demonstration to Parliament, in Cape Town to ask government to act more decisively against gang violence. Various community based organisations are marching behind the banner of the Western Cape United Safety Front, and include child rights groups, as well as youth movements. They plan to hand over copies of a memorandum asking authorities to act against gang violence to both national and provincial government. The march comes in as protests in Westbury in Johannesburg rage on where the community is protesting against gang violence and drugs. The protest in Westbury and neighbouring townships was sparked by the fatal shooting of a woman where her daughter was seriously wounded in an alleged gang shootout. The City of Cape Town has deployed police in great numbers to monitor the march. The march in Cape Town is supported by trade union federation Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) in the province.
