Educators say communities should play a decisive role in curbing violence at schools. Videos depicting learners attacking educators have been going viral on various social media platforms. The concerns emerge as the world celebrates International Teachers’ Day. Educators from Bainsvlei Combined school believe that the lack of support from stakeholders is massively contributing to the school violence. Teachers’ unions are also concerned and are calling for all stakeholders to join hands to save the profession. Free State SADTU secretary Mokholoane Moloi says parents and the community as key role players of the school should do some work to deal with the challenge of discipline. He says: “We believe it will be more efficient and effective if there is collaboration from the Social Development, police department, community leaders and even the church because the problem is bigger than just in schools.
