The SABC has reiterated that the total current salaries of Executive Directors have been significantly reduced. The public broadcaster further says details of the pay of Chief Operations Officer, Chris Maroleng and others will be contained in the 2018-2019 annual results. In a statement the SABC says it has always compiled with the requirement to provide information of the remuneration of executives in audited statements in terms of the companies Act. However it says its not obligated to provide such information outside of its audited annual financial statements. The Democratic Alliance (DA) earlier challenged the SABC to reveal whether Maroleng was receiving the same R2.7 million annual salary that was paid to the previous COO, Hlaudi Motsoeneng. Motsoeneng was fired by the SABC last year following a disciplinary hearing for bringing the SABC into disrepute â€“ among other things. READ STATEMENT BELOW:
