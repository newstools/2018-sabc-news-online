The South  African Social Security Agency (Sassa) has launched an investigation into payments of social grants at cash payment points in Limpopo and the Free Sate. SABC News has visited several villages in the Giyani area of Limpopo where unbranded cash vans with mobile ATMs were paying Sassa beneficiaries. Some beneficiaries allege that three withdrawals were made for each beneficiary allegedly to maximise bank charges. Other beneficiaries allege that they did not get the full amount that is due to them. Sassa’s spokesperson Paseka Letsatsi says they have received reports of similar payments being made in the Free State. He says they are investigating. “We have picked up the problem and activity taking place in Limpopo. We have recently got information that there is activity taking place in Free Sate. We are not going to let this matter go without being challenged. We can assure the public that we will investigate and proper measures will be taken if this is found to be true. However, I would not want to point fingers at a particular company at this moment”.
