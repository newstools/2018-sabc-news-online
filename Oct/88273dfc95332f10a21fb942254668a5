The trial of Nigerian Pastor Timothy Omotoso has been postponed to next Tuesday in the Port Elizabeth High Court. Presiding Judge Mandela Makaula has read an affidavit from Omotoso asking him to recuse himself from the case. The affidavit says that the judge is overly sympathetic, identified and has aligned with the first witness, Cheryl Zondi. It further reads that Makaula is biased with Zondi and prejudiced against Omotoso and that he has disqualified himself from continuing with this case. Makaula dismissed this application last week, saying it had no merit. In a statement from the Jesus Dominion International church, congregants say Omotoso deserves a free and fair trial, without any impartiality. They have vowed to continue supporting their the pastor, referring to him as a man of God. They say the presumption of innocence must be upheld. The Nigerian evangelist is currently standing trial in Port Elizabeth on rape and human trafficking charges. Click below for more on the story:
