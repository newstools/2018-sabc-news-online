Ahead of the multi-billion rand construction of the Lesotho Highlands Phase 2, many are already getting their ducks in a row. From a mine worker during tough apartheid era, to a giant business entrepreneur, Lephema Lebona unveiled a world class Cement Plant and a fleet of luxury bus coaches, mainly to tackle sky rocketing unemployment in Lesotho. A mix of dance and song as another history making moment is made. From humble beginnings at the semi-rural areas of Lesotho to a top notch business empire, amid tough economic challenges, others are seeing a window of opportunity. Lesotho Minister of Communications Chief Thesele Maseribane, “As government of Lesotho, we are very proud of our business fraternity especially in this kind of event when we are already getting close to the second phase of the Lesotho Highlands water project.” And a support from business colleagues. MGC, Sam Matekane, “We are trying by all means to make sure that even under these tough conditions we try to make things work and possible so that our people can get jobs and be able to do something for their families in return.” Afri Expo Textiles Teboho Kobeli, “He has taken a very bold step even in these conditions, you know globally and regionally what we are going through.” A selfless and highly determined entrepreneur continues to defy the odds. Maluti Mountain Cement’s Lephema Lebona, “I wasn’t doing it only for the success of Lephema executives but all the efforts and everything we have been struggling to get up to where we are, it was for the betterment and the success of Basotho.” “I always had a dream whereby I always wanted Basotho to understand as a small country as we are, but we have to practice, we have to learn not to be the consumers, but to be the producers.” The cement plant is expected to largely stimulate an ailing Lesotho economy, and open up hundreds of employment opportunities for Basotho.
