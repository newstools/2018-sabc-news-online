The Verulam Magistrate’s Court has ruled that Kessie Nair be sent for mental observation. Nair, a former Ethekwini councillor, posted a video of himself calling President Cyril Ramaphosa the derogatory K-word. Nair cast a lonely figure in court after his family deserted him. His lawyer was the only one there to defend him. Magistrate Ncumisa Gcolotela ruled he be sent for mental observation for 28 days. He will be kept at Fort Napier Psychiatric hospital in Pietermaritzburg. The defence applied for bail, but Nair’s family opposed it, saying it will not accommodate him. The bail application was postponed to next Tuesday. Nair made news when he posted a video on social media of himself calling President Cyril Ramaphosa the derogatory K-word. He is facing seven counts of crimen injuria and two charges related to the Riotous Assemblies Act.
