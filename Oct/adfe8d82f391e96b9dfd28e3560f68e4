Deputy President David Mabuza is taking sick leave from Thursday. In a statement, the Presidency says Mabuza requested President Cyril Ramaphosa to take him off officiating at public engagements for a few days to rest. Mabuzaâ€™s sick leave follows the President who last week cancelled a scheduled trip to the Democratic Republic of Congo on advice by doctors that he recover from an upper respiratory tract infection before undertaking prolonged travel. The Presidency says Mabuza will return to his work programme soon.
