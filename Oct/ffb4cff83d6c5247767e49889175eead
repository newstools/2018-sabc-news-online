Residents in the neighborhood of the latest gun shooting in Pittsburgh are filled with grief and highly concerned about the frequent gun attacks across the country. A gunman entered a synagogue in the Squirrel Hill neighborhood and opened fire on Saturday morning, killing 11 people and injuring six others, including four police officers who tried to apprehend him. The gunman is now in custody. Authorities said he is in his 40’s and will face hate-crime charges. The neighborhood of Squirrel Hill is a tight knit community. Everyone seems to know someone who is a victim in this tragic event. “I just found out I have a friend that was shot. I don’t really know her status other than that she is okay. That’s all. I don’t know what else to say. I suspect that I’m going to know quite a few more. I hope I don’t,” said Shani Pelled, a Squirrel Hill resident. Other neighbors like Abbey Horst came to offer their support as best as they can. “Yeah we just wanted to be here and do what we could. It’s cold and rainy and people need coffee and donuts and someone there,” said Horst, a Squirrel Hill resident. Details are emerging that the gunman shouted anti-Semitic slurs as he shot his victims. US President Donald Trump denounced the attack. The White House said he will visit the city to grieve with the victims. While being deeply saddened by the tragedy, residents at the Squirrel Hill neighborhood are more concerned that the US is moving backwards not forwards. “It just makes you so aware of, despite being in a world that we think is progressing, and moving to a more centrist and just safer frame of mind, it’s not,” said Pelled.
