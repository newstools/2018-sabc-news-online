Chairperson of the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa) Khanyisile Kweyama says they’re committed to put in place a turnaround plan to deal with the problems currently facing Metrorail trains in the Western Cape. Prasa is briefing Parliament’s Portfolio Committee on Transport in Cape Town following a spate of fires on trains on the Cape Flats. Kweyama says they’re frustrated by the situation but would like to address those issues aside from the Committee. She says a developed rescue plan will be presented to the Department of Transport soon. The rail agency also says they’ve lost about R635-million countrywide due to train fires over the past three years. CEO Sibusiso Sithole says the Western Cape contributes to R450-million of the losses; which excludes damages of R150-million in Cape Town during October 2015. Sithole says they’re installing cameras at hotspots to identify possible perpetrators. Watch the video below for related news:
