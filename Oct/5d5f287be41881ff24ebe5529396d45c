The Democratic Alliance’s (DA) Western Cape Premier candidate Allan Winde says efforts of the provincial government to create jobs of the future are bearing fruit. Winde was visiting the Interactive Community Access Network (ICAN) centre in Elsies River, an initiative of the Western Cape Department of Economic Development and Tourism. Winde says the centre is part of a provincial ecosystem that includes several other internet based hubs. He says this has made the Western Cape the leading region on the continent in the creation of high tech jobs. “Right now, here on the southern tip of Africa, this region of the city of Cape Town and Stellenbosch is now, more than Nairobi and Lagos put together… there are 50 000 jobs already coming out of this tech ecosystem, and this enabling environment called the Ican centre is enabling people for their future economy.”
