The African National Congress in Gauteng says courts cannot be used to settle internal party processes. The party was reacting to the ruling of the High Court in Johannesburg which dismissed an application to interdict the 13th ANC Gauteng elective conference scheduled for this weekend in Tshwane. The application was brought by some disgruntled ANC members in Ekurhuleni. They claim among others that the recently elected Regional Executive Committee in Ekurhuleni and some branches were not properly constituted. However the court ruled that the application lacked urgency. ANC Gauteng spokesperson Motalatale Modiba says they are ready for the conference. “This should send a strong message to those that are thinking that they can just use court to derail internal processes. The ANC in Gauteng will this weekend hold a successful provincial conference as per our arrangement. Plans are afoot. We are ready.”
