Public Works Minister Thulas Nxesi says the country needs to develop astute leaders to combat corruption in government. This emerged at a career exhibition in Toli High School outside Lusikisiki in the Eastern Cape. On Thursday, Nxesi revealed that his department had lost R2 billion to fraud and corruption following an investigation by Special Investigation Unit. It looks like the government is fighting a losing battle against fraud and corruption. However, Nxesi says his department has taken action against some of those involved in corrupt activities within the department. “We have taken disciplinary action against those who were implicated. Some have been suspended. Some received written warnings, while some appealed our decision.” Nxesi believes that the government needs to invest in young people for a better tomorrow and equip them with highly technical skills to spearhead the ocean’s economy in nearby Port St John’s. “We want to train local young people in oceans economy and also to recruit these learners to the Public Works Department because we are faced with corruption all round.” His department has adopted Toli High School through its program aimed at supporting learners from Grade 10 to Grade 12 with bursaries. Learner Kamva Mvovo, who wants to be a doctor, says, “We are glad the minister has visited our school. He has made a number of promises. We will have to wait and see them get fulfilled. I want to do medicine because I love people. I have passion for science and maths.” Another aspirant doctor Ntobeko Mathinjwa says, “We are faced with challenges and we are in the rural areas. So most of the learners stay afar and it is a risk for most students. We have no bridges here and most of us learners do not attend school when it is raining.” The department says the first intake of students who were assisted with bursaries through the program of supporting excellent learners, is now busy with their masters’ degree.
