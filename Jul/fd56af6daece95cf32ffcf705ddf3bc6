Police are hunting for the owner of a farm in Harding in southern KwaZulu-Natal where millions of Mandrax tablets, thought to have a street value of about R300 million, have been confiscated at the farm during a police raid. On the outside, it appears to be an ordinary sheep farm. But inside, the farm house is a bustling drug laboratory. Massive amounts of Mandrax tablets are produced and packaged on an ongoing basis. On Wednesday evening, police searched the property, arresting two people believed to be employees. They also seized a dispensary book with information of where the drugs are sent. It’s believed the drugs are transported by trucks to both local and international destinations. “The owner seems to be South African; he has purchased a second farm in Howick and is around the country. The commissioner gives him 12 hours and I’m giving him 24 hours. We are told that the market is Cape Town, Johannesburg and Durban. But by the look of the massiveness of production we believe its on the international market as well,” says Police minister Bheki Cele. The farm was purchased two years ago. Cele would not reveal the exact value of the drugs but says the investigation into one of the biggest drug busts in the country’s history, is ongoing.
