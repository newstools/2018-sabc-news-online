The Federation of Unions of South Africa (Fedusa) has added its voice to those condemning the hijacking and kidnapping of Passenger Rail Agency (Prasa) Board Chairperson Khanyisile Kweyama. Fedusa says the information made available by Gauteng police thus far indicates that Kweyama was pepper-sprayed before being bundled into the boot of her car by the two hijackers. Kweyama, who is also an SABC Board member, was driven around for three hours before she was dumped with her car in Kathlehong on the East Rand. Fedusa General Secretary Dennis George says he hopes that Kweyama will be back soon in office to continue with what he describes as her invaluable job of cleaning up the parastatals. George says Fedusa and its affiliate the United National Transport Union wants a Prasa board that will not be intimidated and distracted by such acts of senseless criminality. He is calling on the board to focus fully on its commitment to confront the challenges facing the passenger rail association which include improving customer service and good corporate governance. Kweyama was appointed board chairperson a few months ago by Transport Minister Blade Nzimande who said that the new boardâ€™s first task is to root out corruption and tender fraud in the association.
