Power utility Eskom has offered a 7% wage increase for members affiliated to the National Union of Metal Workers (Numsa). Numsa says Eskom gave them two wage agreement options which they will take to their members for final decision. The first option consists of a 7% wage increase for the next three years with a housing allowance, while the second option consists of a 7.5% wage increase with no housing allowance. The union says they will be meeting with Eskom next week to finalise the wage settlement. Earlier in June, the cash strapped power utility announced a no pay increases and unions threatened a shutdown. NUM, Solidarity and the Numsa called on Eskom to hike wages for their members to between 8 and 8.5%. The wage offer has been revised down to between 7% and 7.5%. Numsa general Secretary Irvin Jim says:”We would have loved to take it to our members but we can say that the 7% for the tree year period and then after 7.5% and 7.7% for the next two years. We regard this as progress and we are taking this back to our members for consultation.” Eskom spokesperson Khulu Phasiwe says:”We have put on the table a revised offer based on two options. The first option is 7%, based on the first three years with a housing allowance, and the second option is 7.5% for the first year and then 7% for each of the remaining two years without any housing allowance. So the unions are going to take this matter to their members and we will hear from them.” Unions had also demanded a R750 housing allowance and once off bonuses of 12% for workers Numsa says they are optimistic they will be able to settle the wage negotiations soon. “Our obsession now is to resolve this round of negotiations; we have given Eskom a huge package of cost drivers that must be addressed.” Related video click below:
