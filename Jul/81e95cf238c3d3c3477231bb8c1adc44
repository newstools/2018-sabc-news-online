The South African Friends of Israel together with political parties African Christian Democratic Party (ACDP) and Congress of People (COPE) have called on the South African government to reinstate the country’s ambassador to Israel. This as hundreds of Christians and Jews marched to the Union Building in Pretoria to raise concerns over what they call is an increasing anti-Israel rhetoric from the government. Calling for divine intervention to mend deescalating relations between South Africa and Israel. South Africa withdrew its ambassador to Israeli following the killing of Palestinian protestors at the Gaza border in May. Demonstrators say South Africa jumped the gun in the matter. “Since parliament took a decision that we should have an embassy there, we are now robbed of access to the leadership of Israel to impact and influence them. Parliament… no body authorised the government of ANC to do. What they’ve done, it’s wrong. They should have asked parliament,”  said Cope leader, Mosiuoa Lekota. “We as Christians community Israel still remains a biblical homeland for our faith and therefore we cannot detach ourselves from Israel because of politics in our country,” says South African Friends of Israel, Bafana Modise. The recalling of South Africa’s ambassador to Israel. Political party EFF had also urged government to shut down the Israeli embassy here in South Africa. “ The lord says in genesis three, ‘I will bless those who bless you and curse those who curse you,” if the eff curses Israel, watch what’s going to happen in next years’ elections. If ANC curses Israel, watch what’s going to happen to them next year during the elections,” said ACDP president Rev Kenneth Meshoe. Government said recalling the South African ambassador to Israel was only a temporary measure depending on the progress towards peace.
