There’s speculation that Eskom will shed more light on corruption, when the hard-pressed power utility releases its 2017/18 financial results on Monday. Eskom indicted that it was aware of on-going irregularities and irregular expenditure linked to tender processes in a statement that was released earlier this month on the JSE’s news service. The financial results will have an impact on the wage negations between Eskom and  trade unions Numsa, the NUM and Solidarity, that started about a month ago. Eskom has offered a 7% wage increase to members of the three unions. Unions say Eskom has given them two wage agreement options which they will take to their members for final decision. The first option consists of a 7% wage increase for the next three years with housing allowance, while the second option consists of a seven-point-five per cent wage increase without housing allowance. The unions say they will meet with Eskom this week to finalise the wage settlement. Watch related videos below:
