Only a handful of people have turned up for picket over fuel prices orgnaised by the Democratic Alliance (DA), Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (OUTA) and others at the National Treasury in central Pretoria. A number of groups, including the regional National Taxi Alliance and the South African National Taxi Council (Santaco) were expected to take part. The protest is aimed at putting pressure on government to reduce the fuel levy and bring down fuel prices. The DA says a 20% reduction of the fuel levy could bring the petrol price down to around R15 a litre. Prices are currently around R16 a litre, with a marginal one-cent-a-litre increase taking effect on Wednesday along with a four-cent decrease for diesel and a four-cent increase for paraffin. OUTA spokesperson Wayne Duvenhage says: “Civil society at large needs to continuously challenge government on all matters that are not in the best interest of society. Remember we started our movement on the back of the e-toll discussion which was certainly not in the interest of society and we have seen that the pressure has brought that system to it’s knees and it’s about to collapse.” Related video
