Farmers suffering from the effects of a drought near Mossel Bay in the Southern Cape have been thrown a lifeline. A humanitarian organisation, Gift-of-the-Givers, has delivered two truck-loads of much-needed fodder to the Gouritzmond area. The 110 bales will be shared between 15 farmers. The area has suffered a severe drought, while the rest of the Southern Cape is slowly recovering from it.   The fodder will ensure that the animals are fed for the next few weeks. “I wish I could open my heart so that they can see how thankful we are. We can feed the cattle. We can feed the sheep so they can stay alive through the drought until Christ gives us rain,” says farmer, Jannie Zietsman. The Gift of the Givers sourced the feed from Johannesburg and Bloemfontein. They say they had to do something to improve the helpless situation. “This is one of the first interventions into Mossel Bay. On Saturday we gave them some mielies but the animal feed is very beneficial,” says Ali Sablay of the Gift of The Givers. On Thursday, the organisation will deliver feed to struggling farmers in Aberdeen in the Eastern Cape.
