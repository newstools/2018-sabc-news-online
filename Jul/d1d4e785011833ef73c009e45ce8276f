ANC president, Cyril Ramaphosa has called on Gauteng members of the party to work harder in order for the ANC to regain its former glory. He officially opened the 13th provincial conference at St. Georges Hotel in Irene, east of Pretoria. Ramaphosa says they’re still bleeding from losing major Metro Municipalities during the local government elections in 2016. He says it’s in the hands of a collective of comrades who have prospects of a united ANC to make sure that unity is the order of the day. Courts earlier rejected attempts by aggrieved members to interdict both the Gauteng conference and the KwaZulu-Natal one taking place in Durban. Ramaphosa has reminded delegates of the oath they took when joining the ANC, “Unity is a process if people see leaders disagreeing publicly – they get confused. Let’s stop fighting and embrace in unity.” Click the link for more:
