South African Minister of Water Affairs Gugile Nkwinti has completed a two-day tour in Lesotho. The minister signed a joint agreement with his Lesotho counterpart, aimed at addressing concerns relating to the implementation of Phase 2 of the Lesotho Highlands Water Project. The project will see the construction of Polihali Dam which aims to boost supply of water to Gauteng. Lesotho will benefit from electricity supply from Hydro-power plant component of the dam. The new agreement will see a faster and improved implementation plan of the Phase 2 construction. Both ministers say they hope to address the ills of the past and adopt a more balanced approach that benefits both countries. Nkwinti says, “The questions which are very pertinent and correct that have been raised in terms of equal opportunities; they are covered in this media briefing. Border movement of people, good and services is one of them and then, the mining issue also is dealt with; the work permits; tax related matters; implementation of hydro-power.” While the veracity of some allegations of corruptions remain to be tested in the courts of laws, both parties agree that the fourth coming Joint Bilateral Cooperation’s Commission will pave the way for the two countries to come up with a solid and binding agreement. Lesotho Water Affairs Minister Samonyane Ntsekele says:”We are very hopeful that in October we can have a JBCC and for that matter, Lesotho requested a postponement. It is not a South African problem now.” The Lesotho Highlands Water Treaty came into effect in 1986 and since its inception, competing interests such as mining, wind and solar energy are up for consideration as the treaty goes for a review. The envoy acknowledged the irreparable damage that is associated with the previous project delays and affirmed the continued co-operation between both governments, especially on the trans boundary water resource management.
