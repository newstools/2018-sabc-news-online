It has emerged that five people died when a mini bus taxi collided head on with bakkie on the N2 near Lwandlane in Kwabhanca in the Eastern Cape Monday night. Four passengers died on scene while one passenger died at the hospital Tuesday morning. The crash has taken the total number of road fatalities in the province to nine in the past two days. This after four people died in two separate crashes near Komani on Sunday night. Transport department spokesperson Unathi Binqose has urged motorists to obey the rules of the road. “Some of these deaths that we experienced over the past couple of days could have easily been avoided had our users obeyed the rules of the roads. So we are pleading with them to be extra cautious and obey and off course to be patient on the roads.”
