Parliament has confirmed receipt of a request for it to reconvene early.  Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) MP, Mkhuleko Hlengwa, is calling on urgent parliamentary debate to address the matter of rising fuel costs. Parliament is currently in recess with MPs out doing constituency work. A few committees are still sitting to deal with urgent work. Parliament will resume its business in August but the issue of rising fuel prices has become a concern for many. Addressing BRICS last week, President Cyril Ramaphosa, also called on retailers not to raise their prices in response to the fuel hikes. He has asked the business sector to first wait on government’s intervention, before making any pricing decisions. Meanwhile, Parliament will shortly decide if it will reconvene earlier than expected. “We can confirm that the Speaker of the national assembly has received the request of Mr Hlengwa of the IFP. The request is being considered by the speaker and an appropriate decision will be made regarding it,” says Parliamentary Spokesperson, Moloto Mothapo. WATCH BELOW:
