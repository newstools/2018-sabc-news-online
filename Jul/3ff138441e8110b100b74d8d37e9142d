As part of Nelson Mandela’s centenary celebrations, the Department of Police will on Wednesday host activities at Thembalethu in George in the Southern Cape. It will include the handing out of blankets to the elderly and disabled as well as a march and cleaning campaign. Speaking during a memorial lecture hosted by the local ANC branch at Lawaaikamp on Tuesday, Deputy Minister of Police, Bongani Mkongi said they call on people to recognise their ability to have a positive effect on others. He says they want Madiba’s legacy to live on. He says: “It’s about Nelson Mandela, decolonisation of Africa and South Africa. The issue is for our people to continue the struggle, to make sure we are moving from the liberation struggle into economic freedom.” Also speaking at the memorial lecture, ANC MPL Cameron Dugmore, says a lot more needs to be done before Madiba’s vision of South Africa can be realised. “I think it’s very significant that we meet at a time where our country can celebrate a legacy of someone who did so much to bring our country together and help us usher in a democracy.” “But all of us would agree there’s still too much inequality, too much poverty in our country and we need to deal with the issue of unemployment,” adds Dugmore.
