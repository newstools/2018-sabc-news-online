The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) is on Thursday expected to ask the Randburg Magistrate’s court for a postponement in Duduzane Zuma’s case. Former president Jacob Zuma’s son faces two counts of culpable homicide and an alternative charge of negligent driving. In February 2014, Duduzane Zuma rear-ended a taxi after losing control of his Porsche on the M1 highway in Johannesburg. The collision led to the deaths of Phumzile Dube and Nanki Mashaba. While Dube died on the scene, Mashaba is believed to have died in hospital several weeks later. NPA spokesperson Phindi Mjonondwane says: “We are going to ask the court for a postponement in order to disclose the contents of the docket to the defence team.” Related video below
