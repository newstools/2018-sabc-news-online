Preparations are under way for the Economic Freedom Fighters’ fifth anniversary celebrations to be held in Mdantsane township outside East London in the Eastern Cape. Party members have embarked on a campaign to urge residents to attend the celebrations. The EFF says the celebrations will be held at Sisa Dukashe stadium on the 28th of this month. Some party members and residents had this to say. “What is happening here as you see the fighters here in Mdantsane , they are mobilising for that day they want people to come in numbers. Malema wants to know about their problems we still going to meet the community. We invite everyone in Mdantsane, if you are DA ,ANC and Agang come to Sisa Dukashe, this is a big cake . I believe that there has been slow progress ever since the last time I think its about time to show some change.”
