The Chairperson of the Board of the Passenger Rail Agency of SA (Prasa) Khanyisile Kweyama was on Thursday evening hijacked near her home in Houghton. Kweyama, who was coming from a board meeting at the SABC offices, was put into the boot  of her car and dumped over three hours later in Katlehong in Ekurhuleni. She was followed by a BMW which bumped her from behind, she was then pepper-sprayed and bundled into the boot of her car. They took her bag, phones, and two Ipads belonging to the SABC and BrandSA, where she is also a board member. Kweyama said “The men told me they only needed money and tried to withdraw money from my card without success and then simply abandoned me locked in the car. For people who spent three hours with me bemoaning their poverty and emphasising their need for money it is strange that they eventually just left without that money. Kweyama wants to thank the residents of Katlehong who assisted her generously to ensure she was both safe and in touch with her family once she got out of the car. She was appointed to the Prasa board almost three months ago and is the second high ranking official of parastatal to be hijacked within that period. Acting CEO at the time Lindikhaya Zide was hijacked as he drove from his office on a non-working day. He too was put into the boot and later dumped without being hurt. The hijackers at the time also made off with his bag and technological gadgets. Recently Prasa has been the subject of widespread corruption through a number of tenders and the new board has been investigating and reversing some of the deals.
