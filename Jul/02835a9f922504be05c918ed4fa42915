At least two police officers were killed on Monday in Buea, a city in western Cameroon that has become the centre of a campaign for independence by English-speaking separatists, a local source said Tuesday. A separate hospital source however said five police, as well as one civilian, had died. The deaths mark a fresh escalation in violence between the security forces and armed separatists who want two English-speaking regions to become independent from the rest of the French-speaking country.
