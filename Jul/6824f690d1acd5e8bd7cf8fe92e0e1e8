Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (Outa) CEO Wayne Duvenage says the African National Congress’s (ANC) plan to scrap e-tolls in Gauteng is all talk and no action. The newly-elected ANC leadership in Gauteng has resolved to push for the withdrawal of e-tolls as part of the resolutions of the recent congress. Duvenage says the governing party made this promise merely because it feared a possible loss of electoral support in next year’s general elections. However Duvenage says, “We all know that e-toll has failed it has around 25-percent compliance but needs at least 95% compliance to survive. I think what they are saying that because it’s a no brainer and elections are coming up and the ANC has been saying this for the last six years. Since the beginning since when society called for it to be launched our research shows that it was doomed from the day it started.”
