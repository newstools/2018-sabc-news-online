Police Minister, Bheki Cele, has visited the family of the deceased police constable who was gunned down this week in Mfuleni on the Cape Flats. The 22-year-old Vuyo Kosani was off duty when he was shot in the head on Wednesday night. No one has yet been arrested in connection with the murder. Police Minister Bheki Cele has called on communities affected by police killings to help bring the perpetrators to book. Three police officers have been killed in the Western Cape this year. The senseless killing has left a family bereaved. Constable Kosani was out with friends on Wednesday night when he was shot in the head. He later died in hospital. Kosani had been a police officer for four years and had been stationed at the Provincial Stabilisation Unit in Delft. Family member Unathi Matshoba says it is difficult to come to terms with this tragedy. Cele has urged the community to come forward with information that could assist the police in their investigation. “The call is on the community. You can’t tell me that nobody saw what happened. Somebody say what happened and we are urging them to come and help. The best reward for all of us, including whoever spoke to us, is that the criminals are arrested and sent to prison.” While visiting the constable’s family, Cele said the lives of too many police officers are being cut short, especially those who are still young officers in the police force. He has urged the community to come forward with information that could assist police in their investigation.
