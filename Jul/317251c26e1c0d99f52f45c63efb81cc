Parliament’s oversight committee on Police has urged the Hawks to prioritise alleged corruption cases involving VBS Mutual bank. The Reserve Bank has placed VBS bank under curatorship following allegations that more than R1 billion was stolen from it. The committee says it will invite the Hawks to Parliament when it resumes its sittings next month to get a briefing on the matter. Committee chairperson Francois Beukman says white collar crime in the financial sector impacts negatively on economic growth and depositors’ confidence. VBS was placed under curatorship in March this year after allegedly taking deposits illegally from municipalities and becoming cash strapped. Related video
