The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) says police are expected to continue with their investigation of media boss, Given Mkhari and his wife Ipeleng after prosecutors provisionally withdrew assault charges against them. The NPA says the docket has been referred back to the police for further investigation. The couple opened assault charges against each other at the Randburg police station after what’s believed to have been a physical altercation at their home on Saturday. They were both released on R1 000 bail. NPA spokesperson Phindi Louw says: “A decision whether or not to prosecute is a prerogative of the NPA. Two dockets were brought to the prosecutor. They are charged with assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm and they briefly appeared before a magistrate court.” Louw says the matter was adjourned and during this adjournment information emerged which needed further investigation.
