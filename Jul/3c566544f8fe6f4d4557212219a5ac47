Cape Town Mayor, Patricia De Lille, says she’s unconcerned about a motion of no confidence vote to be brought against her by the DA on Thursday. De Lille’s been accused of maladministration in the council, which she’s denied. She recently won a High Court application challenging her expulsion from the party and also narrowly survived an earlier no confidence motion. De Lille says she will respect any outcome of Thursday’s council sitting. “Well what must be must be! and I remain focused on what I have to do. The people of the City of Cape Town have got no problems with the mayor.  I am always accessible and available to them, but I also have to respect the right of the council to have a motion of no confidence and I will abide by the outcome.” ANC to table motion against Speaker Dirk Smit Earlier the ANC in the City of Cape Town says it will table a motion of no confidence against DA speaker Dirk Smit during a council meeting on Thursday. ANC opposition leader, Xolani Sotashe, alleges that Smit had passed illegal decisions especially when stripping De Lille of her executive powers. “We warned them as the ANC don’t do this, rather propose to the minister of Cogta to review the municipal structures act, they did not want to listen to us, the speaker went to sought the legal opinion and he was advised that the decision taken by the council was procedural and unlawful.” Watch related  videos below:
