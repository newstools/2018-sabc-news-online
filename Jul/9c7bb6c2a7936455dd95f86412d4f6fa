Parliament says it is serious about curbing violence against children. This is in response to a call by the South African Human Rights Commission during its recent appearance before Parliament’s Social Development Committee. The commission wants Parliament to establish a multi-party caucus on violence against children. Parliament’s Spokesperson Moloto Mothapo says the request was made before a committee of parliament so parliamentary processes will have to be followed. He says: “This might probably happen through a report that must be by that particular committee for the houses of the institution to make a decision. However, we need to emphasise that the issue of violence against children is a matter that parliament takes very seriously.” “As we are talking now, there are various committees of parliament that are dealing with the matter,” he adds.
