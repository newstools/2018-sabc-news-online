The number of mine workers killed underground at the Palabora Mining Company in Limpopo has risen to six after the body of another miner was found over Sunday night. All six were trapped in an incident early on Sunday morning. It’s believed that a fire broke out at one of the underground conveyor belts. Mine spokesperson Lydia Radebe says, “At the time 220 employees were on shift and most of those employees except for the six that we are now talking about were saved. It’s a very sad situation, we wish we could have saved everyone but we were unable to do so, and we’re sending our condolences to the families of the lost colleagues.”
