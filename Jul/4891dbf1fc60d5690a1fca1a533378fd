A pastor from Thembalethu in the Southern Cape is on Thursday set to appear in the George Magistrate’s court on a charge of murder. The man is accused of killing 25-year old Hlompho Mohapi, whose body was found next to a gravel road in Herold’s Bay two weeks ago. She had been stabbed several times and her throat partially slit. Mohapi was lured to the area under the pretext of a potential job offer at George Airport. Speaking at her memorial service Wednesday night, her uncle Lebohang Koloi said the family welcomed the arrest of the suspect. He says: “It’s a relief for all of us. We appreciate the progress made by the SAPS, we will now rest knowing the suspect has been arrested.” Related Videos below
