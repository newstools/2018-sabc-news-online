Gautrain is expected to continue with limited services on Tuesday as workers affiliated to the United National Transport Union (UNTU) continue their strike. The company says on its Twitter account that a train service will operate during the peak period between Sandton and OR Tambo airport, stopping at Rhodesfield. A bus service will then operate over the same route from 9:00 until 16:00.  Gautrain workers disrupted services on Monday after wage negotiations reached a deadlock last week. Incidents of intimidation and violence were reported at the Midrand station. The union is demanding a 10% increase with other benefits. Gautrain spokesperson Kesagee Nayager says: “The company has offered an 8.6% across the board increase. In the current economic climate we believe this to be a generous offer, especially when considering that annually over the last five years, the company has granted increases in excess of 8% which was significantly above inflation. To increase the company’s offer any further is neither responsible nor sustainable.”
