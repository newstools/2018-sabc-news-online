Suspended Advocate Nomgcobo Jiba‘s lawyer Zola Majavu says although his client won her case at the Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA) in Bloemfontein on Tuesday, a further legal battle could delay her returning to work at the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA). Jiba and NPA’s Commercial Crimes Unit head, Advocate Lawrence Mrwebi successfully challenged the High Court judgment declaring them unfit to practice as advocates. The SCA found that the General Council of the Bar had failed to prove any misconduct on the part of Jiba in the controversial withdrawal of murder and corruption charges against former Police Crime Intelligence head Richard Mdluli. In December, the High Court in Pretoria set aside the decision by National Prosecuting Authority boss, Shaun Abrahams, to withdraw charges against Jiba. Jiba was also not allowed to enter the NPA offices in Pretoria. However, Jiba’s attorney Zola Majavu says another case by Freedom Under law against his client will be heard next month.
