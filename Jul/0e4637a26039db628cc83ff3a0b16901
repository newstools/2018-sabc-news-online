Women in Port Elizabeth took to the streets to raise awareness about the rising scourge of violence and abuse against women and children in South Africa. Statistics show that in South Africa, one in every five women over the age of 18 has experienced some form of physical violence. Although stats are not clear, the number of femicide in South Africa is becoming problematic. The abuse against the girl child is also on the rise. As women’s month approaches females are calling for action against the violence and abuse. About 40% of rape reported in South Africa is committed against girl children. Port Elizabeth #TOTALSHUTDOWN group says enough is enough. “We want government to take action because women are being killed, raped, sexually and physically abused, every day children are going missing.” It was a small turnout but the message was clear. Organisers feel those personally affected are silent due to the stigma attached to violence against women. Siroptimist International, Dianne Connel says: “They very complacent and they quick to share Facebook pages with the disasters and the sadness but nobody want to stand and say I had enough.” The women have urged many to come out in their numbers and make their voices heard. Next week the deputy minister of Justice and Constitutional Development, John Jeffery, will with other leaders from national government. Participate in the national #100MenMarch against intimate femicide and violence against women and children.
