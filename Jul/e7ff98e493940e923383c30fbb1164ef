The case of former president Jacob Zuma has been provisionally adjourned to November 30 after both the defence and prosecution teams requested the postponement. Zuma is facing 16 charges of fraud, corruption and racketeering stemming from a multi-billion-rand arms deal. Last month, the case was adjourned to allow the conclusion of a court case about state funding for Zuma’s legal costs. Earlier this month, Zuma fired his long-time attorney Michael Hulley. Advocate Kemp J Kemp‚ who acted for Zuma for over a decade has also been replaced, allegedly due to Zuma’s inability to pay the mounting legal bills. The adjournment was also aimed at affording Zuma’s co-accused, a French manufacturing company, time to make representations to the National Director of Public Prosecutions (NDPP) as to why it should not be prosecuted.
