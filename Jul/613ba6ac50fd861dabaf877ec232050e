Western Cape Community Safety Minister, Dan Plato, says community leaders in Zwelihle Township in Hermanus have expressed a renewed willingness to end violent protests in the area. A heavy police contingent has been deployed to maintain law and order. Angry residents have called for the release of a community leader arrested for public violence recently. They also previously prevented Premier Helen Zille from addressing them. Plato says he will meet with community leaders soon. He says: “My message when I talked to the community leaders is that we need to find a middle ground otherwise the stand-off between them, government and the broader community of Hermanus will just continue. That stand-off is not good. So they promised that they are willing to talk to me.” Related video
