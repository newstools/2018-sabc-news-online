The R120-million earmarked to build a multi-million heritage site has gone missing. The site was meant to be built at the old Ramkraal prison in Bloemfontein. Opposition parties want those responsible to be held accountable. Eight years ago, the Free State Government initiated a project to turn this dilapidated building into a multi-million rand heritage site. R120-million had been allocated to make it possible. The site was to house the Free State legislature and was spearheaded by the Department of Public Works in 2010. Instead, the millions have gone missing and the building has become a dilapidated structure, a den for criminals. DA member of the legislature, David Janse Van Vuuren says, “One of the biggest problems in the Free State in the departments and municipalities is the fact that there is no consequences management. People get away with poor financial decisions with procurements they can’t account. They must tell people where there money went.” A high level team of investigators including the auditor general is probing what happened to the millions. EFF Free State leader Kgotso Morapela says, “We have enlisted the service of the auditor general we are happy that she is knowledgeable people she has promised us that the report on the investigations will be released in September people need to know we need to what happened with money squandered.” The auditor general’s report will be complete by September. Free State legislature Head of Communications Life Mokone says, “We are happy with investigations by the joint committee. Site visits were conducted; organisations were brought before the committee to provide evidence and once work is done presentations will be done.” Investigations are also expected to reveal what happened to an additional 8 million rand that was allocated for fencing the building.
