Parliament’s Public Enterprises Committee which is probing allegations of state capture says it will not call Duduzane Zuma to appear before it. It says it will instead recommend that law enforcement agencies such as the police further investigate possible criminal cases against former president Jacob Zuma’s son, for failing to appear before the Parliamentary inquiry. In March Duduzane and some of the Gupta family failed to appear before the committee despite summons being issued against them. Committee Chairperson Zukiswa Rantho says they will recommend in their report yet to be submitted to the Speaker of the National Assembly, that possible criminal action to be taken against Duduzane for snubbing the committee. “We therefore make recommendation that Parliament must take action. It is not us as the committee that we take action.” “Our recommendation as the committee ,we will ask the other investigating bodies like the Hawks and the police to investigate the matter further and then they will see if there is a criminal case and they will open a criminal case or whatever case the type of case they see it relevant for the opening.”  Click video below:
