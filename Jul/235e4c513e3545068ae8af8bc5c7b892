Amnesty International says the United Nations Security Council’s much-anticipated vote to impose an arms embargo on South Sudan, is a step in the right direction towards minimizing harm to civilians in the war-torn nation. It also calls on all states, especially South Sudan’s neighbours, to now strictly enforce the arms embargo, and play their part in silencing the guns. South Sudan has been plunged in war since 2013, after President Salva Kiir accused his then-deputy Riek Machar of plotting a coup. The war has since killed tens of thousands of people and displaced four million others. A peace deal was reached in August of 2015, several subsequent ceasefires and security agreements have failed to quell the conflict. Related video click below:
