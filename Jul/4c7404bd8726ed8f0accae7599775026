Metrorail staff have extinguished another fire onboard a train at Cape Town Station on Tuesday. This after three coaches were set alight on two platforms over the past weekend. The company says 15 carriages were torched in three separate incidents in recent weeks, causing millions of rands of damage and extensive train delays. Cape Town Fire spokesperson, Theo Layne, says a train seat caught light this afternoon but the incident was brought under control by staff. Earlier, Platforms 13 and 14 at Cape Town station will remain closed on Tuesday while repair work is underway. Crews started on Monday with repairs of the overhead electrical cables and signals after Saturday’s train fire.
