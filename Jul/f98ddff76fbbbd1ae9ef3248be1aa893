President Cyril Ramaphosa has, on behalf of the Government and the people of South Africa, sent a message of condolences to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and to the Government and the people of Japan following the torrential rains and landslides that have left 69 people dead, with many others injured. The disaster has also destroyed residential, commercial and public property. President Ramaphosa said the thoughts of the South African people are with the people of Japan during this difficult time. The South African Embassy in Japan has not reported any South African victims and will maintain close contact with authorities. The Embassy stands ready to provide assistance should there be any South African citizens in need of support. Those concerned about the wellbeing of their relatives in Japan can contact the Department of International Relations and Cooperation (DIRCO) on 012 351 1000. Meanwhile, rescue and clean-up operations are underway in Japan. In the city of Kurashiki in Western Japan, 1,850 people were still trapped on Sunday (July 8), according to the country’s national broadcaster. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe says rescuers are “working against time.” Japan’s government has set up an emergency management center. Some 54,000 rescuers have been dispatched to the affected areas. Since Thursday (July 5) parts of western Japan have received three times the usual rainfall for the whole of July, setting off floods and landslides. Although rain has stopped and floodwaters have receded in some parts of the country, evacuation orders are still in place for some 2 million people. Businesses have also been affected with automakers Mazda Motor Corp and Daihatsu Motor Co suspending operations at several plants on Saturday due to a shortage of parts or dangerous conditions. Further rain warnings are in effect, with 300 milimeters predicted to fall in some areas by Monday (July 9) morning.- Additional reporting Reuters
