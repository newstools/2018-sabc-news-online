The National Transport Department says motorists should continue paying e-tolls as this is still government policy. This comes after the ANC in Gauteng resolved at its recent conference to scrap the controversial system. Some motorists are already asking for refunds following the announcement. Mention e-tolls and you will likely be greeted by  grimace, arguably the most detested system conceived in democratic South Africa. The system is designed to finance Gauteng’s freeway upgrades. Lomso Dyasi purchased an e-tag, a decision he now regrets. “I mean there are a lot of people who didn’t pay but I am paying, I don’t know how much but yeah, I would love to have my money back” The 37-year old driver spends at least R36 per week on e-tolls. “Every time I reach my limit, it takes from my bank account.” A sentiment echoed by other e-tag holders. The ANC in Gauteng grappled with the issue at length during its elective conference. Gauteng ANC’s Panyaza Lesufi said: “We reached a point where we felt that instead of imposing something that is openly rejected, we’d rather withdraw it completely and make sure that we start the consultation with national government.” A system the Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (OUTA) fought against for six years. OUTA Portfolio manager Rudie Heyneke says:”The one is an announcement to say we’re scrapping the rates and fees to a zero, the announcement can go further and say there are litigations at this stage to see if this is a legitimate scheme or not, it is one of the arguments of OUTA” But for now, motorists like Dyasi can only hold their breath and hope for the best. Meanwhile, the ANC continues to drive the process.
