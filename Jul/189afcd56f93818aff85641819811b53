Members of the National Education, Health and Allied Workers’ Union (Nehawu) at the University of Fort Hare in the Eastern Cape say they are willing to meet with the management of the institution in an attempt to put an end to a month long wage strike. Nehawu members are on strike at all campuses including Bhisho, East London and Alice. The strike has resulted in the postponement of mid-year exams. The union has revised their salary increase and wage demand from 15 to 10%. Secretary of the union at Fort Hare Mzi Lingela elaborates: “The strike is still on. We were supposed to meet with the management for bargaining today but management requested to postpone the planned bargaining. They are going to give us another date so we are still waiting for them. Currently we are sitting between 10 and 8% just to show our willingness as Nehawu. We can even settle to 8%. So we are waiting on the management to sit on the table and discuss and take it from there.” University spokesperson, Khotso Moabi says the collective bargaining process will resume soon. “We are trying to schedule another section in another 48 hours, the campus is operational currently the institution in offering 6.8 with a notch increase so we  need to meet ourselves somewhere exams are expected to resume next week we have full  complement of staff on campus and things are operation as usual.” WATCH RELATED VIDEO:
