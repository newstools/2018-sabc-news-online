The protesters decided to blockade the road after the were attempts to remove them from a piece of land they allegedly occupied illegally. The early morning traffic was affected and motorists were advised to use alternative roads. Police spokesperson, Lungelo Dlamini says: “Police are attending to the violence at the informal settlement and at this stage the roads have been blocked and the traffic has been directed to Olifantsfontein main road as well as the R21.” “We don’t know exactly why are they blocking the roads but we understand they illegally invaded land and the police are attempting to remove them,” adds Dlamini.
