Gauteng Roads and Transport MEC Ismail Vadi has threatened to interdict the Gautrain workers strike over alleged acts of intimidation. Striking train drivers allegedly prevented Gautrain buses from leaving the Midrand depot north of Johannesburg. They allegedly also placed a concrete beam on the rail track. Workers affiliated to the United National Transport Union went on strike on Monday. They are demanding among others a 10% wage increase. Gautrain operator, Bombela Concession company is offering 8.5%. Vadi says the alleged intimidations are concerning. “I’m extremely concerned about these reports I’m receiving. This is not within the law. So my appeal to the workers is if they want to strike, they have a right to withdraw their labour – that’s fine but they should act within the law. But if this kind of thing continues, I suppose we will have to take out an interdict against the striking workers,” says Vadi. Only three of the ten Gautrain stations are operational offering limited services. Talks were still deadlocked by Monday. For now commuters will have to make other arrangements to get to their preferred destinations.
