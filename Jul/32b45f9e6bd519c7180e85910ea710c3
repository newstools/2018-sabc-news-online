The National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) has confirmed that applications for 2019 will be placed on hold following a request by the Minister of Higher Education and Training, Naledi Pandor. Pandor had instructed NSFAS to halt its funding plans for next year until it sorts out the payment backlogs from 2017 and 2018. NSFAS Spokesperson Kagisho Mamabolo says: “The minister has indeed raised her concern in our ability to deliver an efficient and effective 2019 process. At the heart of this is to ensure that 2019 system and application processes are smooth. It is the request of the minister and supported by the board that all outstanding matters that are not resolved for 2017 and 2018 need to be finalised.” Watch the video below for more:
