President Cyril Ramaphosa has applauded the Nigerian government for consulting widely before it takes the decision to sign the Continental Free Trade Agreement (CFTA). Forty-nine African countries, including South Africa, have signed the agreement so far, but not Nigeria. Ramaphosa has been speaking in Abuja on the first day of his working visit. He says Nigeria joining the CFTA would help realise Africa’s potential. “We are optimistic about Africa’s future because of the momentous development over the last few months in forging a free trade area across the continent. So you as Nigeria should also be applauded as you go through the process of consulting and dealing with all the various role players, so it is in that regard that I say no pressure, take your time but don’t tarry too long because the continent is waiting for Nigeria and South Africa.”
