The public must not be frightened by the spate of suspicious devices found in and around Durban. Police have given the assurance that none of them was capable of exploding, but said they could have started a fire. It’s believed about six devices were found in the space of a week, mainly in major shopping malls like Gateway and the Pavillion. Some were hidden between cushions in major retail stores while others underneath cars. “We are investigating exactly what these devices were intended for, who was responsible for placing these devices at the places we found them and what’s the motive behind them,” saysNational Police Spokesperson, Colonel Vishnu Naidoo. Police called for calm and confirmed that no damage to property or injuries was caused. No one has been arrested yet and no one has claimed responsibility. The Hawks have taken over the investigation. WATCH RELATED VIDEO:
