Media Monitoring Africa has welcomed an out-of-court settlement, that will allow some parts of the SABC’s Inquiry into editorial interference to be open to the public and media. The SABC, Media Monitoring Africa, S.O.S Support Public Broadcasting Coalition and the Commission of Inquiry have settled out of court. In terms of the agreement, written and oral submissions by current or former SABC Board members and senior executives, as well as third parties will be open. Other staff members and whistle-blowers will still enjoy protection through confidentiality. The Commission is chaired by former Press Ombudsman, Joe Tlholoe. Media Monitoring Africa’s Director, William Bird says, “We think that it’s found a very positive way forward, in terms of ensuring that elements of the enquiry can be open, so people can get a better sense of the issues surrounding editorial interference. But we also think that it’s balanced against the need for confidentiality to ensure that those staffers. We thank the SABC for engaging and helping us find a solution that works for us, the Commission Chair and civil society.” The full version of the final report prepared by the Commission will be made public and the identities of confidential witnesses may be redacted from the final report. The full transcript of all oral hearings conducted by the Commission, save for those relating to confidential witnesses, will be made public.
