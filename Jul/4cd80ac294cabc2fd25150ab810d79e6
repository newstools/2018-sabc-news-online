Mahikeng Local Municipality in North West says government departments, private businesses and households are failing to pay their debts worth millions of rands, making it difficult to provide services to residents. The embattled municipality says it’s owed over a billion rand for services rendered. Mahikeng Local Municipality manager Tebogo Mokoena says it is worrying that even provincial government departments owe the municipality. “This municipality is being owed 1.1 billion debt by businesses and government departments. The department of Public Works alone nationally owes us R339 million, the department of Public Works provincially owes us R215 million. We’ve got buildings here that are standing here, this building here in terms of property rates owes us R33 million, housing corporations owe us R250 million,” says Mokoena.
