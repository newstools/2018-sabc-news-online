The presiding officer of the disciplinary hearing against suspended Sars commissioner Tom Moyane, Advocate Azhar Bham, is expected to hand down his ruling in the coming week. Moyane’s disciplinary hearing was held in Johannesburg on Saturday. Arguments were heard from President Cyril Ramaphosa’s counsel, Adocate Heidi Barnes and from Advocate Dali Mpofu representing Moyane. Misconduct charges against Moyane relate to unlawful bonus payments to his executive committee, misleading Parliament and instructing a SARS official not to cooperate with KPMG’s Sars investigation. Before the hearing, Moyane’s lawyer Eric Mabuza said he and his client were pleased to have the opportunity to clarify all the misconceptions. “You’ll remember that our client has always said that he needs an opportunity to clear his name. He’s complained about the unfairness of the inquiry, you would have also seen from the president’s submission, he said that Mr Moyane is sabotaging the inquiry which is not true. So, tomorrow we’ll have an opportunity to set the record straight and explain the reasons why Mr Moyane complains why the inquiry against him is unfair,” says Mabuza. Related Video
