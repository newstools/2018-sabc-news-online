Meter taxi operators at the Gautrain station in Sandton north of Johannesburg have appealed to the parties involved in the strike to resolve the impasse. Gautrain is operating a reduced service on Monday morning. The drivers say the strike is having a negative impact on their business. Meter taxi operators are desperately waiting at the Gautrain station with the hope of getting commuters. They are holding placards written taxi to lure customers from the trains operating during this peak hour. It’s a first come first serve for these meter taxi operators here.  The management also says that all the ticket stations will be closed and passengers are encouraged to use the vending machines. Sandton, Centurion and the Park station are the only stations open to commuters. Security officers have been placed at the station’s entrance to inform the commuters on the strike.
