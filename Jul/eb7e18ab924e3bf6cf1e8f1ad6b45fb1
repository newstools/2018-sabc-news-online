The National Prosecuting Authority(NPA) has confirmed that ANC employee Errol Velile Present will be back at the Roodepoort Magistrate’s court for formal bail application at the end of this month. It’s alleged Present was involved in a cash in transit heist in Dobsonville Soweto earlier this month. The ANC has since dismissed the employee who worked at the party’s headquarters, Luthuli House, in Johannesburg. NPA spokesperson Phindi Mjonondwana says Present appeared in the Roodepoort Magistrate’s court on Wednesday together with three other accused. They were all charged with robbery with aggrevating circumstances. She says they were linked to a heist that happened at the Dobsonville mall.
