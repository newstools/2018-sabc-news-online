Lawyers of suspended SARS Commissioner, Tom Moyane have confirmed that President Cyril Ramaphosa has responded to their letter of demands. They wrote to the president earlier this week requesting him to stop or disband the investigation into the Revenue Service. Moyane’s attorney, Eric Mabuza says he is pleased with President Ramaphosa’s response but that he will only divulge details after consulting with Moyane. On Monday, retired Judge Robert Nugent ruled against all requests made by Moyane, including a call for the suspension of the inquiry. Moyane’s legal team had argued that the inquiry was unfair and overlaps with his disciplinary process. The commission is investigating tax governance and administration issues at SARS and will reconvene in August.
