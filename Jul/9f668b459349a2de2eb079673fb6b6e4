The Democratic Alliance (DA) says it’s written to the Independent Electoral Commission to request an urgent investigation into whether the African National Congress (ANC) is using proceeds from crime to fund its election campaigns. This follows last week’s revelation that a former ANC employee at Luthuli House is a suspect in a cash heist in Soweto, and was arrested earlier this month. The ANC fired Velile Present last Wednesday when the news emerged. Police Minister Bheki Cele has also said that Present is allegedly linked to two other cash-in-transit robberies. DA spokesperson Solly Malatsi says the ANC may be funding its campaigns from illicit activities. ” The fact that an ANC staff member is being arrested linked cash intransit heist, creates a reasonable link between the prospect of the ANC using proceeds of crime for its elections. It is for this reason that we have written to the IEC calling for an investigation, to establish whether money that has been obtained through possible crime activities has not contributed to the ANC’s funding.”
