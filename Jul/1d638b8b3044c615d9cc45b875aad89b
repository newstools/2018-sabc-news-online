The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA)  has confirmed that an 80-year old man is expected to appear in the Johannesburg Magistrate’s Court on Sunday, relating to the murder of anti-Apartheid activist, Ahmed Timol. This follows the NPA’s issuing of an arrest warrant for Apartheid regime security policeman, Joao Rodriguez. He is believed to be 80 years-old. The NPA has refused to confirm that Rodriguez is the person expected to appear in court. Timol was arrested at a police roadblock on the 22 October 1971. He died five days later in detention. “We can confirm that an 80 year-old man is expected to appear in the Johannesburg Magistrate’s Court tomorrow (Monday), charged with murder and defeating the ends of justice. This is related to the Ahmed Timol case,” says NPA’s Phindi Mjonondwana.
