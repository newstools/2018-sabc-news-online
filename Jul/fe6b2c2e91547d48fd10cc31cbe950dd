Convicted serial rapist David Mamvura has been described as a calculating criminal who has no respect for women. The High Court in Polokwane has sentenced Mamvura to life imprisonment for the rape of 20 women and an additional 259 years for other crimes. The 27-year-old Zimbabwean national committed the crimes in around Polokwane between 2012 and 2014. Judge Francis Kganyago says Mamvura has never showed remorse for his actions. “Throughout the trial and even after his conviction the accused did not show any remorse. He continued to deny the charges despite the overwhelming evidence against him. The accused does not see anything wrong with what he did. With regard to the complaints regarding the rape charges, the youngest was 15 years while the oldest was 74 years and was old enough to be the accused grandmother. The accused has no respect for the elderly and he seems to have been enjoying what he was doing.” A second serial rapist was also sentenced Wednesday morning. The Bafokeng regional court in North West handed Ayabonga Ndai two life terms and an additional 206 years in jail for multiple crimes. Ndai was found guilty of crimes committed between 2010 and 2013, ranging from rape and attempted rape to armed robbery and house and business robbery in the Rustenburg and Boitekong areas. In most instances, he would force entry into women’s houses, then rape and rob them.
