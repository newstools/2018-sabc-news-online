The Road Accident Fund says it has reduced the time it takes to process funeral claims for road accident victims. KwaZulu-Natal Regional Marketing Manager, Nomkhosi Gumede says families can now make direct claims for funerals of those who died in road accidents. Gumede says the families can make claims before or after the funeral. “Basically what the Road Accident Fund has done now is to take the funeral parlours out of the mix and the families can now claim directly with the Road Accident Fund for a funeral claim. What that is going to do is to reduce the amount of time it’ll take for the claim to be processed thus allowing the families to go ahead with the funeral arrangements as quickly as possible.”
