Police say two suspected rhino poachers were killed in a shootout with a police anti-poaching team at Loskop Nature Reserve in Mpumalanga at the weekend. A police officer was wounded in the leg. Police were following up on an intelligence tip off about the poachers. SA Police Service (SAPS) spokesperson Vish Naidoo says the wounded police officer has been taken to hospital and he is in a stable condition. He says: “The two poachers were found in possession of a rifle fitted with a silencer and as you will know in recent years rhino poaching has been serious problem for us here in South Africa.” “We continue to call upon our communities to assist us in our effort to combat this crime against one of the most important species in our country,” adds Naidoo.
