The Inkatha Freedom Party’s (IFP) national leadership is meeting SABC management in Auckland Park, Johannesburg, on Wednesday. The IFP is complaining over what it terms unfair news coverage of political parties. The IFP claims the SABC is not giving it adequate coverage. Dozens of IFP supporters were protesting outside the SABC offices in Johannesburg. IFP Gauteng spokesperson, Sibusiso Phakathi says: “We are not being covered as an organisation. We don’t know whether it’s an agreement that has been taken. IFP is not being televised actually, even whatever good that we are doing. We deserve publicity as other political organisations, because we are all members of the community and we are all paying our licenses.”
