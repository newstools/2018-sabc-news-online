Various stakeholders in the management of Western Cape’s water crisis will meet again next month to assess current water restrictions. The national Water Department says the restrictions will remain in place for now despite the recent heavy rains. Level 6B water restrictions are in place in the City of Cape Town, one of the municipalities most affected by the drought. Department spokesperson Sputnik Ratau says average dam levels for the province stand at 54%. He says while this is encouraging, the figure is nowhere near the desired 85%. He says: “The question was whether we are in a situation to be able to lift the restrictions but coming out of that meeting decision was taken that the restrictions as they are will remain until we are able to see an improvement in the system as a whole.”
