KwaZulu-Natal police say four taxi drivers were critically wounded in Saturday’s ambush near Colenso that saw 11 of their colleagues shot dead. The drivers had come from Johannesburg to KZN to attend the funeral of their taxi boss at Matimatolo near Greytown. The head of the Alexandra-Randburg- Midrand-Sandton taxi association was killed in Johannesburg 10 days ago but it’s not clear if the funeral was for him. Provincial police spokesperson Jay Naicker says their detectives are at the scene questioning the surviving victims. “Unknown gunmen opened fire on the vehicle. From what we can tell, 11 people have passed away four critically injured and two of them were fortunate enough not to have sustained any injuries. The detectives are still questioning the survivors.” “Members of our taxi violent task team and provincial detectives task team are on the scene working with our crime scene investigators,” adds Naicker.
