North West Premier Job Mokgoro has warned that heads will roll in the province where the Hawks are continuing to investigate allegations of corruption. Mokgoro was speaking during his meeting with senior government managers in Mahikeng on Tuesday. He says the Hawks have been frequenting the province for some time and confiscating documents. Mokgoro says he’s prepared to clamp down on corruption in the province. He says: “Law enforcement agencies, particularly the Hawks, have been in and out of the province over the past three months. We will respect that process and allow it to run its full course. “At the same time I am in constant discussions with relevant ministers within the Inter-Ministerial Task Team process,” adds Mokgoro.
