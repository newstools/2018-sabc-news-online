Volunteer rescuers of the National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI) of Hermanus have assisted the Overberg municipality to tow a whale carcass to shore. Hermanus station commander, Deon Langenhoven says the eight-meter Humpback whale carcass was drifting in the sea off Bettyâ€™s Bay. He says the carcass was towed to a remote stretch of the coast between Hawston and Kleinmond and released in the shallow surf. The Overberg Municipality will monitor the whale carcass, which is expected to wash ashore and will arrange for the carcass be disposed of.
