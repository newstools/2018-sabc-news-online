Western Cape Police say they are making inroads in the fight against gang violence. Eight suspects have been arrested in two gang related incidents on Friday night. Police in Paarl seized an unlicensed firearm and ammunition after a shooting incident between gang members. Four arrests were made. In another incident on the same night, police on patrol in Stellenbosch arrested four men after observing them throw an object out of their vehicle in Cloetesville. Police spokesperson Noloyiso Rwexana says the officers took the suspects to where they threw the object and found a Vekto pistol with three 9mm rounds of ammunition. The suspects, aged between 19 and 34 years will appear in the Stellenbosch Magistratesâ€™ Court on Monday for the illegal possession of a firearm.
