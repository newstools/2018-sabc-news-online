Scholar transport operations in the Eastern Cape could be headed for a challenge due to increasing fuel prices. Operators have met with the Transport MEC, Weziwe Tikana, in East London, to iron out matters involving reviewing rates. South African National Taxi Council (SANTACO) chairperson, Noluntu Mahashe, in the Eastern Cape says the monthly fee they receive from the department to ferry learners to schools is insufficient to cover costs. “We propose that if she can help us at least add the money to compensate for the fuel escalation it will be better because we are struggling. We don’t have money for petrol, we don’t have money for parts because petrol is rising every day. Also, to help with the bad roads in this province because it’s in the rural area.” The proposal will be taken to treasury. Transport MEC Weziwe Tikana says they will submit a report to the treasury but that report will also include a request for extra funding for the learners that are not currently being transported. Parties are hopeful that this will not affect the ferrying of learners across the province for now. Watch the video report below:
