Farm dwellers and workers remain the most vulnerable people in the country. This is according to Rural Development and Land Reform Deputy Minister Mcebisi Skwatsha. Skhwatsha says government still needs to do more to improve the lives of farm workers and dwellers. Skhwatsha was speaking at an Imbizo at Valpoort in Armersfoort near Ermelo. He issued four title deeds to four households on the farm. He says the beneficiaries are among people whose tenure was insecure due to past discriminatory laws and practices. “It is a matter of all of us entering the new South Africa in the spirit of Madiba where we realise and recognise that we are all South Africans and we even have to be equal before the law.” “Every South African has a right to dignity, where it is not for the fact that some of us still live on farms that it will not necessitate that governments and Parliament to make laws to protect the tenure of people but because the is such a huge challenge. We have to embark on processing that makes sure that people are dignified in our country.” Click video below:
