E-hailing service, Uber has denied claims by some of its drivers that they have been blocked from using the company’s app. Uber says drivers that have been removed from the app have been found to be involved in illegal acts, including violence against other drivers. Drivers of the ride e-hailing services, Uber and Taxify claim they are now being victimised after taking part in this week’s strike action. They accuse Uber in particular of blocking them from using the App. On Tuesday, the drivers went off-line and marched to Uber offices in Kramerville in Johannesburg where they handed over a memorandum of demands. Uber says prior to the recent fuel hike it introduced an incentive to help minimise the impact of the fuel increase of drivers.
