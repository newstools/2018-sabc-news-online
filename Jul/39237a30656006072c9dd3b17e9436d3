The Galeshewe community near Kimberley is expected to meet Sunday afternoon to map out the way forward after two weeks of violent protests and looting. Angry residentsâ€™ shut down the city, calling for the resignation of Sol Plaatje municipal manager, Goolam Arkhawary, and Chief Financial Officer Lydia Matlhoko. The violent protests follow anger over the municipality wanting to introduce a R260 electricity tariff. The city of Kimberley was totally shut down and shops were looted two weeks ago. The community demands escalated to include the resignation of mayor, Mangaliso Matika. Both the municipal manager and the CFO have been placed on suspension, whereas the mayor has not indicated his intention to step down. The community earlier threatened that if their demands were not met by last Friday the shutdown will resume. Watch videos below:
