Police Minister Bheki Cele has written to Parliament requesting a six month amnesty period for illegal firearms. In his request Cele proposed that the amnesty period for illegal firearms be declared from the 1st of September until the end of February next year. The police minister’s proposal comes as the country reels from the killing of 12 people traveling in a mini-bus in KwaZulu-Natal over the weekend. Cele’s request is expected to be discussed by parliament’s portfolio committee on police next month. The committee’s chairperson Francois Beukman says he believes the proposed amnesty could potentially help reduce the number of firearms in circulation in the country As this is the biggest challenge for the police in fighting crime.
