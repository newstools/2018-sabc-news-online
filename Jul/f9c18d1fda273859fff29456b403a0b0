The ANC-led alliance has resolved to hold an alliance summit later this year. This as it works towards a reconfigured alliance. Alliance partners held a Political Council at the weekend which is the first since the ANC’s 54th conference in Nasrec in December. The alliance, which compromises the ANC, SACP, Cosatu and Sanco, had been on shaky grounds under the leadership of former ANC president Jacob Zuma. Partners complained of a lack of consultation when important decisions were taken. ANC secretary-general Ace Magashule says the summit will look at a range of issues with focus on the state of the economy. He says: “The meeting over the past weekend agreed towards the convening of an alliance economic summit. The summit will focus amongst others on proposals regarding the economic and labour market sections of the NDP.”
