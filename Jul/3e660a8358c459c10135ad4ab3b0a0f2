Southern Cape police are investigating the murder of an African National Congress (ANC) councillor in Knysna. The 47-year old Victor Molosi was gunned down outside his house in Concordia on Monday night. The motive is unclear, but community members suspect it to be politically motivated. On his way home from a School Governing Body meeting, Molosi was shot in the head and chest. He was rushed to hospital, but declared dead on arrival. His mother-in-law Vinolia Gungubele says:”It’s really a shock, we’re not coping. We never expected this from our area, Knysna. We’ve never seen this before. So it’s a big shock in the family, we’re angry, because we loved him and he was everything to us.” Described as a selfless and dedicated ward councillor, Molosi’s death is not only a loss to the ANC, but the community at large. ANC Sub-regional secretary Moyisi Magalela says:”Whenever we want guidance we would go to Victor. He will always guide us and remind us how things are done.  He believed in good values and principles.” Molosi leaves behind his wife and four sons, the youngest being eight-year old twins.
