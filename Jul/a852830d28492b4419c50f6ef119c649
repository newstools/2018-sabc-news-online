Police have dismissed as misinformation a claim that the number of people killed after this weekend’s taxi ambush at Colenso in KwaZulu-Natal midlands has risen to twelve. Police say this might be a ploy by some elements to get information on the whereabouts of the six survivors. Eleven people died in the ambush, four were wounded and two others were unhurt. The group was returning from a colleague’s funeral at Matimatolo in KwaZulu-Natal, when unknown gunmen ambushed them on their way back to Johannesburg. Police spokesperson in KwaZulu-Natal Jay Naicker says that death toll remains at 11. ” We can confirm that four injured victims are in an undisclosed location in hospital receiving medical attention. We are constantly kept up to date in terms of their condition and we want to dismiss any rumours that anyone of them has passed away. It’s not true.” Earlier, Ivory Park taxi Association chair on Gauteng’s East Rand, Johannes Mkhonza, said another person had died after the brutal shooting in KwaZulu-Natal, bringing the death toll to 12. Mkhoza described the ambush as a case of mistaken identity. Meanwhile, Police say security forces are continuing their investigations into the fatal shooting by unknown gunmen in KwaZulu-Natal over the weekend. “ We are very heavily reliant on where our investigations will take us, both in terms of establishing the motive as well as establishing who is responsible for the attack on Saturday night. Basically the plan is to mobilise resources from crime intelligence, the Hawks, general detectives, our special task force and other specialised units. These officers gather evidence, information and try to establish who is responsible for incidents like this one,” says spokesperson Vish Naidoo.
