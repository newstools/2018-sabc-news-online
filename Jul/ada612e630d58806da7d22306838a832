Former US President Barack Obama has arrived in Kenya, the birthplace of his father. This is his first visit to Africa since leaving office. He is there to launch the sports and training centre which was founded by his half-sister Auma Obama. Obama has already met with President Uhuru Kenyatta and is also expected to meet opposition leader Raila Odinga. In March, Kenyatta and Odinga ended months of turmoil, over a disputed presidential election, by reaching an agreement to work together. Obama will on Monday visit his late father’s home village of Kogelo in Siaya County. Obama’s next stop will be in South Africa where he will deliver this year’s annual Nelson Mandela Lecture on Tuesday afternoon in Johannesburg.
