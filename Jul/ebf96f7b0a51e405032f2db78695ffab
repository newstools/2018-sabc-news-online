The trial of truck driver Sebastian Macuacua, facing 18 counts of culpable homicide,  is expected to start on Wednesday at the Carolina Regional Court in Mpumalanga. The Mozambican national was arrested last year after two minibus taxis collided with his truck and claimed the lives of 18 people. He is currently out on R20 000 bail. Prior to his arrest, it was alleged that the minibus taxis were trying to overtake each other when the incident occurred. But upon his arrest, authorities claimed that Macuacua gave statements that contradicted those of the survivors. It was then alleged that he lost control of the truck and veered into oncoming traffic. During the bail application, Macuacua’s legal representative Themba Mkhwanazi revealed Macuacua will plead not guilty to all the charges against him.
