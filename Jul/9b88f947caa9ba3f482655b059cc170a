The Fuel Retailer’s Association has urged motorists to ignore the circulating social media messages warning motorists about the closure of fuel service stations on Friday. The Association’s CEO Reggie Sibiya says all fuel stations will be open as usual. He says fuel retailers have no association with the march against higher fuel prices. He has urged motorists not to panic. “I am responding to Whatsapp voice notes circulating around saying fuel stations nationally will be closed as part of protest against rising fuel prices. I hereby confirm that this is a rumour and there is no truth in it, all service stations will be operating in Friday so motorists must not panic.”
