President Cyril Ramaphosa has until 16:00 on Friday to respond to the legal team of suspended South African Revenue Service (SARS) Commissioner Tom Moyane. Moyane’s lawyers wrote to the President on Tuesday requesting him to stop or disband the investigation into the revenue service. Moyane’s attorney Eric Mabuza says if Ramaphosa fails to respond, they will approach a higher court. On Monday, retired Judge Robert Nugent ruled to reject all requests made by Moyane, including a call for the suspension of the inquiry. Moyane’s legal team had argued that the inquiry was unfair and overlaps with Moyane’s disciplinary process. The Commission is investigating tax governance and administration issues at SARS and will reconvene in August. Watch the video below for related news:
