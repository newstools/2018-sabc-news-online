Eskom has now cautioned there is a high risk of load-shedding this week, after saying earlier that its power stations were running normally. Nevertheless, the utility says the current industrial action at several power stations is impacting on its operations. Eskom says it will advise later if load shedding will be conducted at Stage 1, Stage 2, Stage 3 or Stage 4, depending on its capacity shortage. Stage 1 requires 1000 megawatts to be shed, 2000 megawatts for stage 2, and so on. Eskom has asked consumers to conserve electricity, with management saying it will meet with unions this Friday to discuss the deadlock over wages.
