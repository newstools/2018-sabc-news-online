The taxi driver accused of punching and trying to run over a JMPD officer will now face an attempted murder charge. Twenty six-year-old Khulani Dludlu was initially charged with assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm. Officer Nompumelelo Salley was controlling traffic at this busy intersection when she stopped Dludlu’s taxi. Dludlu is said to have refused to stop and give way to other vehicles. He apparently drove past yelling his displeasure at being stopped. He then alighted from his vehicle and punched the officer before trying to run her over. Dludlu’s charges have since been escalated and his bail conditions amended. The officer has been released from hospital. The JMPD has welcomed the developments. The matter has been postponed to the 28th of August. WATCH BELOW:
