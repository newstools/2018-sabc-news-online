Western Cape police say 35 people have been arrested on several charges, including two of attempted murder, possession of stolen firearms and public violence at Zwelihle Township in Hermanus in the Overstrand. The arrests happened on Friday. About 60 others were arrested earlier for violent protests in the area. On Thursday night, protestors attacked two members of the policeâ€™s public order policing unit and one of them was struck with an axe. Three firearms were stolen and two have since been recovered. Meanwhile amid the strong police deployment, Zwelihle is calm on Saturday. Police Minister, Bheki Cele, visited the area on Friday to meet with various stakeholders and address residents about their concerns. The meeting with residents at the local stadium fell apart after some of them stood up and left as Cele was speaking. They want him to release community leader, Ncobani Nzongana who was arrested last week. Cele turned down their request. Weeks of violent protests over housing and service delivery have led to the closure of schools and businesses. Related videos
