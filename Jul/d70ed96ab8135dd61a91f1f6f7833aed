The Independent Police Investigative Directorate (IPID) is to investigate alleged police brutality in Zwelihle Township in Hermanus in the Western Cape. Hermanus was brought to its knees in recent violent protests, prompting the Police Minister’s intervention. What started as a service delivery protest turned into a fight between police and the community as residents went on the rampage. Minister Bheki Cele returned to the area to listen to residents’ grievances. More police were brought in but they were also attacked and three fire arms stolen. Two have been recovered but one is still missing. While Cele has promised residents that police conduct will be investigated, he says violence will not be tolerated. “The leaders have promised to help find the gun. There have been complaints about police brutality and the IPID will be brought in.” Cele says he held discussions with all relevant stakeholders and if the situation in Zwelihle does not stabilise within a week, more police officers will be deployed.
