Home Affairs minister Malusi Gigaba says the new international migration white paper will go a long way to retain skilled migrants. This is in an effort to meet the scarce skills gap in the country. Speaking during a meeting with the Black Business Council in Sandton, Gigaba says the new international migration white paper adopted by cabinet last year has provided the department with an improved framework. Gigaba says South Africa has lost a large number of skilled migrants due to requirements in the old white paper. He says it required international students with a South African qualification to return their country of origin to apply for a scarce skills visa. He added that the documents issued by Home Affairs are important for economic development, because it means more people can participate in the economy and pay taxes. Gigiba says at least 60% of employees in South African companies must be South African to avoid unrest. He also says they are in talks with the trucking sector and others sectors to ensure compliance. The Minister  added that steps will be taken against sectors that don’t adhere to this requirement.
