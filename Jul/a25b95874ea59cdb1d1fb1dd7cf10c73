A large number of Economic Freedom Fighter (EFF) members have gathered at the Sisa Dukashe stadium in Mdantsane, Eastern Cape, ahead of the party’s fifth anniversary celebrations. The party’s leaders, including Commander in Chief Julius Malema, have been in East London since the beginning of the week to drum up support for celebrations. Roads leading to Sisa Dukashe stadium have been very busy since dawn with buses and mini buses  ferrying people to the stadium. Outside the stadium the colour red dominates as EFF members sing songs.  Some even spent the night outside the stadium. EFF members from Namibia and Zimbabwe will also join their South African counterparts. Malema is expected to address the event at midday. Click below to watch related video:
