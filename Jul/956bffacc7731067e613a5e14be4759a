The case involving former crime intelligence boss, Major General Pat Mokushane, his wife Zandile, Brigadier Leonora Bamuza-Phetlhe and Brigadier Tiyani Hlungwani has been postponed to December for trial. They appeared briefly in the Commercial Crimes Court in Pretoria on Friday. The four accused are facing charges of corruption, fraud and money laundering. The alleged offenses were committed in 2017 while Mokushane was the acting divisional commissioner of crime intelligence. Hlungwani and Bamuza-Phetlhe were working under his command at the time. It’s alleged that Mokushane falsified claims and payments worth thousands of rand. He also approved an application for an advance payment into Bamuza-Phetlhe’s account from the secret service. The payment was apparently facilitated by Hlungwani after he approached a colonel in the secret service. The four are out on R5000 bail. They’ll appear in court again on the 11th of December.
