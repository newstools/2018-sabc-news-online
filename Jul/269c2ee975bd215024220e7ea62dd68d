The African National Congress (ANC) says it’s dismayed at allegations that one of its employees has been arrested for serious crimes. Johannesburg Mayor Herman Mashaba says he was informed of the arrest of four suspects in connection with a cash-in-transit heist in Dobsonville, Soweto, earlier in July. He says he received confirmation that one of the four suspects was an employee at Luthuli House at the time of the arrest. ANC National Spokesperson Pule Mabe says an internal disciplinary process is being followed. “Crime remains a serious cancer in our young democracy and we must continue to fight it in whatever way it manifests itself.” “We support efforts by the law enforcement agencies to investigate, arrest and charge perpetrators for such high priority crimes. The ANC on its part is following the internal disciplinary policy for employees and will ensure appropriate action is taken.” Related video click below:
