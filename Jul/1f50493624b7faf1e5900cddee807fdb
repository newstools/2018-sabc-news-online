A suspect has been arrested near Mitchells Plain on the Cape Flats after he was caught with train electrical cables. The City of Cape Town’s Metal Theft Unit arrested the 32-year-old suspect from Khayelitsha after an officer spotted him rolling up a bundle of electric cabling. City spokesperson, Wayne Dyason, says officers caught the suspect who indicated that the cable was stolen along railway tracks between Stock Road Station and Mandalay. The officers checked the site and found a 300 meter long trench where the cable was removed. Prasa officials positively identified the 16 meter length of signalling cable as their property. This cable allows Prasa staff to track the movement of trains on the line and its removal would make this task impossible. This could cause major incidents on the line. The suspect was arrested and charged at Philippi East SAPS for possession of stolen property.
