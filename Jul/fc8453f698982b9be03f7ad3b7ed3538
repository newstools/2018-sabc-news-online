The Mpumalanga Legislature has sworn in a new member of the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF). Sam Zandamela replaces Alfred Skosana, who was expelled in May, for among other things, bringing the name of the party into disrepute. Tying loose ends ahead of the 2019 election, the EFF in Mpumalanga has replaced one of its two members. Alfred Skosana was expelled from the party for among others under-performance. He joined the party in 2012, and was sworn in as an EFF member of the provincial legislature in 2015. “He has dodged the levy two years ago and went to the national hearing and was found guilty and suspended for three years with a condition that he must not commit the same offence again within that period. He was found to be under performing and again he went to the media and spoke bad about the national media,” says Mpumalanga EFF leader Collen Sedibe. Zandamela joins Collen Sedibe who had been the sole member since the suspension and subsequent expulsion of Skosana. He promises to uphold the Constitution. “I am very much humbled by the opportunity that has been given to me by the party to come and serve the people. I come from local government and I want to continue,” says Zandamela. EFF hopes Zandamela’s experience will help champion the cause of the poor by holding the executive accountable.
