Democratic Alliance (DA) leader Mmusi Maimane has applauded the Nelson Mandela Bay Metro police for implementing and maintaining the shotSpotter, which is set to record the number of gun shots fired. He visited the gang-ridden Northern Areas in Port Elizabeth to see if the establishment of a satellite police station has had a positive impact on preventing gang violence. The metro has seen a 50% cent decrease in the number of gunshots fired, and an 11% decrease in injuries or killings. Maimane says the growing population in the metro means that more police officers are needed. “This particular area is unique in the sense that it has become a place where more people end up here for resettlement and it’s a community of diversity. As the numbers increase, there’s a disproportion at the level of allocation of policing resources. So you must appreciate that if you are going to fight crime, you need an increased proportion and that’s why we adjudicate how many police officers go into communities. We look at population numbers and then we add police to that. The South African government must ensure that more police are allocated to areas that are increasing.” Residents of the Northern Areas say they have also noticed a difference and are beginning to feel safer. “Of course there is a difference in terms of crime because of the shot spotters, after any shot, the response of the police is very quick, really there is a decrease in crime,” says one of the residents.
