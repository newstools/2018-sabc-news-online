The African National Congress in KwaZulu-Natal and Gauteng has announced new leadership. Both provinces held their elective conferences over the weekend. In KZN, Sihle Zikalala retained his position as chairperson and in Gauteng, David Makhura was also elected chairperson after acting in the position for months. Disgruntled members in both provinces approached the courts for interdict applications ahead of the conferences, which were later dismissed. Zikalala says branches have expressed unity and discipline within the ANC, “The manner in which the delegates conducted themselves was enhancing unity of the ANC, but also it is clear that all organisational  structures are committed to ensure that we take the ANC forward as we prepare for the 2019 general elections.” Zikalala says, “Unity is a process and we must make sure that we work together.” Watch full interview below
