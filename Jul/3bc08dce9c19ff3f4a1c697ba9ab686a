The South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) says they have resolved the technical issues that resulted in some grant beneficiaries not being able to draw out their money at ATMs. Sassa Spokesperson Kgomotso Diseko says all beneficiaries should now have access to their money. Frustration is expected to intensify as the Communication Workers Union embarks on a nationwide strike at Telkom and Post offices. Wage negotiations between the union and the two entities have deadlock. Diseko has urged all parties involved to resolve the situation as soon as possible. “We realised that notwithstanding the fact that we have paid money into everybody’s account  but some people are not able to withdraw that money and these people were about 700 000 in numbers.” “The problem was created by numerous technical problems which we have up to now resolved fortunately. At the end of business yesterday we had paid well over 72% of our beneficiaries.” “We do not foresee those difficulties recurring. We just hope the strike is avoided and the parties come to the table and resolve it as soon as possible.” Click video below:
