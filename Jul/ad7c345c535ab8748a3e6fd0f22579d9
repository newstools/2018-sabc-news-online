The African National Congress(ANC) president Cyril Ramaphosa has called on party members in KwaZulu-Natal to put their differences aside, and work towards re-building and uniting the organisation. The president was addressing delegates attending the party’s provincial conference at the Durban University of Technology. The party in the province has been embroiled in infighting, which resulted in court battles and cancellation of conferences in the province. “We should be able to have courage to work with people that we never thought we will ever be able to work with. Radical unity and renewal means that we should be able to work with people that we differ with, but you must be able to work with that comrade. You must also be able to work with comrade where ordinarily you don’t basically like each other and be able to sit down and work together,” the president explained. He has urged ANC members to accept the outcome of the party’s provincial elective conference and refrain from going to court. “Nobody should be tempted even to do so; this is a democratic process that has yielded this result.” “Let us accept it as a will of our people and you have resolved to build a strong movement. Comrade, this is a time to renew and rebuild the ANC and return it to the strength we are accustomed to,” he adds.  ANC KZN new PAC Sihle Zikalala has been announced ANC Chairperson in KwaZulu-Natal after he was elected unopposed.
