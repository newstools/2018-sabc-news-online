Three people have been shot, two of them fatally, in Bonteheuwel on the Cape Flats. Ward councillor, Angus McKenzie says one of the deceased is a pregnant woman and the other is an alleged gang member from the area. Last week, three people were shot and killed in separate incidents in the same area. McKenzie says shooting incidents have escalated in the last few weeks following the shooting of an alleged gang leader. “We have shootings taking place all around. We are aware of one alleged gangster that has been shot and killed. One pregnant woman in Assegai Avenue has been shot and killed and one lady has been shot and injured. It is all gang related shootings.”
