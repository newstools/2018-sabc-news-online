The Muslim Lawyers Association of South Africa has been turned down in their request to have India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi arrested when he attends the BRICS summit in South Africa next week. The Association’s request is based on a report by the UN about military atrocities by India in Kashmir. Modi is under pressure at home, facing a motion of no confidence coming up soon. The opposition will use this as an opportunity to make political gains ahead of next year’s general elections. The Prime Minister’s party will now have to prove its majority on the floor of the House and if it fails to win a majority, according to rules, the leadership will have to resign. Prime Minister Modi’s party the BJP is likely to win the vote but this is an attempt by the Opposition to embarrass the Prime Minister.   Muslim Lawyers Association vice chairperson Yousha Tayob, says they will continue with their efforts. “We will continue to engage with the NDPP. They have also requested substantially more evidence which we will gather for them in days to come so it’s not the end of it,” says Tayob. Watch the video below for the full story:
