Western Cape Premier Helen Zille says police have managed to stabilise the volatile situation at Zwelihle township in Hermanus. Zille has commended the police for arresting a number of people after two policemen were attacked at the township. One officer is recovering in hospital. Three firearms were stolen and two have since been recovered. The area has experienced ongoing violent protests linked to service delivery for two weeks. This led to the closure of schools and local business. Addressing a stakeholders meeting at the Overstand Municipality building in the town, Zille says police have prevented another Marikana. “The police have prevented another Marikana. There were a lot of people trying for another Marikana, and they arrested four of the ring leaders. We now have to find ways to get enough evidence to send them to jail for a long time,” says Zille. Meanwhile, residents have called for the release of community leader, Ngcobani Nzongana arrested last week. “The biggest problem is service delivery. Everything else happening here is the build-up from that. The municipality here is not treating people equally. Our community here is discarded. We are not known. It’s like there is no community called Zwelihle here. All the services focus on the white community … sorry to put it that way, but it’s like that,” says one of the local leaders Siyabulela Notwala.
