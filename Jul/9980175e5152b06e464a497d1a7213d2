Communications Minister Nomvula Mokonyane has unreservedly apologised to the public after the Social Security Agency (SASSA)failed to make payments to some beneficiaries of social grants. Mokonyane is in uMkhanyakude District Municipality as part of government imbizo aimed at addressing social challenges on the far northern KwaZulu-Natal. Hundreds of elderly and child grant beneficiaries across the country did not get payments as expected due to the payment migration process to the post office. Mokonyane says everything is on track. She says they have met with traditional leaders, community leaders and relevant stakeholders. “Part of what the South African government is focusing on is looking at government services particularly those that focus on the issuing of social grants, the migration from CPS to SAPO-SASSA arrangement. We have been to different site offices, we have seen people doing the swap cards – we have seen new applicants – we have interacted with traditional leaders and executives of the local and district municipality who all are really helping in making sure that beneficiaries of social grants do actually understand what is happening.”
