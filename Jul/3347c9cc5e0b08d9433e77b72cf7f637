The Supreme Court of Appeal has overturned a High Court ruling that called for the Deputy National Director of Public Prosecutions, Nomgcobo Jiba, and Special Director of Public Prosecutions, Lawrence Mrwebi, to be struck off the roll of advocates. They were struck off the roll in September 2016 after their decision to drop charges against former Crime Intelligence head Richard Mdluli, who was facing a number of charges that include defrauding a secret slush fund. In December, the High Court in Pretoria set aside the decision by National Prosecuting Authority boss, Shaun Abrahams, to withdraw charges against Jiba. Jiba was also not allowed to enter the NPA offices in Pretoria. The Â judgment was delivered by Justice Connie Mocumie in Bloemfontein. Watch for more:
