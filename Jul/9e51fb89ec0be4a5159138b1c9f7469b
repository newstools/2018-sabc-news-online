Community members and opposition parties are calling for the dissolution of the Kgetlengrivier Local Municipality in Koster in the North West, which has now been placed under section 139 1 {A} of the constitution. The municipality is now running without the mayor Kim Medupe, who has since been on the run, after her house and business apartment were set alight by angry protesters. Swartruggens community leader, Rammupudu Moeketsi says the situation will never change, until a new political leadership is appointed. “The council has dismally failed to govern Kgetlengrivier, what is in my view is the disbandment of the council, everybody must just pack their bags and go. Because what we hear clearly it’s a blame game between the mayor and other councillors. And what we know about this council it’s a plenary council, they take collective responsibility, all of them must just pack and go and the municipality must go for re-run.” Click below for a file video:
