An elderly suspect in the 1971 murder case of Anti-Apartheid activist Ahmed Timol is expected to appear in the Johannesburg Magistrate’s Court on Monday. The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) has refused to confirm the person as Joao Rodrigues. A warrant of arrest was issued for Rodriguez over the weekend. He was one of the security police allegedly involved in questioning Timol at their headquarters in the Johannesburg CBD. An inquest at the time found that Timol had jumped out of window to his death of his own accord. Timol’s nephew, Imtiaz Cajee, refers to another former security policeman who testified in the re-opened inquest last year: “I’ve been pursuing the matter of Neville Els and the feedback that I’ve been given by the NPA is that the investigation is continuing, and again it’s an urgent plea for them to fast track these investigations. Because nine months later they have still not appeared in a court of law, and as every day passes on, there’s a great chance of them passing this world – and without us getting closure,” says Cajee.
