The Democratic Alliance (DA), the Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (Outa) and other groups are to lead a march against what they call a high fuel tax levy in Pretoria on Tuesday. They have urged Tshwane Metro residents to join the march to the National Treasury, starting from Church Square at 10 oâ€™clock. Motorists have been hit by fuel price increases for several months in a row. The latest hike taking effect on Wednesday will be one cent a litre for petrol. The DA says that if the fuel levy of R5.30 a litre were reduced by 20%, fuel prices could return to around R15 a litre. Related video
