A three member delegation from the Democratic Alliance (DA)  has made an unannounced visit to Maseru Bridge. This was after a lot of calls of complaints from travelers using this port of entry. The long queues, ill treatment of travelers and extreme staff shortages have been a cause for concern at the port of entry. “Attitude is one of the key things and lack of commitment. But, you also have to understand that when people are understaffed, they don’t even have the resources to do their job, they are not even competent to do their job, that is a problem,” says DA’s MP, Patricia Kopane . On a recent visit to the border post, Home affairs Minister, Malusi Gigaba, also promised to introduce a ‘Trusted Travelers’ mechanism. Which aims to see easier movement of people and goods in line with the African Union Migration Policy. “It is clear that the ANC government immigration policy and border management plans are not working. You know because of the inconsistencies around different borders and you need far more efficient immigration services and border control to maximise even the economic benefits of the country,” says DA National Spokesperson, Solly Malatse. Maseru Bridge processes an average of 12 000 travelers a day and has 15 staffers per shift.
