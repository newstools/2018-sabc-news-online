The Galeshewe community in Kimberley in the Northern Cape has vowed to continue protesting until its demands are met. Violence erupted on Sunday afternoon at a meeting to map out the way forward after two weeks of violent protests and looting. The protests follow the municipality’s attempt to introduce a R260 electricity tariff. Community members are calling for the resignation of the Sol Plaatje Municipality Mayor, Municipal Manager and the CFO. Police used stun grenades to disperse an unknown group of people who disrupted the meeting. “We agreed here that the mayor must go, nothing has changed. If the mayor decides tonight in his sober mind if his conscience tricks him and he decides to resign today, tomorrow we’re going to call a community meeting where we will tell the community that the mayor has resigned. We don’t need to go to the streets, but for us everything that we must resolve we must first go to the streets then things are resolved,” says community leader Tebogo Obusitse.
