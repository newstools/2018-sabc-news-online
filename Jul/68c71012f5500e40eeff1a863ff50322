For two months now, the community of Ramokokastad near Rustenburg, North West, has been protesting against the current tribal council. The village has now come to a standstill with basic services including schools and health facilities being shut down. The community is demanding intervention from the provincial government. This village is at a standstill. No public transport, schools and clinics are closed and business is hardly operational. The community is unhappy with the leadership of the tribal council. “We are concerned about the running of the village by the so-called chief, whom together with his friends from the Baphalane belongings. So as I speak now, the situation is bad, there is a complete shutdown,” said Bosele Tsogang Engagement Forum’s Obed Tshegang. The situation has become so bad that surrounding villages are now affected. It’s been two months since the protest started, two weeks since school children are not going to school and two weeks since mineworkers are not able to get transport to go to work. “I wake up early not knowing if I will find transport to work. I hitch-hike and lose one hundred rand every day, said one resident.” “Let the Baphalane leave us out of their battles and allow our children to go to school,” added another resident. These villagers have marched to the union buildings twice, without any help. They’re now calling on the provincial leadership for intervention. The tribal council was not available for comment.
