An urgent intervention is needed to save Mpumalanga’s ailing health sector. Debt from previous financial years has accrued to R1 billion. This makes it difficult for the provincial health department to provide quality health care services. Health MEC Sasekani Manzini says she’s working with the premier to try and find solutions to the problem. Witbank hospital, built in 1910, is one of the oldest health facilities in the province, and now it is falling apart. Shortages of medication, staff and deteriorating infrastructure all pose a risk to patients and hospital staff alike. “We need funds and we have since met with different stakeholders to try and address these challenges, the premier has made a commitment to help,” says Mpumalanga Health MEC, Sasekani Manzini. As the country celebrates the Madiba legacy, youth residing in the vicinity managed by eMalahleni Municipality joined hands to try and provide the hospital with a facelift. They rolled up their sleeves, cleaning the premises, fixing potholes and painting some of the wards. “We said we must take time in the spirit of Madiba and make a contribution as young people in making a difference at this hospital,” says Emalahleni Municipality Councillor, Mduduzi Nkosi. The Health Department is optimistic that some of the challenges such as staff attitude will also be addressed. But some such as the shortage of staff and dilapidated infrastructure, even though urgent, might take a bit longer to address.
