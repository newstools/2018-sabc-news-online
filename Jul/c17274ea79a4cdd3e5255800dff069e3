The National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) is demanding changes to mining legislation after yet another miner was killed, this time at Harmony Gold’s Kusasalethu mine in Carletonville, west of Johannesburg. The miner was 2 km underground when a seismic event hit the site on Tuesday. NUM says this brings the number of fatalities at mines this year to above 45. The union’s Health and Safety Secretary, Sipho Mungwe says, “There must be amendments in the Mine Health and Safety Act because we have observed that there are many incidents that are happening and the employers are getting away with it. There must be this amendment, so that they can be prosecuted.” Last month, a miner died at the Sibanye-Stillwater‘s Khomanani mine at the Driefontein operation in Carletonville West of Johannesburg.
