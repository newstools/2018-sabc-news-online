Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema has taken a swipe at South African business mogul and President Cyril Ramaphosa‘s brother-in-law, Patrice Motsepe, saying he is leading another form of state capture. Malema was addressing the crowd at the EFF’s fifth birthday celebrations at Mdantsane in the Eastern Cape. He has warned that South Africa is not a banana republic. Malema referred to Motsepe saying he was not elected as the country’s president. “SA didn’t elect Patrice Motsepe as a president, he must know his place. He must sit down. We are not Motsepe’s people. He’s the brother in law of Ramaphosa and Jeff Radebe. They are capturing South Africa,  we want to warn Motsepe we are watching you in the same way we watched the Guptas,  stop doing what you’re doing, it’s unacceptable. South Africa doesn’t belong to the Motsepe family, there’s a new capture here. We are watching you, ask the Guptas about us.” Meanwhile, Malema has praised jailed AbaThembu King Buyelekhaya Dalindyebo, calling him a revolutionary king. “I want to give a special shout to our revolutionary King who is in prison, King Dalindyebo, you are with us in spirit. The criminals have locked you in prison and the real criminals are roaming the streets in Nkandla, those are the people who are supposed to be in prison, not our king.” Click below for more on the story :
