The City of Cape Town has condemned the torching of the Gugulethu Fire Station early Thursday morning. Firefighters were forced to vacate the premises and law enforcement agencies were called in to disperse protesters. The front of the station sustained severe damage. Mayoral Committee Member for Safety and Security, JP Smith says the damage will likely run in excess of a million rand. The fire station is closed until further notice. Smith says: “Our fire crews will be based at the Mitchells Plain fire station and will dispatch from there. What this means is that the actions of a few have put the lives of thousands of residents at risk as there will now be a delay in the response times to any fire callouts in the Gugulethu area.”
