The South African Weather Service says the cold front that has been experienced in most parts of KwaZulu-Natal, has now moved to North-Eastern parts of the country. This is after extremely cold weather conditions and rain were reported in most parts of the province over the weekend. Weather Forecaster Stacey Colborne says temperatures are expected to rise from Sunday. “We can expect cloudy conditions over KZN with a 30% chance of showers over the entire province. Tomorrow (Monday) we can expect a 30 % chance of rain and showers over the north-coast in the morning, other than that it’s going be a partly cloudy day over the province.”
