Cape Town mayor Patricia de Lille has confirmed reaching an agreement with the Democratic Alliance (DA) to start a disciplinary process to test all the allegations against her. This followed the withdrawal of the motion of no confidence against her during a council meeting in the Civic Centre. De Lille told journalists that the disciplinary process against her will be opened to the media and that three days have been set aside for the hearing next month. She says an exact date is still need to be set. “I look forward to appear before the DC committee. I have always asked for that, it’s finally going to happen now. We have agreed on a pre-conference trial before the hearing to make sure they produce all the evidence so that my lawyers can prepare my defence properly,” says De Lille.  One of the allegations is that she tried to interfere with the process of employing senior directors in the City of Cape Town. However, she says she was cleared by the City’s internal investigation. De Lille says an exact date for her disciplinary hearing still needs to be set. The motion of no confidence in De Lille was officially withdrawn in a council meeting in the civic centre. DA Councillor Marian Niewoudt withdrew the motion. “Thank you speaker for the opportunity to exercise my responsibility as the Councillor to express my concern and formalise my lack of confidence. It has come to my attention meanwhile that channels have been created which could bring the solution to the problem and I have decided to withdraw the motion.” The ANC in the City Council welcomed the decision. ANC caucus leader Xolani Sotashe says, “We really want to take this opportunity to say to Councillor Niewoudt as ANC we are not enemies here…” De Lille says she remains committed to serving the people of Cape Town.
