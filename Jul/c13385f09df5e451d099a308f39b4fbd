A 28-year-old man has appeared in the George Magistrate’s Court in the Western Cape. He’s been charged with being in possession of a cellphone belonging to a 25-year-old murder victim from Thembalethu. Hlompho Mohapi’s body was found last Thursday on a gravel road near Herold’s Bay. Her friends say she sent a text saying she was being threatened. Her family is critical of police investigations. Mzwandile Ntaka, Mohapi’s uncle says: “We as the family are very unhappy so far. We’re busy with funeral arrangements.  We hope the police will one day get back to us.” She was last seen alive getting into a vehicle on Thursday. It’s believed she received a job offer after a successful interview at George Airport. The airport has denied holding such an interview. The 28-year-old man was arrested in Knysna on Saturday. Police records show he’d been using Mohapi’s cellphone since her disappearance. He’s due to appear in court again on Monday for a bail application. WATCH BELOW:
