Deputy Minister of Transport  Sandisiwe Chikunga has defended the Road Accident Fund (RAF) at the 37th Southern African Transport Conference in Pretoria. Recently the fund came under heavy criticism over the R2 levy on the fuel price which goes to the RAF. Chikunga says if the RAF is removed, the liability will fall squarely on individual motorists after road crashes and for hospital costs of the injured parties. She says, “If we remove RAF it means somebody will have to pay. The person that caused the accident will have to pay and not government and not RAF. People are saying these things without looking at the downside of that, sometimes it’s about politics. In South Africa 250 people are dying per week, about 40 people dying per day.”
