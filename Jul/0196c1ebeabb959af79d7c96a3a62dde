Board chair of the Passenger Rail Agency of SA (PRASA), Khanyisile Kweyama, says she is still shocked after being hijacked near her home in Houghton, north of Johannesburg. She says she was bundled into the boot of her car and driven for over three hours before being dumped with the car in Katlehong, Ekurhuleni. Kweyama chairs the Board of Brand SA and sits on the Telkom and SABC boards. She says the police are investigating. “I’m still in shock you know. You are in a boot for about three hours and you have no idea what’s going to happen. At some stage these guys I think, I don’t know if it was a gun, because I could not feel it but they cocked it. They said they are cocking a gun and if you don’t behave we will shoot you. I’m still struggling to sleep because if I close my eyes I could see these guys’ faces. I’ll get over it,” says Kweyama. Meanwhile, Transport minister, Blade Nzimande has condemned the hijacking incident . Nzimande has called it a “scare and intimidation tactic” against Kweyama because of the work she doing and the progress she and her Board are making in turning PRASA around. Spokesperson for the department, Ishmael Mnisi says the minister will meet PRASA management and the Board to discuss this matter. “Minister Nzimande further said PRASA will continue to investigate all instances of maladministration, corruption and state capture, and insure that all involved are exposed and detained. Further more minister Nzimande said this despicable act will not be allowed in our democracy, where individuals with underhand motives want to intimidate individuals, acting on behalf of government from performing their responsibilities.” WATCH BELOW:
