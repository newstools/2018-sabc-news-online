The sister of former US President Barack Obama says her new training centre is a step towards providing quality education to the youth of Kenya. Obama will officially open the Sports, Resource and Vocational Training Centre while in Kenya. He landed earlier on Sunday. Speaking in an interview with SABC News, Dr Auma Obama says quality education should not only be about knowledge but about wisdom as well. “Education I see it in many different ways. I think education is about knowledge, it’s also about wisdom. One should talk about quality education and one should define what quality education is because just sending a child to school is not enough, what are they doing in that school?  So we have to have a bigger discussion about education and that’s what I would like to be part of and I’ve actually challenged our community, I’ve challenged our leaders and told them that is what I want to tackle now because I’m a value add to the education and I’m not going to substitute it. What the institution is supposed to do is create the right structures.” Click below for more on the story:
