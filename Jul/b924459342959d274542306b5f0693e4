Former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela  says social justice is about just and fair distribution of opportunities. Speaking during a public lecture titled “Social Justice Gap: Is the Constitution Responsible?” at the Nelson Mandela University, on Thursday evening, Madonsela says social justice is about equal distribution of resources and burdens in society. “In South Africa, the legal basis of social justice is our Constitution. I have often wondered why we have not been talking about social justice a lot. If you read the preamble to our Constitution, you will note that among the things that we dream of becoming is a democratic society that is based on social justice, where everyone’s life is improved.” The lecture is part of the Nelson Mandela University’s on going centenary celebrations.
