Public Works Minister, Thulas Nxesi revealed that his department lost R2 billion to fraud and corruption following an investigation by the Special Investigation Unit (SIU), while speaking at a career exhibition in Toli High School outside Lusikisiki in the Eastern Cape. Nxesi said his department has taken action against some of those involved in corrupt activities within his department. He said, “We have already expelled some people; some of the officials were expelled, some have appealed and they went to the CCMA. Some have lost, some are coming back but as long as there are people who have been fingered they need to answer for that. They need to be accountable and we can only do that by putting them through the disciplinary processes.” “If it means they have to be fired, they must be fired. So it ranges from giving warnings, deducting their salaries heavily and final warnings some times. In the first batch we did have disciplinary hearings. Now on the basis of the information which we have, we’re starting other disciplinary actions,” added Nxesi. He said the country needs to develop astute leaders to combat corruption in government. His department has adopted Toli High School through its program aimed at supporting learners from Grade 10 to Grade 12 with bursaries.
