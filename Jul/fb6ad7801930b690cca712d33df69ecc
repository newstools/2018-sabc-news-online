African National Congress Member of Parliament Mduduzi Manana will no longer be hauled before the courts to answer to allegations that he assaulted his domestic worker Christine Wiro. The National Prosecuting Authority says it will no longer be pursuing the case in court because it’s not winnable. Wiro had opened a case against Manana at the Dougalsdale Police station in May. She accused Manana of pushing her down a flight of stairs of his double-storey home in Johannesburg. Wiro later withdrew the case, but the NPA was intent on pursuing the matter. An audio clip also emerged believed to be Manana allegedly trying to offer Wiro R100 000 to drop the charges. Gauteng NPA spokesperson Phindi Mjonondwana,“We can confirm that as the NPA we have declined to prosecute Mduduzi Manana. The reason being that there were no prospects for a successful prosecution. It was charges of crimen injuria and assault.” Manana’s former domestic worker Christine Wiro says she’s saddened by the NPA’s decision in the case between her and Manana. “They’ve already made their decision, so I can’t say anything about it. It’s painful, but it’s fine. And myself  I’m gonna carry on with my life, and Mr Manana is gonna carry on with his life. But I’m feeling bad, feeling so sad.” Watch related videos:
