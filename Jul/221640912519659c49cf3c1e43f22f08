Members of the Police and Prisons Civil Rights Union (Popcru) will march to the Union Buildings in Pretoria on Friday. The march is over a number of issues in the Policing and Correctional services sectors. These include the restructuring of the South African Police Service (SAPS), nationalisation of traffic and an end to police killings. The Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) says its supports the march. “We are very concerned that our police officers continue to be killed; and we feel strongly as Cosatu that allowing such a situation to continue is a recipe for disaster and anarchy in this country. We will not be able to maintain social order if we do not really attend to the issues being raised by workers in the Security Cluster,” says Cosatu Spokesperson, Sizwe Pamla.
