Police are investigating a rape case after a patient was sexually assaulted at the Durban and Coastal Mental Health Care Centre. A doctor’s report has confirmed that a male patient at the centre was raped on Tuesday night. There have been reports of alleged exploitation and abuse of mental health patients at the institution. The facility which is funded by the Departments of Social Development and Health in the province says it is investigating the allegations. Health MEC Dr Sbongiseni Dlomo says during a visit to the centre they were aware of the allegations. “For it to be tabled to me, it was about a month… but both HODs have been on it longer than myself because before issues are raised with the MEC, they also on their own come to interrogate.” There is a structure called Mental Health Care review board – when they finish those investigations and they really make sure that such reports go to the HOD in the Department of Health… then the HOD will bring it to me. So I say HOD, if you think there is certain misdemeanour that you are picking up, please attend to that, investigate with your colleague HOD Social development and we will be ready to hear the final report of the investigation that has taken place,” says Dlomo.
