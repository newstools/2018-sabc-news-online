Human Settlements Minister Nomaindia Mfeketo has given the Auditor-General instructions to investigate conduct of the board and management of the Community Scheme Ombud Services (CSOS). The institution lost over R80 million of investment deposited in the controversial VBS Mutual Bank last year. The board and management of the CSOS said they had received the approval from national treasury to invest in VBS, a claim the Minister has disputed. CSOS was established in 2003 as a regulatory body and dispute resolution mechanism for community schemes. Itâ€™s also a legal recourse for community members to address matters concerning land.
