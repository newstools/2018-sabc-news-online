The Democratic Alliance (DA) has resolved to make proposals to government to reduce the levies paid to the Road Accident Fund (RAF) as well as the fuel levy to ease the burden of high fuel prices on South Africans. Earlier this month, Deputy Minister of Transport, Sindisiwe Chikunga defended the RAF after it came under heavy criticism over the fact that R1. 93 cents of the fuel price goes to it. South Africans currently pay just below R16 for 93-grade petrol and over R16 for 95 grade petrol. DA leader Mmusi Maimane has briefed the media in Johannesburg on the resolutions made by the party’s Federal Executive Council which met over the weekend to prepare for the 2019 elections. “The DA will also make proactive proposals to reduce the levy payable to the Road Accident Fund to provide immediate relief to consumers and to reduce the tax proportion payable on fuel over time to get it back to a reasonable level. This will ease the pressure on food and transport prices. “ Meanwhile, DA Shadow Minister of Cooperative Governance, Kevin Mileham has called for the expansion of the police investigation into corruption at VBS Mutual Bank to include two former Public Investment Corporation officials Paul Magula and Ernest Nesane. This follows media reports alleging that the two officials received bribes in excess of R5 million to ignore mismanagement at the bank. The DA laid charges against VBS executives and Vele Investments on Friday. Mileham says the allegations must be probed by police. “The Democratic Alliance has already laid criminal charges against a number of directors of VBS and Vele Investments, and we’ve also laid criminal charges against the municipal managers and CFOs of the affected municipalities. We will monitor the situation and, where needed, lay further charges so that we can ensure that those who are responsible for this breakdown in our financial institutions are held accountable to the full extent of the law.” Click below for more on the story:
