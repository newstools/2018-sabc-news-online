Africa National Congress (ANC) Provincial chairperson in Limpopo Stan Mathabatha says land expropriation without compensation will not affect land under the ownership of traditional leaders. Mathabatha said priority will be on the land under the white ownership. He made these comments while addressing ANC members at the regional elective conference of the party’s Waterberg region in Mokopane. The three day conference runs concurrently with another elective conference at the party’s Peter Mokaba region. Mathabatha has pleaded with ANC members to support the amendment of section 25 of the Constitution. Mathabatha said, “Let’s go out there and support the amending of section 25 of the Constitution, I think we all know or heard about this issue of the Ingonyama Trust in KZN the ANC has never said it is going to expropriate land under the ownership or possession of the traditional leaders. We have never said that our concentration is going to be the land that is under the white ownership.” Chairperson of the ANC Waterberg region in Limpopo Mauris Mataboge says ANC members who are involved in activities of manipulating tenders must be disciplined or either expelled. Mataboge was speaking at the party’s regional elective conference being held in Mokopane outside Polokwane. Mataboge added saying corruption is one of the worst crimes being committed by party’s leadership. “Stealing from the people through corruption is one of the worst crimes a cadre can commit, we have to respect democratic processes of the country and the ANC. ANC members who are involved in activities like manipulating tender processes or lying about their own achievement are liable to be disciplined and may face expulsion,” added Mataboge.
