Higher Education minister, Naledi Pandor has praised the late struggle stalwarts Nelson Mandela and Albertina Sisulu for their contribution in liberating the country. She’s been speaking at the handing over of two residences at the King Sabatha Dalindyebo TVET college in Mthatha in the Eastern Cape. The two residences for males and females have been named after the two late veterans. Pandor says Mandela and Sisulu gave their lives for the country. She says: “Our government has said we must celebrate Nelson Mandela this year and of course mama Albertina Sisulu because they did everything for our country and everything for our freedom.” “They could have been anything, they could have chosen any path but they chose the path of righteousness, justice and of freedom,” she adds.
