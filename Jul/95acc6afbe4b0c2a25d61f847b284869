The South African Weather Service says cold weather conditions and rain are expected to persist throughout the weekend in most parts of KwaZulu-Natal. Forecaster Julius Mahlangu says temperatures are expected to get warmer by Monday. “We also expect cold conditions across the province but very cold over the south western part of the province. Those include areas like Underberg, Kokstad, the areas around the Drakensberg and that’s where we’re also expecting light snowfall and rainfall tonight.” “Tomorrow we’re expecting 30% chances of some rain and showers across the province – but 60% over the coastal areas of KZN. Cold conditions are also expected to persist into tomorrow, but then on Monday the rain fall is only expected in areas north east of the province, including areas like Richards Bay, Nongoma and Mkhuze. The temperatures are expected to slightly increase from Monday,” explains Mahlangu.
