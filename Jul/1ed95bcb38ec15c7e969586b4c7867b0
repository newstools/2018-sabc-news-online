The North West Health Department and the previously Gupta -linked Mediosa  Company are battling over R 24 million of taxpayers’ money paid to the company. Mediosa’s lawyers say the company did render the services for which the department was billed and that they will explore all legal avenues to retain the money. However, Health MEC Magome Masike’s Spokesperson, Tebogo Lekgethwane says they will be carefully checking Mediosa’s R 24-million of invoices, among other measures. Lekgethwane says, “MEC Dr Masike indicated that there are a few things that the department will have to do to recoup money from Mediosa. One is that the company has sent invoices of R24 million which tries to explain how they are claiming the money, in terms of the work that has been done but they will have to verify the invoices against the work done.” “If at all the reports do not satisfy the department in terms of the work done, the money will have to be deducted,” he adds.
