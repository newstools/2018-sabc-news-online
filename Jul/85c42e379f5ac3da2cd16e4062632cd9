The Democratic Alliance (DA) has slammed government for failing to protect consumers from the negative impact of the high fuel and vat hikes. This is amid rising concerns that the increases could adversely affect the poor and low income earners. Last week President Cyril Ramaphosa announced that government will unveil new measures to ease pressure on food and transport prices. The DA has also proposed a raft of measures which include amongst others, the reduction of the levy payable to the Road Accident Fund to provide immediate relief to consumers. Briefing the media after the DA’s Federal Executive Committee meeting in Johannesburg,  party leader Mmusi Maimane accused the ANC led government of not implementing viable solutions to reduce the high cost of living amongst the poor and vulnerable communities. “There can be no doubt that when you are poor in South Africa you end up with your pockets being empty. We have resolved this week that there is no clear demonstration of leadership within the ANC that they want to deal with corruption.”
