Western Cape Premier Helen Zille has welcomed the Gauteng High Court ruling which interdicted the implementation of the remedial action from the Public Protector’s report on her controversial tweets that the legacy of colonialism was not always bad. Last week, Zille launched the challenge of the report after Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane found that Zille had violated the Constitution and the executive ethics code by her comments. Mkhwebane recommended that Zille be sanctioned by the provincial legislature. However, now the court will have to deal with the review application first. Zille has welcomed the ruling. “I’m obviously pleased with the ruling; it basically suspends the implementation of the recommendation in the Public Protector’s report until the review application has been heard – that is now going with the outcome.” Click below for more on the story:
