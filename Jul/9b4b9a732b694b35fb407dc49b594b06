The Constitutional Court will on Thursday, hand down judgment on the labour brokering case. The outcome will determine whether casual workers who are in the employ of labour brokers are deemed permanent by the main employer after three months or not. Metal worker’s union National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa is the applicant in this case which was heard by the court in February. Numsa spokesperson Phakamile Hlubi-Majola says this labour practice should not allowed. “It’s a common fact that Numsa has been at the forefront of fighting for labour brokers to be banned. We believe that this form of modern day slavery should not be allowed, if the constitutional court agrees with out interpretation of the labour law this will be a major step in ending this form of abuse. It will guarantee the rights of temporary workers and allow them to access decent salaries and benefits just like permanent staff automatically after three months.”
