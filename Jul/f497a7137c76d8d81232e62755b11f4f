The Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) has cautiously welcomed the decision by President Cyril Ramaphosa to set up an economic cluster ministerial committee panel to come up with plans to mitigate the impact of the high petrol and food prices on the country’s citizens. Addressing the BRICS business breakfast in Pretoria, President Cyril Ramaphosa appealed to businesses not to hike prices in response to the fuel price increase and urged them to await government intervention. Earlier, Energy Minister Jeff Radebe said government will explore various means to cushion South Africans against more fuel price increases. Cosatu president Sdumo Dlamini has urged President Ramaphosa to act swiftly in reducing the high cost of fuel and food prices to alleviate the negative impact on poor and working class citizens. “The country and the society is very worried that this life conditions are getting tougher.  But we are encouraging him to be bold and lower the cost of living.  The fuel hikes have to go down; the petrol levy has to be reviewed. It’s an urgent situation confronting us.” Click below for more on the story:
