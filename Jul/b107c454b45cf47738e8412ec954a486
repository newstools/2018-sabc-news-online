Limpopo premier Stan Mathabatha has secured R100 billion investment from China for the province. Mathabatha has just been on a week-long investment trade mission in China where he signed memoranda of understanding with different regions. Provincial government spokesperson Phuti Seloba says,“We have been to the province of Shangshi, we have been to Hanang. We manage to have about two trade seminars where we showcased Limpopo projects, but we also came to cement the relationship that we have started. We came to a company that reaffirmed its commitment to invest more than a R100 billion in the Musina-Makhado ECZ, because this project is no longer a dream, it is a reality. We need 20 000 plus people of this province to get jobs.”
