Gautrain commuters have been warned of delays and limited services due to workers going on strike from Monday morning. This comes as wage negotiations between the Bombela Concession Company, the operator of the Gautrain, and the United National Transport Union reached a deadlock. The Bombela Operating Company has offered an 8% salary and benefit increase, while raising the minimum wage to R8500. However, the union wants an increase of 19 .5%. “We have developed a contingency plan to operate a reduced service, starting at 05:45 tomorrow (Monday) morning. Passengers can expect extended journey times on some trips, and we would like to apologise for any inconvenience. For details on the contingency plan, please visit the Gautrain website. Additional security measures will be implemented on the Gautrain system and the safety of passengers will not be compromised at any time,” says Gautrain spokesperson, Kesagee Nayager. –  Tshimo Maputla
