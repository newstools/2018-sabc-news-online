The African National Congress (ANC) Provincial Executive Committee (PEC)  in North West is planning to take disciplinary action against members who convened and attended the parallel regional conference at the Dr Ruth Segomotsi Mompati in Taung. The PEC says the members will be brought to book. This after two parallel conferences took place in one region over the weekend. The conference which was sanctioned by the party’s provincial leadership was held in Christiana, whilst the  second conference was convened by disgruntled members in Taung. Other ANC members argued that the majority of legitimate delegates were denied access to the official conference. Provincial spokesperson Gerald Modise stressed that there is only one conference recognised by the PEC. He further emphasized that those who attended the Taung conference will face an internal disciplinary process. “As far as we are concern, there is no parallel conferences that were convened and sanctioned by the PEC. It can’t be like that. There is only one conference that is legitimate. It’s the one that was held at all seasons resort in Christiana. It is against the norms and standards and principles of the ANC and they have to be taken to task by invoking the prescripts of the constitution of the ANC.” The Taung delegates maintain that their conference was legitimate and say they will not be intimidated by the provincial leadership.
