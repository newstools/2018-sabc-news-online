Former US President, Barack Obama says there needs to be more women empowerment across the continent which could lead to better policy making. This as South Africa celebrates the 100th anniversary of Nelson Mandela’s birth. On Tuesday Obama delivered the keynote address at the annual Nelson Mandela lecture. Engaging with youth in Honeydew, Johannesburg on Wednesday Obama jokingly criticised some men who choose to make harmful decisions. He says: “Women in particularly by the way, I want you to get more involved because men have been getting on my nerves lately. I mean every day I read the newspaper and I think, brothers what is wrong with you guys? What’s wrong with us? We are violent, we are bullying, we are just not handling our business. So I think empowering more women on the continent, that ought to lead to some better policies.” Obama went on to outline various ways that youth can become involved in politics and leadership in a sincere and non-corrupt way. He suggested that young people research which sector of governance they would prefer to become involved in to create positive change. “If you are ambitious about what you are doing in your home country you will confront politics. Then the question becomes how do I want to engage it, do I want to run for office? Some people have the personality to be able to do that. Other people say I don’t want to run but I want to help organise and manage the efforts of people I think are sincere and have integrity.” “Some people may be journalists and hold politicians accountable, all that is contributing to the quality of governing. So you don’t have an excuse to say this is too corrupt and I am going to be selling my soul. Find a way where you are not selling your soul, ” adds Obama. Related video below: Nelson Mandela Lecture
