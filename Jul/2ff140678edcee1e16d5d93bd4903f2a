Eskom whistle-blower Suzanne Daniels has been dismissed after a disciplinary hearing found she was implicated in some of the questionable transactions at the power utility. An independent inquiry headed by Nazir Cassim found Daniels guilty of four charges. These are: the distribution of confidential Eskom information to a third party; involvement in the McKinsey and Trillian consulting transactions and involvement in the Tegeta transaction in which Eskom helped the Gupta family buy the Optimum mine. Daniels was a key figure in the parliamentary hearings on Eskom last year providing evidence against former executives Brian Molefe and Anoj Singh. She turned whistle-blower after she was suspended by Eskom.
