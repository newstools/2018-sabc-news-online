Former Denel board chairperson, Daniel Mantsha has been appointed former president Jacob Zuma’s new attorney. Mantsha is a well-known Gupta associate.  He was appointed as Denel chairperson in 2015 until March this year. Zuma fired his long time attorney Michael Hulley and terminated his legal brief two weeks ago. Hulley represented Zuma at his 2006 rape trial, and saw Zuma through more than a decade of the spy tapes saga. In two weeks’ time, Zuma will be back at the Durban High Court where he is facing charges of corruption relating to the multi-billion rand arms deal in the 1990s. Analyst Xolani Dube says, “It’s always kind of surprising for Michael Hulley to part ways with his client, who has been with him through thick and thin.” Dube adds, “It’s a very interesting choice because Daniel was mainly involved in that Denel-Asia joint venture between Denel and the associates of the Guptas. So one is asking why such a move from a president who is going to be fighting the issue of state capture? Why is he choosing someone who is tainted by such kinds of allegations?” Click below to watch related video:
