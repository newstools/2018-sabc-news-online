Duduzane Zuma faces an additional charge of negligent driving when he appears in the Randburg Magistrate’s Court on Thursday. The charges relate to a 2014 collision with a taxi, which resulted in two deaths. The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) had initially declined to prosecute, despite an inquiry finding that Zuma’s negligent driving had led to the fatal crash. It reviewed the case after lobby group, AfriForum, threatened to pursue the matter through a private prosecution. This is the first time that Duduzane Zuma will appear in court for the 2014 crash. He faces two counts of culpable homicide for the deaths of taxi passengers. That accident killed Phumzile Dube, who died on the scene and Nanke Janet Mashaba who succumbed to her injuries later. Zuma faces an alternative charge of negligent driving, yet his court appearance is expected to last only a few minutes. The State is expected to ask for a postponement.
