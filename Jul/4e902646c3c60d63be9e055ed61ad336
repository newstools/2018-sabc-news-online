This year’s annual Knysna Oyster festival attracted thousands of visitors. The festival did not only focus on Oyster tasting but also on uplifting local entrepreneurs. Three local entrepreneurs were given sponsorship to host events during the festival. Melvin Mene’s oyster hotspot gives visitors a township experience, with a touch of fine-dining. He says though his business is still struggling, he is getting support from the Kynsna tourism and locals. Bulelani Memane, another spotlighted entrepreneur, says he received double the support he had anticipated. “My event was the colour splash. I expected about 450 people, i had close to 900 people attending that event, the outcome was big,” says Memane. The festival once again attracted thousands of visitors, many of whom participated in the various sporting events, such as the Big 5 Challenge. The challenge consists of a cycle tour, lagoon swim, trail running, mountain biking and a forest marathon. “I feel really stoked. It’s been a long week.  We started last week Saturday with the 80km mountain bike and racing throughout the week.  It’s a long event but it feels good to be done,” says Keegan Cooke, Big Five challenge winner. Each year millions of rands are raised at the Oyster Festival for local charities. Watch the video below for the full story:
