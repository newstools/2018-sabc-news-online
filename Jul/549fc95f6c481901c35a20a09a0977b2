Social Development minister, Suzan Shabangu says progress has been made in changing  Sassa cards. She has made a plea to social grant beneficiaries to change their cards before the end of September. Shabangu says beneficiaries, who still use Cash Paymaster Service cards, will encounter problems with their payments by the end of September. The minister visited the Sassa service point in the city of Matlosana in Jouberton in the North West, to monitor progress with regards to card swapping. The South African Post Office, has taken over the distribution of social grants from the controversial cash paymaster services. Minister Shabangu says to date progress has been made, and pleads to those who have not yet changed their cards to do soon. “It is very interesting because today is not a pay day but lots of people are here to do the card swap . and it’s very critical and important for them to do that because the court has given us up to September to terminate our relationship with CPS. So that is what we are doing, the way they are responding is very exiting but it also says our people are ready to move into our new system.” “Part of coming here is to apologize to our people. For what happened last month. It was not intentional, we had technical clinches that we have dealt with, and we are happy now that we are making progress,” says Shabangu. She says they are pleased that the systems at  Jouberton are working better and faster and it takes two minutes to process a card. Watch the video below for more on the story:
