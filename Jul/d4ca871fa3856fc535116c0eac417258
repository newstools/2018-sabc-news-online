The High Court in Polokwane will on Wednesday sentence a 27-year-old man found guilty of 30 counts of rape, attempted murder, house-breaking and robbery. Judge Francis Kganyago ruled that the state proved beyond reasonable doubt that David Mamvura, a Zimbabwean national, raped more than 20 women. David Mamvura committed the crimes in and around Polokwane between 2010 and 2014. Judge Kganyago has ruled that Mamvura, who represented himself, provided no evidence to counter the state’s case. He also emphasised that the court was left with no choice but to take the state witnesses’ versions of events as most of them were not cross-examined. Mamvura testified in mitigation of sentence. He told the court that he found the entire court proceedings unfair on him. He also requested leniency saying that he was the sole breadwinner with six dependants.
