Public Service and Administration Minister Ayanda Dlodlo says she hopes the 100 Men March will not be a once-off event but will signal the start of ridding the country of the scourge of violence against women and children. She, together with Police Minister Bheki Cele and Communications Minister Nomvula Mokonyane participated in the march in Pretoria. Mokonyane and the Tshwane Executive Mayor Solly Msimanga are addressing the marchers at the Union Buildings. The men will also take a pledge to speak out, protect and teach the people in their care not to be violent against women and children. Dlodlo says she is positive the march will have a lasting effect because it is led by men. Earlier, Cele admitted that the police sometimes do not act appropriately when domestic violence and gender abuse cases are reported. He said that not all police officers are rotten apples and that the cadets were brought to take part in the march to learn and appreciate the importance of working with communities.
