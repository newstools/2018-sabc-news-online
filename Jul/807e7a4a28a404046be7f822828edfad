Pan Africanist Congress (PAC) President Narius Moloto has called on all expelled members of his party to come back home. Infighting in the party has seen some prominent members kicked out after disciplinary hearings against them. The PAC support base has been dwindling since 1994. Divisions within the PAC continue to widen. Expelled former presidents, Letlapa Mphahlele and Luthando Mbinda are believed to be considering forming splinter parties. Moloto says, “…the issue we have is for them to use the PAC logo and the name of the PAC. The issue that is there, is the question of that if they want to re-join the party, they must come as individuals, not as a group.” Despite his expulsion from the party, Mbinda still serves as a PAC Member of Parliament. Moloto says the Speaker has been requested to release him and that if this doesn’t happen, the party will approach the Constitutional Court to resolve the issue. The PAC NEC also recently resolved to fully support land expropriation without compensation. The party wants the process to be fast-tracked. Moloto says, “We are extremely happy with the current debate, and also the participation of the masses of our people. We know that it’s not everybody that is having the capacity. We also call upon on the political leaders not to ‘stuck’ the land debate. They must begin to present different scenarios on what land redistribution will mean.” The PAC leadership is confident it will perform relatively well in the 2019 general elections.
