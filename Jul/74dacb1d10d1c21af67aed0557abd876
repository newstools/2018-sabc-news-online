The high court in Johannesburg will Monday morning deliver judgment in the so called Grace Mugabe immunity case. The matter relates to the 2017 decision by the then international relations minister, Maite Nkoana-Mashabane, to grant the former Zimbabwe’s first lady diplomatic immunity. At the time, Mugabe was accused of assaulting model Gabriella Engels at a hotel in Johannesburg. The case was initially heard in Pretoria, but has now been moved to Johannesburg. The Democratic Alliance (DA) and AfriForum have asked the court to set aside the government’s decision, on grounds that it was illegal and unconstitutional. The DA believes that Mugabe was granted immunity simply to shield her from being tried in a court of law for her assault on Engels and two others on 13 August 2017. It says condoning such behaviour, as the granting of immunity did, cannot possibly be in the interests of South Africa. WATCH RELATED VIDEO BELOW:
