Platforms 13 and 14 at Cape Town station will remain closed on Tuesday while repair work is underway. Crews started on Monday with repairs of the overhead electrical cables and signals after Saturday’s train fire. Three coaches were lost in that incident. Trains usually departing from those platforms will be rerouted to other platforms. Delays are expected again on Tuesday on the rail network, especially on the Northern line between Cape Town, Kraaifontein and Wellington. Fifteen coaches were lost in three separate suspected arson attacks last week, taking the total tally of coaches lost since May 2015 to 149. See related tweet below:
