An automated and paperless programme for birth, marriage and death registrations at Home Affairs offices will eradicate corruption. Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba made the statement while briefing the media about the rolling out of a flagship programme of modernisation. The programme is expected to be implemented in phases until all Home Affairs offices are fully digitised. Snailing queues and corrupt officials at Home Affairs offices is expected to be a thing of the past. Home Affairs is on the verge of rolling out phase one of an automated paperless system for birth, death and marriage registrations. “The upgrade is part of on-going enhancements to improve services and modernise processes. Documents will now be saved electronically and will be easily retrieved upon request,” says Gigaba. The Home Affairs department dismissed fears that the new system would compromise security. The programme is expected to be fully operational following a major system upgrade commencing on Friday. The upgrade will affect 184 modernised offices, out of the total 411 Home Affairs offices. The programme was initiated in 2010 following a tender to the tune of over R2.2 million.
