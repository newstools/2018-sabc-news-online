Media Monitoring Africa  (MMA) says the media has neglected to investigate and inform the public what the terms and conditions of the Chinese investment in Eskom are. The Bank of China has secured a 30-billion-rand loan agreement for the power utility. This is part of the 191- billion-rand investment that the Chinese government has committed to South Africa. About a week ago, Eskom announced that it had made a two-point-three-billion-rand loss in the 2017/18 financial period. It also revealed irregular expenditure of almost 20-billion-rand since 2012. Media Monitoring Africa Head of policy programme, Thandi Smith says , “I do think that we can go far more into unpacking the issues and the agreements a lot better. I think that we’re sort of obsessed with your celebrity politician, and that’s I think quite common, but that also links to the issues that we see – the tiny deals – our President securing these deals.” Watch related video below:
