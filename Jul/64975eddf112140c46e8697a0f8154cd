Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema has used his address at the fifth anniversary celebrations of his party to praise the people of the Eastern Cape for their contribution to the struggle against apartheid. He was speaking at the Sisa Dukash Stadium at Mdantsane near East London. Malema says the province produced such leading struggle figures as Robert Sobukwe, Chris Hani, Steve Biko and Winnie Madikizela-Mandela. He says the struggle of the people of the province is still not over. “We are happy to be with the people of the Eastern Cape, because you are important people in our lives. You occupy an important place in the heart of the EFF. You are important because of your contribution to the struggle of the emancipation of our people. We are proud that this province produced the mother of the nation, Winnie Madikizela-Mandela. We are inspired by Winnie Madikizela-Mandela.” He said the EFF will fight for those who receive social grants, to be exempted from paying electricity. Malema also lambasted the African National Congress (ANC) government, insisting that a lot of municipalities are dysfunctional. He said the majority of people in the province are struggling and unemployed. “Here in the Eastern Cape we’ve seen politicians stealing money for toilets. Don’t look far just go to the cabinet which is called a new dawn. A new dawn cabinet full of politicians who stole the money for toilets, if you don’t know a pit toilet in schools just tour the Eastern Cape you’ll see what a mud school looks like. You’ll see how a mud school looks like because here in the Eastern Cape our people have been neglected.” Click below for more on the story:
