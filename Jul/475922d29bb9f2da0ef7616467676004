Political analyst, Xolani Dube, says the case against former president Jacob Zuma has the potential to expose several corrupt political figures. Zuma’s supporters have begun to arrive at the High Court in Pietermaritzburg ahead of his court appearance later this morning. Zuma is facing charges including fraud, racketeering and money laundering, emanating from the controversial multi-million arms deal that happened in 90s. Last month, the case was postponed. The adjournment was aimed at affording Zuma’s co-accused, a French manufacturing company time to make representations to the National Director of Public Prosecutions (NDPP) as to why it should not be prosecuted. Speaking on Morning Live, Dube says: “This case is highly politically polluted and I think the judiciary is supposed to deal with it in a very careful manner because it will set as an example for future cases.” This case has got far reaching effects if Jacob Zuma is going to be found guilty. “I don’t think that Zuma will simply allow himself to go down alone and so I think he will pull everyone down so everyone will be exposed in this case,” adds Dube.
