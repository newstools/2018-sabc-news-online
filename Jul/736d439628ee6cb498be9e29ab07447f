The ANC in KwaZulu-Natal says it will not expropriate land which is under the control of traditional leaders and the Ingonyama Trust. This emerged at the party’s one-day land summit in Durban. The party says its focus is on commercial land. There are mixed feelings among political parties and traditional leaders in respect of the expropriation of land without compensation. “Our focus is on expropriation of land for commercial reasons. It is not true that we want to expropriate land under Amakhosi. Our main focus is commercial land – and that is land we believe can make changes in people’s lives – and we need to make changes… We discuss the land in the context of economic transformation, especially when it comes to agricultural land. It is not about rural land and land in the township,”says Sihle Zikalala, convenor of the ANC in the province. Zikalala has denies reports that they have changed their tune after talking to different communities about the land issue. “We are not changing our stance – and we are very clear on the issue of land… And we remain steadfast, nothing else. Those who say we want to take land under Ingonyama trust, they are saying their own issues. It is not true that we are afraid of the king… instead we engaged him to discuss the matter. We are still clear… That the land that needs to be expropriated land is the land that is in the hands of commercial farmers… even the high level panel did not engage the House of the Traditional leaders.” Watch video below:
