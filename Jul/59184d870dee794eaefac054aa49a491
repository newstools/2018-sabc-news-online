Two men have been arrested for possession of unlicensed firearms and a hijacked vehicle in Hillbrow in Johannesburg Thursday morning. Police spokesperson Kay Makhubele says the armed suspects, who were arrested, could be linked to other crimes. The Johannesburg flying squad got a tip off of a vehicle parked on the corner of Twist and Pretoria street in Hillbrow. When they approached the vehicle they found two males who were armed with two rifles and one pistol. It was also found that the vehicle, a Mercedes Benz, was hijacked in Phola, Mpumalanga, last year July.
