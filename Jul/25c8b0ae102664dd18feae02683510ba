Violence has erupted at the Galeshewe community meeting near Kimberley, where residents were expected to map out the way forward after two weeks of violent protests and looting. An unknown group of people disrupted the meeting creating chaos and police fired stun grenades to disperse the crowds. Angry residents shutdown the city, calling for the resignation of Sol Plaatje municipal manager and CFO. This city was shut down for two weeks. The violent protests follow anger over the municipality wanting to introduce a R260 electricity tariff. Community demands escalated to include the resignation of mayor, Mangaliso Matika. Both the Municipal manager and the CFO have been placed on precautionary suspension. The mayor has not indicated his intention to resign. The community earlier threatened that if their demands were not met by last Friday, the shutdown will resume.
