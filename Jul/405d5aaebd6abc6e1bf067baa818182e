The African Union Free Trade Agreement is aimed at uniting the continent at Economic level. At political and cultural level, a lot needs to be done for Africans to accept each other irrespective of country of origin. An activist from Togo, Farida Bemba Nabourema penned down a scathing article after treatment she and other activists received upon arrival in South Africa for a summit. In the article, Nabourema maintains that an itinerary note received by delegates to the African Youth Network Summit reading “Any delegate that goes missing will be reported to immigration and deported immediately” spits in the face of African Unity. Nabourema says she was alarmed at the language that was used and then decided to write an opinion piece title “South Africa Screw You” to express her dissatisfaction, which has since gained attraction online. The Coordinator of  Pan African movement called Africans Rising says she decided to write about the manner in which she was treated  to raise awareness about immigration in South Africa. ; Farida Bemba Nabourema was invited to attend the African Youth Summit in Pretoria, organised by the Graca Machel Trust. “Delegates who are not from the African continent or who have double citizenship American or French can just walk in easily even though they are not Africans, and this is an organisation promoting Pan Africanism, unity among African youth on the continent. “But when we come as Africans from other countries and we have it at the back of our minds that we are not welcome here and at any moment for any slight mistake, we can be arrested and deported, it automatically tells you that we do not feel welcome.”
