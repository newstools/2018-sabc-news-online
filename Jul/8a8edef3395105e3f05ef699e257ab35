Tributes are pouring in for the Dean of the Faculty of Health Sciences at the University of Cape Town, Professor Bongani Mayosi. Mayosi committed suicide on Friday at the age of 51. He was a cardiology professor who was awarded the county’s highest honour, the Order of Mapungubwe in 2009. Chief Executive of the National Research Foundation, Molapo Qhobela, says his passing is a great loss. “We were privileged to have recognised him as an A-rated National Research Foundation awardee which designated him as a top scientist across the world. We gave him an award last year for the team that he led for the discovery of the sudden death syndrome and he has mentored and has led research in the area of cardiology,” says Qhobela. Students at UCT have also praised his work saying he was someone they looked up to. The Eastern Cape government has announced plans to host a memorial service for Mayosi. Eastern Cape Premier Phumulo Masualle has praised him for his contribution in the medical sphere – describing his death as a major loss. Provincial Government spokesperson Sonwabo Mbananga says details of the service will follow.
