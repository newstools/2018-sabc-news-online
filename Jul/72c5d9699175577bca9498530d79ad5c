African National Congress (ANC) President Cyril Ramaphosa has dismissed suggestions that he’s weak. This comes after members of the ruling party raised concerns that his attempts to unify the party had led to him making too many compromises. This comes as the KwaZulu-Natal ANC Task Team says that its long-awaited provincial elective conference will be held next weekend. Provincial task team co-ordinator Sihle Zikalala says the two factions have agreed to resolve their problems internally. Ramaphosa has been in and out of the province in a bid to find a solution to the impasse. His detractors have questioned whether he is in control or not. “I see my task as uniting the ANC. I’ll give you a good example. Before president Zuma resigned, there were saying you are a weak president, why haven’t you kicked president Zuma out, why haven’t you dealt with him? I said I would rather be seen as a weak president than to split the ANC because that is not my mission. My mission is to keep the ANC united,” says Ramaphosa. Watch the video below for more:
