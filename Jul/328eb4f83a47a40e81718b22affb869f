Transport Deputy Minister Sindisiwe Chikunga has urged scientists and delegates attending the 37th Southern African Transport Conference to assist government with a viable public transport turnaround strategy. She was speaking during the official opening of the four-day conference in Pretoria. Chikunga says the ever increasing fuel prize has the potential to upset the economy. “The road transport sector, especially public transport, must in the short to medium term begin to explore possibilities for the promotion and use of alternative energy for public transport. Research can inform us on the integration of public transport in South Africa, and what can be done to better integrate transport. Is there a way in which we could regulate public transport first? Are public transport operators making any profit? How much of that profit is affected by raise in fuel price? Are the subsidies we are disbursing making any economic sense?”
