Black First Land First has launched a scathing attack on lobby group AfriForum for resuscitating the culpable homicide case against the son of former president Jacob Zuma, Duduzane Zuma. Zuma made a brief appearance at the Randburg Magistrate’s Court Wednesday morning on the case linked to a 2014 collision between his luxury vehicle and a minibus taxi. In 2015‚ the NPA decided not to prosecute Duduzane Zuma after which AfriForum and former prosecutor Gerrie Nel announced that they intended to pursue a private prosecution against Zuma‚ the NPA reversed that decision. “This case was resurfaced by a group of extremists that should be banned in the democratic South Africa. AfriForum wants to see black people fighting. We have never seen a single case where AfriForum hold other white people who kill our people day and night to account. But because Duduzane happen to be the son of the president, he should be demonized, his dignity should be stripped off, it’s really unfair and we are here in solidarity because when they are done with him, we are next,” says BLF deputy president Zanele Lwane.
