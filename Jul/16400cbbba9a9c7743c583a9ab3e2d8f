Police Minister Bheki Cele says a former ANC employee arrested for his alleged involvement in a cash-in-transit heist in Dobsonville, Soweto earlier in July, and is also linked to two heists in North West. Errol Velile Present and three co-accused were arrested on the 6th and 7th of July. They appeared in the Roodepoort Magistrate’s Court. Addressing the media in Cape Town, Cele said Present was previously charged with drunken driving, but failed to appear in court. He has since been dismissed by the ANC. Present is due back in court on the 31st of July. Cele says, “This guy was found with others in Dobsonville for the heist. We arrested two, and later arrested two. He works for the organising department on a temporal basis at Luthuli House, which means when there is organising and mobilising for elections he gets invited.” “This is his third cash heist. Two are at North West. He has jumped the court twice – one was for drunken driving – and he did not appear in court.” Cele also spoke about a number of issues pertaining to crime in the Western Cape. He ruled out the deployment of the SANDF. In 2017, former Police Minister Fikile Mbalula said he was requesting the army to help fight gang violence in the province and Gauteng. Cele says Operation Thunder, which was launched in May, has led to more than 90 000 arrests.  Related video click below:
