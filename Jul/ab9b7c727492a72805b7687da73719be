Dam levels in the City of Cape Town are steadily improving. The collective dam levels in the Metro are now 52.4% full. This is due to good rains that has fallen over the Mother City in recent weeks. The city gets its water from six major dams – the Berg River, the upper and lower Steenbras dams, Theewaterskloof, Voelvlei and Wemmershoek. The dams are set to improve further as another cold front is set to make landfall early next week. “No rain is expected for tomorrow. We should see fairly off-shore conditions into Sunday with temperatures starting to pick up from tomorrow into Sunday and Monday as well. On Tuesday, we do expect our next rain in the form of showers and thunder showers as a cut-off low system will be situated more over the western parts of the province” says forecaster Lebogang Makgadi.
