Democratic Alliance (DA) leader Mmusi Maimane, representatives of the Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (Outa) and several taxi and transport associations will hold a joint press conference in Pretoria. They are meeting to announce planned action in relation to the increasing and un-affordable fuel prices that the government has imposed. Consumers have endured a miserable time at the pumps since higher levies and a weak economy hit prices in April. Since then, through May and June, the petrol price has increased by as much as 15 per cent â€“ up by more than two rand per litre in three months. A further fourth consecutive hike is in the pipeline.
