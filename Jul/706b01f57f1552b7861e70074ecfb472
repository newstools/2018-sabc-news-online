The African National Congress (ANC) National Executive Committee will begin its last Lekgotla for 2018 at the St Georges Hotel in Irene outside Pretoria on Monday morning. The bi-annual meeting ends on Tuesday. Itâ€™s one of the two such meetings called by the ANC every year to assess the implementation of government commitments and to provide guidance on planning. The mid-year ANC Lekgotla is called to identify urgent government priorities requiring attention and to guide the work of those deployed in government. With another fuel price increase in the offing, the two day meeting is expected to discuss among others the sluggish growth and ways to lessen the impact of fuel price increases on the poor. It will be attended by ANC NEC members, ANC Leagues, alliance partners, government ministers and their deputies, Metro Executive Mayors and their municipal managers as well as Director Generals of government departments and CEOs of public entities. President Cyril Ramaphosa will open the gathering by presenting his customary political report. WATCH RELATED VIDEO:
