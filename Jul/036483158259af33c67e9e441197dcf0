Thais reacted with relief, gratitude and exhilaration on Wednesday after the successful rescue of the last group of 12 boys and their soccer coach from a flooded cave complex, ending a 17-day ordeal that gripped Thailand and the world. The last members of the group of 13 from the “Wild Boars”soccer team were brought out of the flooded cave on Tuesday night and taken by helicopter and then by road to a hospital about 70 km from the Thames Lung cave. They joined their team mates in quarantine there and will remain in hospital. The group was rescued after 17 days inside the vast cave complex in northern Thailand where they had ventured after soccer practice on June 23. The rescue dominated front page headlines in Thailand. “All Wild Boars Saved,” read one headline. “Hooyah! Mission accomplished,” read another, echoing the rallying cry of the Thai navy SEALs involved in the rescue. The hashtag #Hooyah was also hugely popular with Thain ctizens wanting to show their support for the hundreds of rescuers, including divers from around the world, who helped toget the boys out. Rescue mission chief Narongsak Osottanakorn thanked people in Thailand and around the world at a news conference on Tuesday for their well wishes and support. “This mission was successful because we had power. The power of love. Everybody sent it to the 13,” Narongsak told reporters. He confirmed that three navy SEALs and a doctor who had been with the boys inside the cave also emerged safely. The boys’ parents would be able to visit them, he said. “They have gone home to shower and then they will be able to visit them, through a glass panel, at the hospital,”Narongsak told reporters.
