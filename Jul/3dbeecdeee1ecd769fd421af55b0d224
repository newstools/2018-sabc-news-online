Analyst, Dr Dale Mckinley says he believes that the Hawks could have a strong case against Duduzane Zuma, who’s expected to appear in the Johannesburg Specialised Commercial Crime Court on Monday to face charges of corruption. The son of former president, Jacob Zuma will be charged in connection with the role he played in trying to bribe former deputy Finance Minister, Mcebisi Jonas, at the Guptas’ Saxonwold family compound in Johannesburg in 2015. Zuma has admitted attending the meeting, but denies that any bribes were offered. Mckinley says “Jonas, in his affidavit, claims that he was offered a R600 million bribe and that if he was to play ball that he would become the finance minister. Why would you be meeting somebody, a deputy minister of finance at a hotel, and take him directly to the Gupta residence that he claims had nothing to do with the Guptas.” “This is not simply about Duduzane Zuma, it is about a whole series of involvement by the Guptas trying to buy political influence and if the prosecution doesn’t have their case it is going to weaken their overall, or many other cases that might be in the pipeline as well. There seems to be an explosive made here and it’s made the Hawks fairly confident that there is a strong case here,” says Mckinley. Watch related videos below
