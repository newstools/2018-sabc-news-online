The leaders of the #FightingAgainstGraduateUnemployment movement have appealed to government to heed their calls for unemployment in South Africa to be taken more seriously. The movement says it has submitted a memorandum of demands to a representative to the Office of the Mayor in Durban, but they believe it is not enough. One of the leaders Nkululeko Ndlovu , a graduate from the Mangosuthu University of Technology says the movement is not only for graduates, but all those who did not have the opportunity to further their studies. “It’s not only for graduates but for people who are unemployed, who want to be heard by the government and the private sector. In fact we are appealing to government and the public sector to say is there any strategic development that is being created to cater for the unemployed. We know this is a national crisis but we are seeking for the government and the private sector to do a difference to each province regarding the matter of unemployed people. On the 3 August I appeal to all people who are unemployed to join us at City Hall. “ Spokesperson in the office of the Mayor Mthunzi Gumede says they are sympathetic to the cause. “We as a city are very sympathetic to the cause of unemployed graduates because we’ve recognised that it’s a problem. Hence we have numerous projects that are focusing on young people. We’ve got a number of strategies; one of it is looking at those who have finished their matric. We’ve got graduate programs, in service programs for graduates and a number of projects that are focusing on graduates so that at least they get an opportunity and experience.”
