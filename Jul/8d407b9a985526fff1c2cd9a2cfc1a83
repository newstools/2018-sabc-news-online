The SABC has been urged to give more attention to the use of vernacular languages on both radio and television programmes. The public broadcaster gave feedback to stakeholders on possible amendments of its editorial policies. Last year the SABC embarked on a campaign to amend its editorial policies. The well attended meeting at the Siyabuswa community hall in the former KwaNdebele also got further inputs from traditional leaders, individuals and organisations. Local leader Ndlelehle Masombuka says: “My greatest wish is to see IsiNdebele been presented in the quality of Isidebele, competing like English with Afrikaans which was underprivileged under the apartheid era.” “We want to see those people who made an impact in the Ndebele people also seen on TV and Radio,” adds Masombuka.
