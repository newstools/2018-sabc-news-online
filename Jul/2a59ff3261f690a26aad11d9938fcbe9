The United Democratic Movement (UDM) is adamant that relations with the Democratic Alliance (DA) in the Nelson Mandela Bay Metro will continue to be compromised, unless the DA apologises to Councillor Mongameli Bobani. Leader Bantu Holomisa says the DA ill-treated Bobani and accused him of being corrupt without evidence. On Wednesday, the UDM boycotted a joint press conference, which focused on the budgets of coalition-led metros in the country. Standing by his decision, UDM leader Bantu Holomisa says the Nelson Mandela Bay Metro budget was not endorsed by his party’s representative, Mongameli Bobani. He says the budget favours urban development more than township development in Port Elizabeth. Now, he wants the DA to apologise for what he calls “arrogance.” “The DA have been claiming that they have enough evidence of corruption against Bobani, but the PWC audit firm report and other investigations have cleared Bobani, then you must apologise, table the report in council and also release the report to the public.” On Wednesday, DA leader Mmusi Maimane, denied any tensions simmering within the Nelson Mandela Bay Metro. “On the issue of the general, we have good relations with them, no issues in that front, more over service delivery continues to take place.” However, some believe the future of coalition politics looks bright only if political differences are put aside. “A coalition government is characterised by tension but in matured democracies of the world that I am familiar with, including Germany and Britain – many people are not even aware that they thrive on coalition, is that there must be give and take and whatever our differences, they mustn’t impact on service delivery, for public service, for we are there in there interest of the public,” says Political Analyst Professor Lesiba Teffo. All the political parties involved in coalition governments say they will however campaign as individual parties for the 2019 polls. Click below for more on the story :
