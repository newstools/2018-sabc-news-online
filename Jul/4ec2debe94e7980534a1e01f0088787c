The Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (Outa) says it welcomes the Gauteng African National Congress‘s conference resolution to scrap e-tolls. Most motorists have been very vocal in their opposition against e-tolls. The ANC in Gauteng has blamed its reduced electoral support on the implementation of the e-toll system. Newly elected ANC Gauteng chairperson David Makhura has said that they will be working with various organs of society to ensure that e-tolls are scrapped. The party has said on many occasions that e-tolls were responsible for the ANC’s reduced electoral support in Gauteng. Outa’s Rudy Heineker says engaging with stakeholders is a step in the right direction. “Although it’s going to be a long process still, we would like to encourage the ANC in Gauteng to speak to stakeholders like Outa, Sanral and to also speak to the people busy with the litigation between Sanral and Outa to get a good indication of what is going on so that they can make a mindful decision.” Meanwhile newly elected Gauteng ANC deputy chairperson Panyaza Lesufi says the decision to scrap e-tolls must advantage everyone. Some motorists who have been paying e-tolls diligently are now demanding refunds. Lesufi says the decision to scrap the system should not disadvantage anybody. “There must be no one that says I’ve come out of this particular decision disadvantaged or worse off. Our approach is very simple, let it be a win-win for everyone, including consumers but most importantly those that have been committed to support this particular initiative.”
