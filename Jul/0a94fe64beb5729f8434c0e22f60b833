Police have used stun grenades and rubber bullets to disperse disgruntled African National Congress (ANC) members from various branches in the Dr Ruth Segomotsi Mompati Region. They attempted to force their way into the regional conference in Christiana. They say legitimate delegates from various branches, have been left out, and those aligned to former premier Supra Mahumapelo are invited as delegates. “I never received a call from the provincial office or an sms. I came to the venue of the conference yesterday. The doors were closed even today, I am here, I am still outside. I am asking myself: how did they replace me,” says one of the delegates. “We are coming from the branches, all of these branches sat in BGM’s and nominated branch delegates to the same regional conference but today we are wondering other delegates are denied access to participate in the conference,” adds another delegate.” ANC NEC member deployed in the North West, who presided over the conference, Sylvia Lucas has dismissed allegations that preparations for the conference were flawed. “We were satisfied that attention was given to the issue they raised from the dispute that was there. And the ANC disputes resolution committee at the national level did not have any other disputes again. There is a bigger political issue here, that I can see because there are also leaders that are not necessary in the province and the region that got interest.” Watch video below:
