Zimbabwean election authorities have dismissed reports alleging irregularities in postal voting currently under way ahead of the July 30 polls. Zimbabwe Electoral Commission said that postal voting was done in accordance with the law and that according to the Electoral Act, postal ballots are a secret and no one will be present or can observe the voting. The opposition MDC Alliance said it was concerned that postal voting by police officers in a police camp in Bulawayo was done secretly. They allege it’s a ploy to rig the upcoming vote in favour of the ruling Zanu-PF. But Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC) say there was no role for candidates, political party representatives or observers. ZEC Chairperson Priscilla Chigumba’s sentiments were echoed by police commander for the 2018 elections Who said that no police officer was being forced to vote for certain candidates? Police Commander Erasmus Makodza said the police were fully geared to ensure the polls are held in a peaceful environment. Zimbabwe’s main opposition party marched to the independent election agency for the second time in as many months demanding reforms it said were vital for a credible vote in July. President Emmerson Mnangagwa will square off with 22 other presidential candidates in the polls. He has promised to deliver a free and fair vote.  Related video click below:
