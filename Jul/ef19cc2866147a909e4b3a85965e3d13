The High Court in Polokwane will on Tuesday hand down judgment in the case of a 29-year-old man who is facing multiple charges of rape, house breaking and robbery. David MamvuraÂ is on trial for crimes that were committed in and around Polokwane between 2012 and 2014. Justice Francis Kganyago is expected to give his ruling on whether the State has provided sufficient evidence that Mamvura committed crimes against more than 30 women. The State has submitted that Mamvura was linked to the rape victims by DNA evidence. Mamvura, who is representing himself, however argued that he did not give his consent for a DNA swab. He also stated that the DNA samples had been tempered with. Mamvura also told the court that State witnesses had been bought to testify against him.
