The Congress of Traditional Leaders of South Africa (Contralesa) says it will engage with all political parties and arrange a land summit on expropriating land without compensation. As public hearings continue around the country on the issue, the EFF has come out in support of comments made by the King of AmaZulu, Goodwill Zwelithini, who called on his people to stand up and defend their land. Both the EFF and Contralesa pledged their support for amendments to Section 25 of the Constitution, to allow for expropriation of land without compensation. Political analysts say the EFF’s turnaround is due to the traditional leader’s importance in the 2019 election. Contralesa General Secretary Zolani Mkiva says there is nothing untoward about its engagement and concurrence with the EFF on the issue. “It’s time for all political parties to express themselves in terms of their policy direction, and policy perspective, and it must manifest in their manifestos for the 2019 election. We are challenging all the political parties – and that’s why we are going to be meeting all of them – that are why there is nothing untoward with us engaging with the EFF… and actually they have taken the challenge and they have assured us that in the next six months they will work on that policy,” says Mkiva “On the issue of the summit it was our resolution as Contralesa that we need to call a land summit and invite all the progressive formations in South Africa, so that we can speak with one voice on this issue and not confuse it and conflate it,” says Mkiva  Watch full interview below:
