Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs (Cogta) has received updated reports on forensic audits into 15 Limpopo municipalities which invested more than R1 billion in VBS Mutual Bank. The department has met local and district municipal representatives in Polokwane as part of an oversight visit. Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs Minister Zweli Mkhize is calling for tougher action. Only nine municipalities produced acceptable audit outcomes. “We have also received reports of the various progresses being made by municipalities and the provincial government on the issue of the funds being invested at VBS. The MEC’s for finance and Cogta have already embarked on the forensic investigations on all those municipalities,” says Mkhize. The oversight visit will also focus on issues concerning governance. The generation of municipal revenue is also a concern. “We are looking at the issues of governance which have been a challenge. We are looking at the issues of  financial management, which have also been a challenge. There have been a number of municipalities which have received disclaimer audit outcomes and some with adverse audit outcomes and then the whole program of financial recovery where the issues of revenue generation are being worked on,” adds Mkhize. The Minister is expected to start his oversight visits in the Vhembe District on Wednesday. WATCH RELATED VIDEO BELOW:
