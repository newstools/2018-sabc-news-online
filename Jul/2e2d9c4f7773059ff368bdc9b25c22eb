Zimbabwe’s President Emmerson Mnangagwa has re-iterated that Land Reform in the country is irreversible. Mnangagwa made this comment when he was addressing a gathering of white residents in Harare on Saturday. In the 2000’s, former President Robert Mugabe passed laws that resulted in land grabs and forced removals, mainly of white farmers. Since Mnangagwa took office he has been trying to unite the country and the meeting with the white community is part of the campaign to attract investors back to Zimbabwe, since the country is facing Economic challenges. Mnangagwa has maintained that the Land policy will not change but encouraged them to work with Government. He believes the problems of Zimbabwe can be resolved through unity.
