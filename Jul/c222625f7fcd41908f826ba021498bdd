The Science and Technology Department will launch the National Science Week at the University of Mpumalanga in Nelspruit on Saturday. There will be exhibitions in different locations across the country to mark this campaign. The theme for 2018 is: “Deepening our democracy through science”. Science and Technology Minister, Mmamoloko Kubayi-Ngubane says the aim of the campaign is to expose learners still in high school to different career options in this sector.
