Lawyers for suspended South African Revenue Services Commissioner Tom Moyane say their client has been treated unfairly since his suspension three months ago. Moyane is responding to President Cyril Ramaphosa’s letter after requesting that the investigation into the revenue service, chaired by retired Judge Robert Nugent, be stopped or disbanded. Nugent rejected the request and labelled Moyane’s submission as a “disgrace”. Witnesses have made damning allegations about Moyane’s reign as SARS commissioner during the inquiry. Moyane is also facing a disciplinary hearing after being suspended. Speaking at a media briefing in Johannesburg, Moyane’s attorney Eric Mabuza says Moyane only wants the inquiry to be fair. “The demand was for the president to stop one or both of the two parallel inquires, failing which could have commenced this week in either the High Court or the Constitutional Court. The cautious and commendable approach is that the president will await the ruling on the objections raised and which are scheduled for oral argument on 21 July 2018. Moyane appeals for restraint in the ongoing process of gratuitous insults, defamation of character and all other unfair treatment by the media and others who profess to be independent and objective.” Watch the full media briefing below:
