Unions involved in the Eskom wage negotiations have requested a meeting with Finance Minister Nhlanhla Nene, Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan and the board of the power utility. Wage talks between unions the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM), National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (Numsa), Solidarity and the employer resumed on Tuesday. Eskom revised its offer from a 7% wage increase. The details of its new offer have not been revealed. Workers are demanding an 8% salary hike this year and 8.5% for the next two years. NUM Spokesperson Livhuwani Mammburu says they feel they need higher level intervention to finalise a deal. NUM has also cited concerns that a representative of government, Gavin Hartford, is undermining the talks. The union says it wants Hatford to serve as just an observer because he’s not impartial.
