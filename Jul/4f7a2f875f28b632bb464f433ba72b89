Police Minister Bheki Cele has joined hundreds of police cadets at the 100 Men March in Pretoria. The marchers are walking to the Union Buildings to raise awareness against gender based violence. Cele has admitted that the police sometimes do not act appropriately when domestic violence and gender abuse cases are reported. He said that not all police officers are rotten apples and that the cadets were brought to take part in the march to learn and appreciate the importance of working with communities. Representatives from churches and NGOs are also attending the march. Spokesperson for the Commission for Gender Equality Javu Baloyi says it is time everyone in South Africa take a stand against women and child abuse.
