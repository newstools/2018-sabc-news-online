Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa says he is confident that the national elections scheduled for the July 30 will be peaceful. Mnangagwa addressed the media after meeting with The Elders led by former United Nations Secretary General, Kofi Annan in Harare on Friday morning. The Elders are in the country to get first hand information about Zimbabwe’s readiness for the elections. Mnangagwa has emphasised that the incident in Bulawayo where a bomb exploded at a rally in June, was meant to kill him. “We are happy that up till now our people, political parties included, have heeded our call for non-violence. Yes, there was an incident in Bulawayo, but that was intended to assassinate me, not democracy. So, we are moving forward and that we have the ZEC which is an independent commission of this country government has no role in controlling or influencing ZEC at all they are guided by the electoral act of the country and the constitution and those who feel that ZEC has not complied with the law or the constitution our courts are open,” says Mnangagwa.
