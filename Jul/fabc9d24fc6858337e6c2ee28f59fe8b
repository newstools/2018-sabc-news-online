Human Settlements Minister Nomaindia Mfeketo, wants action taken against the officials at a subsidiary of her department – the Community Schemes Ombud Service (CSOS) for investing millions of rands in the controversial VBS mutual bank. The scheme has invested R80 million in VBS without the approval of the minister and the board. Mfeketo says the officials and the board have been given SCOS 14 days in which to explain. “We’ve called the board and asked them what is it that they have done because they’re responsible … they’re supposed to be acting.” “I’ve given them 14 days to tell me what they are going to do with those people who deposited that money without any approval from either myself, the Treasury including the board itself they didn’t consult,” adds Mfeketo.
