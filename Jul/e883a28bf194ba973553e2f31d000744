Groote Schuur hospital in Cape Town has almost doubled the number of elective operations performed as part of Mandela Month. The #Operation 100 Project ensured that almost 200 vulnerable patients received life-changing surgery and operations in honour of Madiba’s 100th birthday. Staff donated their time to perform the surgeries which included hip or knee replacements, removal of cataracts or ear, nose and throat procedures. Provincial Health Minister, NomaFrench Mbombo says the patients were on the waiting list for at least a year. She says: ‘We are reducing the waiting period through sponsors, public and private. This year we wanted to do 100 subjects to getting sponsors and we ended up getting 195. So if you’ve been number 475 and probably your next operation would have been in 2021, now we reduced it to where you can have it either this year or next year.”
