Residents of Makhanda formerly known as Grahamstown in the Eastern Cape fear the worst as the city faces water shortage with its main supply dam to the west of the city down to less than 30%. The town has two months supply of water left, with the quality of water also raising concerns as e-coli was discovered in the water supply two months ago. Residents have called on national government to intervene as day zero is fast approaching. Water and Sanitation spokesperson, Sputnik Ratau says ageing infrastructure and lack of funds remains a challenge. He says: “A lot of municipalities suffer from almost the same issues of lack of maintenance, lack of capacity, lack of funding so that they can be able to do some of the work that they do. The issue of ageing infrastructure, you might find that some of the systems are operating at levels of over capacity from what they were planned for.” Related Video
