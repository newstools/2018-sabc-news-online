The scheduled motion of no confidence motion against Cape Town mayor Patricia de Lille has been withdrawn. It was due to be brought by the DA caucus during Thursday’s council meeting. She recently won a High Court application challenging her expulsion from the Democratic Alliance (DA), which controls the council and also narrowly survived an earlier no confidence motion. De Lille’s been embroiled in allegations of maladministration in the council, which she is denied.
