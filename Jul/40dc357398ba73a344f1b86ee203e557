Gold mining companies have confirmed tabling wage offers that are way below the demands of unions. The three gold miners are offering wage increases of between R450 and R500 for entry-level underground workers. The four unions NUM, AMCU, Solidarity and UASA are demanding wages of between R10500 and R12500 a month. Currently most entry level workers earn around R8000 a month. Charmane Russell from the Minerals Council says unions’ demands cannot be met in the current economic environment. “The gold industry continues to face major challenges. First is stagnant gold prices, second is rising costs. You will be aware that wages and electricity together comprise around 70% of the total costs base in the sector. The third one includes ageing infrastructure. The last one relates to policy uncertainty which has had a huge impact on investor confidence.”
