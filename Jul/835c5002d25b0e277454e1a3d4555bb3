The owners of the trucks that were torched at a construction site at Pinetown, west of Durban, say their loss is estimated to about R12 million. Wilson Anthony and Vukile Mnembe say four trucks and three tractors were destroyed. They have called on the government to intervene and end what they call an ongoing feud in the construction industry. They believe this is not a once off incident as there have been other incidents of machines being stolen. Local ward councillor, Melanie Brauteseth, says such incidents have been happening all around Ethekwini. Meanwhile, police are investigating a case of arson and damage to property following the incident. Divisional Commander of the Ethekwini Fire Department, Sbu Dlamini says preliminary reports indicate that unknown men attacked the security guard and set the vehicles alight. Dlamini says they managed to extinguish the fire but the vehicles were already damaged. Watch related video below:
