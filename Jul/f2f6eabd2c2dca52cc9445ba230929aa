Nehawu at the University Fort Hare in the Eastern Cape has revised its wage demand from 15% to 10%. It says it’s also willing to meet with the management of the institution to end the month-long wage strike. The strike also saw the postponement of mid-year examinations on the Alice, Bhisho and East London campuses. Nehawu secretary at Fort Hare Mzi Lingela says: “The strike is still on, we were supposed to meet with management for bargaining on Wednesday but management requested to postpone the planned bargaining. They are going to give us another date so we are still waiting for them.” “Currently we are sitting between 10% and 8% just to show our willingness as Nehawu to negotiate. We can even settle to 8%, we are waiting on the management to sit on the table and discuss this, we will take it from there,” adds Lingela. Related video
