Families of the Life Esidimeni victims say they are yet to find justice for the death of their loved ones. They accuse officials of dragging their feet in criminal investigations. Elizabeth Phangela is one of the families still looking for answers. Her relative, Christopher Makhoba, was among the 144 patients was transferred to unlicensed NGO’s, but never lived to tell the tale. Despite receiving  compensation  Phangela says she is yet to find closure. “As long as those people responsible have not been prosecuted I won’t find closure,” says Phangela. The implicated officials, include former Health Mec Qedani Mahlangu, HoD Dr Barney Selebano and Mental Health Director, Dr Makgabo Manamela, are believed to be the brains behind the deadly transfers. Despite the Arbitration process finding damning evidence against them, they have not taken personal responsibility. Families of the deceased believe the NPA is dragging its feet in criminal investigations. “We need the official charges. We need them to go to court; we need them to tell us exactly what happened,” says Christine Nxumalo of the Esidimeni Family Committee. The NPA says investigations are yet to be concluded. The African National Congress says Mahlangu’s matter is still before the party’s Integrity Committee but the Democratic Alliance (DA) believes this is just another delaying tactic. “I tell you why the ANC Integrity Committee is not doing their job, it’s because they are comrades; they are covering up; they are protecting their friends. Why is Qedani, after the terrible events of life Esidimeni, still on their executive committee,” says Jack Bloom from DA Gauteng. The DA has instructed government to take legal action against the implicated officials. But for now, families will have to wait a little bit longer for the wheels of justice to turn.
