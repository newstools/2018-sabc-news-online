The State says it’s ready for the case against former President Jacob Zuma at Pietermaritzburg High Court on Friday. Legal experts say Zuma’s new legal counsel is most likely to request a postponement to familiarise themselves with the case. He faces 16 charges including money-laundering, corruption and racketeering, emanating from South Africa’s 1999 Arms deal. The state indicated it was ready from the onset, even setting a provisional trial date for November. But the same cannot be said about the Zuma’s defence and once again on Friday, the ball will be in the former President’s court. While his defence indicated they may seek to pursue a review application, there is still uncertainty about the former President’s legal fees. Zuma terminated the services of his long time senior counsel Kemp J Kemp due to finances. This after the Democratic Alliance (DA) and Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) took the matter of government’s agreement to fund Zuma legal fees to court. At Friday’s appearance, the new defence team will probably map out the way forward. Meanwhile, the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) also rejected representations by French arms company Thales to withdraw charges against it. Thales, which has been represented in court by Christine Gurrier, faces charges of fraud and corruption. Gurrier, who travels from France to attend proceedings, was excused from Friday’s appearance. Outside the court, hundreds of Zuma supporters are expected to once again gather to support the former President. A night vigil will also be held in Pietermaritzburg on Thursday night.
