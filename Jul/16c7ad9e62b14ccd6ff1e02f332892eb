President Cyril Ramaphosa says the Africa free trade area agreement is the main enabler in which the continent’s dwindling manufacturing sector can grow. He says Africa is lagging behind in manufacturing globally. The agreement, which is yet to be finalised and signed by a number of countries, will enable African countries to trade with each other without tariffs or lower tariffs. Ramaphosa says the agreement will help make products that can be made on the continent cheaper and more accessible to the people. The President was answering questions at the South African-Ghana Business Forum in Centurion on Thursday. “Manufacturing on the continent is at its lowest level… and even in South Africa, manufacturing has been tapering down on a number of products. But the Free Trade agreement is what I see as an ignitor of industrial activity on the continent, and also an enabler of manufacturing – because it will establish a common market which will be a free trade area,” says Ramaphosa.
