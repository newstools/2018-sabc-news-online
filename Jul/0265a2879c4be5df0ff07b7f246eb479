President Cyril Ramaphosa has arrived in Abu Dhabi on his last leg of a three nation tour he has been embarking on, including the Middle East and Nigeria. He’s in the region to strengthen ties as South Africa seeks new investment opportunities. Earlier this year, he announced that he wanted to raise $100 billion over the next five years to create jobs. President Ramaphosa is scheduled to meet the Crown prince of Abu Dhabi, Sheik Mohamed bin Zayed. He will also address a business forum to explore more investment opportunities.   Ramaphosa has vowed to continue to ramp up efforts to attract investors to the country. Talks are expected to centre around growing bilateral trade between Abu Dhabi and South Africa. The UAE is a growing export market for South Africa’s products, which saw an escalation on trade figures – currently standing at R38 billion in 2017 from R 6 billion in 2011.
