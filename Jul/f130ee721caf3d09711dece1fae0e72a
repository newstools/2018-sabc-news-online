The pastor, linked to the murder of Hlompo Mohapi from Thembalethu in George, is still behind bars. But on Friday, his wife was also arrested and she’ll appear in court on Monday. Mohapi’s family says they’re shocked at how the matter has unfolded. The 25-year-old was buried in George on Saturday. Murdered in the prime of her life, the body of the mother of two was found next to a gravel road near Herold’s Bay early this month. She’d been stabbed and her throat slit. The 30-year-old pastor was arrested after his car was linked to the crime and it’s alleged he took out a life insurance policy on Mohapi. Speaking to a packed community hall during Mohapi’s funeral, a friend Babalwe Mone says she was a humble person. “Hlompho was a very loving person.  I watched her growing up, going to school as a child, I watched her grow as a woman, working.  She was a very humble person even if she didn’t know you she just blended in, it was like she knew you for ages.” The pastor also faces a fraud charge. Another suspect arrested earlier after he was found with Mohapi’s cell phone could also be charged with murder. Both men will appear in the George Magistrate’s court on Wednesday for bail.
