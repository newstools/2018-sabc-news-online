Capetonians and visitors to the Mother City have been advised to avoid Clifton’s First Beach because of a sewage spill in the Atlantic ocean. The city’s Health Department has erected signage to warn the public not to use the beach following the sewer blockage at a nearby property. Mayoral committee member for Safety and Security, JP Smith says workers are trying to gain access to the premises to attend to the problem. He says the contaminated sea water poses risks to public health. He says: “Members of the public are cautioned to avoid contact with the water until further notice. Any form of full recreational activity such as swimming, diving, water skiing, surfing, paddle skiing and wind surfing may increase the risk of gastrointestinal problems as well as skin, eye, ear and respiratory irritations.” “Any person who uses the sea in this area therefore does so at their own risk,” adds Smith.
