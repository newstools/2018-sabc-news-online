The South African Heath Products Regulatory Authority has issued a recall on blood pressure and heart condition drug, Dynaval Co, due to cancer fears. This follows findings that one of Dynaval Co’s ingredients has been contaminated with chemicals that can possibly cause the disease. The contamination was found in Valsartan, which is imported from China. Similar recalls were recently made in Europe and the United States. SAHPRA representative Florah Matlala says it is not yet clear if the public health sector has been affected by contamination. “High blood pressure and heart medication affect quite a number of people in the population so I am unable to give you the exact number but I will just say it’s actually a large number and in terms of companies that are recalling we have identified one company The investigations are still underway to indentify whether the product of on state tender on not so if the product is not tender for the government then definitely they will be affected.” The CEO of Pharma Dynamics which manufactures Dynaval Co in Cape Town, Erik Roos says they have already started recalling the drug from pharmacies and doctors’ rooms. “The process that started 7 days ago, the recall should be completed probably next few days as patients go  back to their pharmacies or doctors to seek alternative treatment, we have a system to reimburse through the wholesalers, and the doctors and the pharmacies back to the patient but the steps is go back to your pharmacist or dispensing doctor and from there they will receive new medication and reimbursement.”
