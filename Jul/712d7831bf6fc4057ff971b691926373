An urgent court application challenging the removal of the mayor in Kagisano-Molopo Local Muncipality in Ganyesa, was postponed in the North West High Court on Thursday. An ANC deployee Bitsang Lenkopane made the application. She was unceremoniously removed by councillors from her own party earlier this month. Lenkopane has taken the entire 29 member municipal council to court. She says she was unconstitutionally removed from her mayoral position. The ANC enjoys a majority in the council, with 20 seats against 9 of the opposition. However, Lenkopane and her supporters, argue that her detractors did not follow procedure, by allegedly disbanding a mayoral committee and electing a new mayor. They should have voted on a motion of no confidence against her. Her lawyer, Advocate Johan Scheepers, also filed an urgent application challenging the appointment of a new municipal manager. The legal representative for the municipality and the municipal manager says although the matter is not urgent, they are ready to proceed. “We were more ready with the case, and we believe that there is no urgency on this matter. Its unfortunate that the papers were served late, and when you represent the municipality there should be a council resolution. So, it’s only for them to file papers however, be it as it may, we are ready to proceed,” said lawyers for the municipality, Tsholofelo Shuping. The case was quickly postponed. “I take it that you did not prepare a draft order, these matters are postponed to the 24 day of august, 2018, the issue of cost is reserved, said acting high court judge Itiriseng Matlapeng. Neither Lenkopane and her supporters, nor municipality officials attended the court proceedings.
