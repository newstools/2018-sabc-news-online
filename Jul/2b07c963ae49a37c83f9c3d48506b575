President Cyril Ramaphosa says his meeting with Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari will take the two countries’ relations to a higher level. Relations have been frosty, with some Nigerians claiming they are being targeted and in some cases killed in South Africa. President Ramaphosa has dismissed attacks on Nigerians as criminal activities. He was speaking after talks with President Buhari in the Nigerian capital, Abuja. He says: “We are now opening a new page in the relationship between South Africa and Nigeria and this new page gives us the opportunity to go beyond where we have been before. We will be able to find a number of areas where we can reach agreement particularly in view of the opening up of the African continent through the Free Trade Agreement when we will be able to ensure that our economies grow by leaps and bounds.” Meanwhile after the talks, President Buhari said he would soon sign the Continental Free Trade Area Agreement. Currently 49 African countries have signed, though many of their parliaments, including South Africa’s, still have to ratify it. Nigeria says it’s still consulting its people in over 30 states. The agreement will see free movement of people and goods and facilitate intra-Africa Trade. Watch related video below
