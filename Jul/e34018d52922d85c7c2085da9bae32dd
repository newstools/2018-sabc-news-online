South African HIV/AIDS activists have started arriving in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, ahead of the 22nd International AIDS Conference. This group of activists is singing around the streets of Amsterdam attracting much attention from locals. The International AIDS Conference is the largest gathering of activists, researchers, policymakers and government. It is due to start on Monday. The South African government delegation will be led by Deputy President David Mabuza as Chairperson of the South African National AIDS Council. South African activists have made sure their presence is felt in the host city of Amsterdam. In true South African style, they are wearing head wrap or doeks, ululating and singing “ziyajika izinto” much to the amazement of locals and tourists, who are taking photos and videos of the experience. South Africa hosted the previous International AIDS conference in Durban two years ago. About 20 thousand people are expected to attend the five day conference 2018.
