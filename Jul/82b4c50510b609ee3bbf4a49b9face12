The alleged terror twins Brandon-Lee and Tony-Lee Thulsie are back in the Johannesburg High Court Tuesday morning. The brothers have been charged with conspiracy and incitement to commit terrorism. In an indictment submitted to the court in April 2017, the State listed 12 activities the twins were allegedly instructed to carry out. They were to use firearms, explosives and possibly poison. The duo has remained in custody since their arrest in July 2016 and has had their case postponed as the State attempted to retrieve more information from outside of South Africa. Related video
