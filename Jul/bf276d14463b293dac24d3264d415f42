A teenager from Mpumalanga is representing South Africa at the World Science Forum to be held in London. 16 year old Precious Kaunda is among four learners jetting off over the weekend. The school is overcrowded and under-resourced but Precious Kaunda has not made this stop her. She outshined over 33-thousands learners from across the country at the Science Olympiad held in Pretoria earlier this year.And all her hard work has paid off. “I am honoured. It feels great though I am also nervous but I’m really happy that I got the chance to go represent this country,” said Kaunda. She’s a role model for school mates and a beacon of pride for her family. “Precious did it in a school which maybe most of the people didn’t think one day we will raise a flag for that school that why I am so glad, I’m so happy,” said her mother, Gloria Mthembu-Kaunda. “I am one of the teachers who are motivated seeing young people flourishing in life, I draw passion from that, now this trip going to London is going to assist her a lot to open her horizon in terms of science,” said her teacher, Ofentse Maodi. Precious plans to study medicine next year. “There is no better time to be involved in science than now. i see myself as a gynaecologist, I want to better my community.” With determination and hard work, Precious is an example that your attitude determines your altitude.
