Unions at Eskom are still consulting their members on the employer’s revised wage offer this week. This comes after all three unions including the NUM, NUMSA and Solidarity rejected Eskom’s last offer of  7%. The parties have agreed to keep mum on Eskom’s latest offer until the unions have met with Ministers of Finance, Nhlanhla Nene, and Public Enterprises, Pravin Gordhan. According to media reports, Eskom has tabled a new offer of 7.5% for this year – and 6.5% for 2019 followed by 6.25% in the subsequent year. Eskom’s spokesperson Khulu Phasiwe says: “Eskom has revised its offer of 7% slightly upward but we are not in a position to say what the offer is.” “There was an agreement with unions that they will like to give that feedback to their constituencies. After that they will request a meeting with Ministers of Finance and Public Enterprises – and only after that meeting can we make a pronouncement on the figure on the table,” adds Phasiwe.
