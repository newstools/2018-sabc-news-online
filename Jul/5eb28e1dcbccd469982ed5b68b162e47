African National Congress (ANC) Deputy President David Mabuza is in Mahikeng, in the North West province on Friday, where he is leading the party’s Thuma-Mina campaign in preparation of next year’s elections. This follows violent protests that rocked the province two months ago, when residents demanded the removal of former premier Supra Mahumapelo. Mabuza is expected to address residents on interventions in the province to unify the deeply divided ruling party. He has paid a courtesy visit to the local chief Kgosi Montshioa accompanied by Mahumapelo. The Deputy President is also expected to hand out title deeds to several community members.
