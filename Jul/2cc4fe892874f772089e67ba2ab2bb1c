The son of former President Jacob Zuma has been laid to rest in the West Park Cemetery in Johannesburg. The 25-year-old Vusi Zuma died earlier this week of lupus-related complications. He was the youngest of the five children Zuma had with Kate Mantsho who died in 2000. Earlier today, ANC president Cyril Ramaphosa asked ANC members to observe a moment of silence for former President Jacob Zuma’s family as they lay to rest his son Vusi Nhlakanipho Zuma in Johannesburg. A prayer meeting of the National Interfaith Council of South Africa (NICSA) in Chatsworth, Durban,  where the former President was the main speaker, was cancelled because of the funeral. Minority Front leader Shameen Thakur-Rajbansi was also one of the dignitaries invited to the anti-crime prayer. NICSA’s Bishop Bernard Coopasamy says the choice of these leaders to speak at the prayer meeting was informed by the roles they have played in advancing social cohesion in the province. “Unfortunately because of the passing away of former President Jacob Zuma’s son, we had to cancel our meeting for Chatsworth until the 21st of July 2018. And then the following program that we are having in Phoenix that is definitely on the 14th of July 2018.”
