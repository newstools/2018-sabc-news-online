Parliament’s Transport Committee has condemned the shooting and killing of 11 taxi operators who were ambushed by unknown gunmen in KwaZulu-Natal over the weekend. The committee says it hopes that the incident will not discourage the taxi industry from serving the 65% of the nation’s commuters who use this mode of public transport. The 11 operators were among 17 people who were travelling back to Johannesburg after attending the funeral of a colleague at Matimatolo in KwaZulu-Natal. The shooting took place on the R74 between Colenso and Weenen in KwaZulu-Natal on Saturday evening. “We are really appalled by what has happened in KZN and we believe that the police will do everything   at their best to be able to arrest these people who were involved in this. But our condolences to the taxi industry, our condolences to the bereaved families. And we believe this will not deter this industry from continuing to operate because 65% of the commuters on a daily basis in the Republic of South Africa are commuting using taxis,” says Transport Committee Chairperson, Dikeledi Magadzi.  Police spokesperson, Vish Naidoo, says security forces are continuing their investigations into the fatal shooting.  Naidoo says the motive for the shooting is still not known. “We are very heavily reliant on where our investigations will take us, both in terms of establishing the motive as well as establishing who is responsible for the attack on Saturday night. Basically the plan is to mobilise resources from crime intelligence, the Hawks, general detectives, our special task force and other specialised units. These officers gather evidence, information and try to establish who is responsible for incidents like this one.”
