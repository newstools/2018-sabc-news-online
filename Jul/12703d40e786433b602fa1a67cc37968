Suspended SARS Commissioner Tom Moyane will host a media conference on Monday to brief the public about the latest developments in matters related to his term of office. Moyane is also expected to divulge details of President Cyril Ramaphosa’s response to his demand that the president stop or disband the investigation into the Revenue Service chaired by retired judge Robert Nugent. Judge Nugent has refused Moyane’s request to suspend the investigation pending the end of the disciplinary hearing against the suspended commissioner led by Advocate Azhar Bham. The president suspended Moyane in March during a meeting where Ramaphosa informed Moyane that he had lost confidence in his ability to lead SARS and offered him an opportunity to resign with immediate effect. Moyane’s lawyer Eric Mabuza confirmed the media conference. “I can confirm that Commissioner Tom Moyane will host a press conference to bereif the public about the latest development in the current matter dealing with his current term of office in SARS and his reaction to the President responding to his demands and deadline.” Watch for more:
