Former President Jacob Zuma has reiterated his claim that the fraud and corruption case he is facing at the Pietermaritzburg High Court is unfair. The case has been postponed to November to allow Zuma’s team time to prepare. Addressing supporters outside court, Zuma says he’s confident that the case does not hold water because he never attended any of the arms procurement meetings mentioned in the case. Zuma says the case which has lasted 17 years confirms the adage justice delayed is justice denied. His defence team will apply for permanent stay of prosecution in November on corruption charges stemming from the multi-billion-rand arms deal. A stay in prosecution is a ruling by the court halting further legal process in a trial. Zuma’s new legal representative, advocate Mike Hellens has told the High Court in Pietermaritzburg that the application will rest among other things on the alleged irregular conduct of the investigators and the National Prosecuting Authority. Hellens says he will also argue that there has been interference from the executive in the independence of the prosecuting authority. He mentioned the tapping of phones and spy tapes as two such examples. “I mention only two aspects, two very serious constitutional implications. The Browse Mole report where the DSO with no lawful authority were eavesdropping, telephone tapping and spying on Mr Zuma and compiled a report as if this was some Cold War operation of the 1950’s or 60’s,” says Hellens.
