The anti-abuse group, Women and Men Against Child Abuse (WMACA), has welcomed the 12 year sentence of a man from Wilderness in the Southern Cape for child pornography. Forty-year old Tyrone James also received a four year suspended sentence for the illegal possession of drugs. James was arrested at a roadblock in March 2016, during a search of his house, more than 56 000 images of child pornography were found on his computer. Children Rights Activist Joanne Barrett says the sentence should serve as a lesson to others. Barret says, â€œThe images that were described in court were absolutely gruesome and violent and very evil and like I said not being a victimless crime he has in fact created more of a market by viewing these images so he is not innocent in any of this by just viewing one or 57 000 images.
