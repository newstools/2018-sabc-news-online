The disciplinary inquiry hearing against suspended SARS Commissioner, Tom Moyane will commence on Saturday in Johannesburg. Advocate Azhar Bham, SC, is the presiding officer into the disciplinary charges against Moyane. Charges against Moyane relate to alleged misconduct in violation of his duties and responsibilities in terms of the South African Revenue Service Act, Public Finance Management Act and SARS Code of Conduct. Moyane’s lawyer Eric Mabuza says he and his client are looking forward to the hearing. “We are pleased that we’ll have an opportunity to clarify all these misconceptions.  You’ll remember that our client has always said that he needs an opportunity to clear his name.  He’s complained about the unfairness of the inquiry, you would have also seen from the president’s submission, he said that Mr Moyane is sabotaging the inquiry which is not true, so tomorrow we’ll have an opportunity to set the record straight and explain the reasons why Mr Moyane complains why the inquiry against him is unfair,” says Mabuza.
