State Capture Commission Chair Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo will petition President Cyril Ramaphosa to speed up security clearances for his investigators. The clearances have been delayed and Zondo says this is threatening to derail investigations. He announced that the Commission will begin public hearings on August 20 with as many as eight witnesses. Zondo doesn’t suspect sabotage in the delays, but he believes it is inefficiency and incompetence. The State Capture Commission addressed the media in a Johannesburg at midday. The briefing follows a ruling of the High Court in Johannesburg to have the commission’s deadline extended by two years calculated from March the 1st. The remedial action of the State of Capture report of former Public Protector advocate Thuli Madonsela also recommended a period of 180 days. Last week Justice Zondo filed an urgent application for an order to extend, and on Monday he welcomed the North Gauteng High Court’s decision to extend by a further 24 month. The President and Public Protector among others have to show cause why the period should not be extended.  The Commission was established by former President Jacob Zuma before he left office five months ago. It was initially set to run for six months but was granted a two-year extension.
