He says neither government nor the ANC wants to expropriate land under the Ingonyama Trust. He says: “I had a wonderful meeting with his majesty the king Zwelithi and we discussed a wide range of issues. He and I had a wonderful warm communication.” “The issue of Ingonyama Trust came up and I felt the need to go and meet him. We discussed the issue and I assured him that the government has no intention whatsoever to take the land from the Ingonyama Trust. I reaffirm the land is under the Ingonyama Trust as per legislation and that he has custody of the land on behalf of the people in Kwa-Zulu Natal,” says Ramaphosa.
