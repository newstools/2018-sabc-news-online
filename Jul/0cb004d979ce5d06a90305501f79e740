Power utility Eskom has offered a 7% wage increase for members affiliated to the National Union of Metal Workers (NUMSA), Solidarity and NUM. Unions say Eskom gave them two wage agreement options which they will take to their members for final decision. The first option consists of a 7% wage increase for the next three years with a housing allowance, while the second option consists of a 7.5% wage increase with no housing allowance. The unions says they will be meeting with Eskom next week to finalise the wage settlement. NUMSA general Secretary Irvin Jim says: “There is an offer on the table and constitutes progress from where we have been. Ideally we would have loved to take it to our members but we can say that the 7% for a three year period and the 7.5 and 7.7% for the next two years we regard this as progress and we are taking this back to our members for consultation.” Related video
