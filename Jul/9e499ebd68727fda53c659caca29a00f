The North West government says it will be forced to seek money in order to repair damages incurred at the Mmabana Arts, Culture and Sport Foundation head offices in Mahikeng. The centre was torched during violent protests earlier this year. North West Premier Job Mokgoro visited the centre Thursday morning to assess the damage. Mmabana Arts, Culture and Sport Foundation focuses on developing young talent in the entertainment industry. It’s known for producing talented entertainers that have dominated the South African entertainment landscape. Three months ago, it became the target of angry community members who set the building alight. Final damage estimation is not available yet, but is will run into millions of rand. The Foundation’s CEO Otsile Ntsoane says: “The whole electrical things have been destroyed. Public works is unable to determine in figures in terms of rand and cents because it requires other expertise.” Government admits that there is no money available to fix the building and says they will have to approach the department of public works for funding. The building was not insured. The North West premier Job Mokgoro says: “We are approaching some institutions to see if we could get into some funding arrangements. But I think the essence of the action that we are preparing for now is to just tune the information we have and have the matter tabled at the executive council which will be happening soon.” Management of the foundation dismissed concerns that the centre was dysfunctional even prior to the protests in April. They have however admitted that serious intervention is needed to resuscitate the institution. WATCH RELATED VIDEO BELOW:
