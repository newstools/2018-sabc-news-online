The Gugulethu Fire Station on the Cape Flats has been set alight during overnight protests by residents. Cape Town Fire and Rescue spokesperson, Theo Layne says firefighters were forced to vacate the premises and law enforcement agencies were called in to disperse protesters. He says the front of the station has sustained severe damage. Layne says the facility will remain closed for the day and crews will respond from neighouring fire stations. He says in addition to the Fire Station, the Fizeka offices at the rear of the station was also set alight and one office section sustained severe damage. He says: “Firefighters from Mitchell’s Plain Fire Station responded to the incident but due to blocked roadways caused by protesters burning tyres, they had to take a long detour in order to get to the Gugulethu Fire Station.”
