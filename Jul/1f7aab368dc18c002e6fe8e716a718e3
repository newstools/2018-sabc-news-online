Opposition leader Nelson Chamisa of the Movement for Democratic Change has welcomed former President Robert Mugabe‘s decision to vote for the MDC. Mugabe aired his views on the eve of Zimbabwe’s elections, saying he would not be voting for current Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa. The former President states categorically he cannot vote for those that tormented him, referring to ZANU-PF. Chamisa says he does not have any problem receiving one more vote. “I have nothing to do with what President Mugabe would want to say as a voter,  he’s a citizen it’s not my duty as a candidate to go and choose voters we are not going to this election to choose voters , we are going to be chosen,  so if someone votes in my favor who am I to deny that extra vote. The more the merrier, you don’t choose and you don’t discriminate against voters.” Click below for more on Zimbabwe’s elections:
