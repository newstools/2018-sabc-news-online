Hartswater residents in the Northern Cape marched to demand the closure of foreign owned shops. This after police closed a factory of counterfeit goods in the area earlier this month. Goods worth R77 million were confiscated. Residents say enough is enough. They believe counterfeit goods, being sold by foreigners, are a health hazard. A resident Sarah Arends says: “It’s unfortunately sad that residents can’t afford shops in town, hence they buy at tuck shops which are not safe.” They want the municipality to act against the culprits. An organiser Tebogo Mwali says they shouldn’t be taken for granted and steps should be taken by the municipality. Residents request samples of goods sold at the tuck shops to be collected and verified. The municipality is expected to respond within seven days. All the demands will be discussed during a council meeting next week.
