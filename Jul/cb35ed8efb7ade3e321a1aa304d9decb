The United Democratic Movement (UDM) says unless Duduzane Zuma and Dudu Myeni appear before Parliament, the party will pursue criminal charges against them. The UDM has written to National Assembly Speaker Baleka Mbete to try and persuade her to re-issue subpoenas for them to appear. The party believes Zuma and Myeni face serious allegations of being involved in state capture and says Parliament must now do all it can to hear their side of the story. Zuma, Myeni and Gupta brothers Ajay and Atul failed to appear before Parliament’s Inquiry into state capture at Eskom earlier this year despite receiving a summons to do so. At the time Zuma was living in Dubai. The UDM says now that Zuma is back in the country, it is incumbent on Parliament to hear his response to the allegations. If the institution fails to do so, the party will lay criminal charges in a bid to hear his version of events. “If they fail to heed our call as the UDM, we are going to make sure that we are going to open criminal cases against Duduzile Myeni and Duduzane Zuma to make sure that they indeed account to the South African public about their role in the looting of state resources and the role they played when working together in cahoots with the Guptas to loot state resources,”  says UDM Chief Whip  Nqabayomzi Kwankwa.
