The Zimbabwean government says at this stage nothing threatens the credibility of national elections scheduled for July 30. However, the country’s opposition parties say they will not allow elections to go ahead if the vote is not free and fair. It is the final countdown to Zimbabwe’s landmark elections, the first without Robert Mugabe. The run-up to this election has not been without its colourful features, including thousands of fake names, duplicates and dead people who are registered to cast their ballots. The voter’s roll is still a big talking point and it is the one thing the opposition say holds the credibility of this election. The Zimbabwe Electoral Commission says preparations are in place ahead of the presidential elections on Monday. The front-runners in the make or break vote are current President Emmerson Mnangagwa of the Zanu-PF and the Movement for Democratic Change’s Nelson Chamisa.
