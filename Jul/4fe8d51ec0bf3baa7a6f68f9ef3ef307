A Pretoria man accused of murdering his wife has confessed to dumping her body but denies killing her.  Prem Basdeo made the confession in his third statement to the police. Basdeo is currently applying for bail in the Pretoria Magistrate’s Court. His wife Dawn went missing in June 2018. Her husband reported her missing at the Brooklyn Police station. The 58-year-old has also been charged with perjury for lying to the police about the whereabouts of his wife’s body. 57 year old Basdeo mysteriously went missing on the morning of the 8th. Her car was found dumped in Soweto on the 10th. Basdeo admits to having dumped the car in Soweto so it would make it seem his wife was hijacked. He claims they had an altercation on the morning and Dawn tried to attack him with a knife. She allegedly then slipped on the bathroom floor injuring herself. He then went to dump the body at a veld in Pretoria East, but the police could not find the body at the veld where he said he had dumped the body. In 2004, Basdeo and his son Jordan were acquitted on a murder charge by the Durban High Court. He was charged with the murder of his first wife, Neetha. Her body was found in a shipping container with a single gunshot wound to the head.
