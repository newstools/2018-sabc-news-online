The ANC has won the by-election at Ward 9 in Bela-Bela municipality in Limpopo which was previously controlled by the DA. The ward became vacant after the resignation of a DA councillor. The governing party has now increased its majority to 10 seats in the 17-seat municipal council. ANC spokesperson Donald Selamolela says they are delighted by the outcome. He says the win affirms what the ANC has always said that Limpopo residents are our people. He says: “If you remember this is the ward that was actually belonging to the DA and as the ANC we are delighted that we have been able to reclaim yet another seat. This outcome increases our majority in the Bela Bela local municipality.”
