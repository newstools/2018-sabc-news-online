The City of Cape Town says average water usage in the city has dropped to below 500 million litres per day. The City says average water consumption for the past week decreased by 32 million and now stands at 498 million litres per day. Dam levels have also improved slightly to nearly 57% although there’s been a little rain recently. Cape Town Deputy Mayor Ian Neilson has urged residents to continue with their water savings efforts until all the dams are fully recovered. “The fact that our consumption over the past week was less than 500 million litres a day shows how important it is for us all to manage that which we can control such as how much water we use and what we use it for. We need to ensure that we do everything in our power to help our dams recover as much as possible so that we are prepared for the summer months ahead.” Watch the video below for related news on the Cape Town water crisis:
