Eskom says it will pursue Trillian Capital through the courts to pay back a portion of the R1.6 billion which they received unlawfully from the power utility in 2016. Eskom has welcomed McKinsey’s repayment of over R900 million and the apology made by McKinsey & its Global Managing Partner, Kevin Sneader to the people of South Africa on Monday at the University of Pretoria’s Gordon Institute of Business Science (GIBS). Eskom says apparent lapses in their governance processes coupled with improprieties around and mismanagement of their procurement process led to a loss of trust in Eskom, its processes and its people. Eskom spokesperson, Khulu Phasiwe says since Trillian has not been party to the settlement, it will be pursued for the recovery of the remainder of the payments through the legal review process together with the National Prosecuting Authority. “We welcome the fact that McKinsey has done the right thing, they have apologized to South Africans and importantly they have now made the payment of R902 million. So the only other party for now is not coming to the party is the Trillian group. We will continue to pursue them through the courts because unfortunately they have not said anything, whether they are going to pay the money or not. So Eskom has made it very clear that the R1.6 billion that was paid to McKinsey and Trillion was done so unlawfully.”
