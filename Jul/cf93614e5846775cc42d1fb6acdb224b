Transport Minister Blade Nzimande says there’s no doubt that the recent attacks on Metrorail trains are arson. Nzimande visited a train depot in Paadeneiland in Cape Town following the recent spate of incidents which left at least 12 train carriages gutted. In Thursday’s incident at the Retreat Station, five coaches were destroyed and overhead cables damaged. The estimated damage of this incident stands at R21-million. Nzimande says certain legislation needs to be reviewed regarding the arson act. “One thing that I have heard from the police which shocked me, is that arson, which is what this is, only applies to fixed buildings… so if you burn a train it’s not categorised as arson. Yet this is actually arson, and arson is treated much more seriously in our law – so we have to look at legislation. how do we tighten this up.” Watch for more:
