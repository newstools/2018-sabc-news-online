The Hawks have confirmed that one of South Africa’s most wanted suspects in the cash in transit heists has been arrested during a crime intelligence driven operation in Bloemfontein. The arrest took place Thursday night. Hawks spokesperson, Hangwani Mulaudzi says the cash in transit heist king pin Wellington Cenenda is linked to at least 23 heists across Mpumalanga ‚Gauteng, North West and Limpopo provinces. “Today [Friday] he was taken directly to Mpumalanga in Delmas where he appeared in Delmas high court. He is in custody as we speak. The investigations on the suspect itself are still continuing. We do believe that he might have been involved in other serious crimes, therefore we are satisfied with all the suspects that have been apprehended, some of them  are already serving jail time,” says Mulaudzi.
