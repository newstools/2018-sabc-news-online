Nedbank Spokesperson Elelwani Pandelani says most VBS customers visiting Nedbank lack proper documents to withdraw or transfer their money. Hundreds of  VBS customers are visiting Nedbank branches in Thohoyandou and Louis Trichardt to either get their cash or transfer it to other banks. Nedbank says the process will take three years, but many people visited the banks on Friday morning. Pandelani says several people have been sent back home to collect relevant documents. “What we have encountered this morning is that, the bulk of the people that came in, did not have the necessary documentation that we requested. We requested that people should come with proof of residence, with ID book and if it’s a club they should also bring the constitution of the club and ensure that all the signatories are present. Some of them came with only two of three. So, we are appealing to the masses: ‘please, make sure that you have all relevant documentation including all the required parties,’” says Pandelani. Meanwhile, some VBS clients have decided to go back home after learning that the process will take three years. They’ve also got cellphone messages from Nedbank confirming that their accounts are now with the bank. Judith Makuya from Ha-Makuya village is one the satisfied customers. “I now understand the process. I got a message which indicated my account balance. I got confirmation that it has been transferred from VBS to Nedbank and I am now going back home. I was told that I should come back at a later stage with two other signatories and I understand it,” says Makuya. The police have also warned VBS clients to avoid carrying large sumps of money.
