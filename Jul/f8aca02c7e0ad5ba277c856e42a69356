The State Capture Commission is expected to present its update on Friday. Commission Chairperson Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo will address the media in a Johannesburg at midday. The briefing follows a ruling of the High Court in Johannesburg to have the commissionâ€™s deadline extended by two years calculated from March the first. The remedial action of the State of Capture report of former Public Protector advocate Thuli Madonsela also recommended a period of 180 days. Last week, Justice Zondo filed an urgent application for an order to extend and on Monday he welcomed the North Gauteng High Court decision to extend by a further 24 months. The president and Public Protector among others have to show cause why the period should not be extended, but Justice Zondo is expected to shed light on the response the Commission has received since it opened for submissions.
