The King of Amazulu, Goodwill Zwelithini, says he will not be silenced on the land issues involving the Ingonyama Trust. The king was addressing church congregants at the KwaDlamahlahla palace in Nongoma in northern KwaZulu Natal. The King of Amazulu is the longest serving monarch. He’s been working closely with the church to maintain peace and stability. The King says he will use peaceful means to protect land belonging to the Ingonyama Trust but won’t keep quiet if people threaten to take it. The King of Amazulu has also urged people who disagree with him to respect him. Parishioners presented the King with a gift to mark his 70th birthday. The King has also pledged to donate R70 000 each year to the church. Related video click below:
