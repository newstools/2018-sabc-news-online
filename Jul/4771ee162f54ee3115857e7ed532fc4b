Lawyers for suspended South African Revenue Service (SARS) Commissioner, Tom Moyane, say President Cyril Ramaphosa has indicated that he will wait for the outcome in Moyane’s disciplinary inquiry – headed by Advocate Azar Bham – before making a decision on demands put to him. Moyane was responding to Ramaphosa’s letter, after he initially requested that the investigation into management at SARS, chaired by retired Judge Robert Nugent, be stopped. Witnesses have already made damning allegations about Moyane’s leadership at SARS since he took over in September 2014. Moyane is also facing a disciplinary hearing after being suspended. Moyane’s attorney Eric Mabuza addressed the media in Johannesburg on Monday. “Now the President seems to look at this matter with a well-considered view, to say perhaps let me get the benefit of Bham before I make up my mind. We will discuss with our client if we receive further instructions, we will take both the Bham process and the Nugent process on review – so that its one consolidated review. The President says there won’t be any processes until the 21st… The President might as well have told us to take him to court, but the President adopted a very sensible approach, in our view, where he says he will await the outcome of Bham.”  Watch videos below:
