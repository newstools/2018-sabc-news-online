The decision by the Democratic Alliance (DA) in Cape Town to withdraw a motion of no confidence in Cape Town Mayor Patricia De Lille has had several political experts weigh in on the matter. The motion was expected to be brought during a full council meeting on Thursday. De Lille has recently won a High Court application challenging her expulsion from the party and narrowly survived a previous motion no confidence. She has been embroiled in allegations of maladministration in the council which she is denied. Political analyst Sanusha Naidoo believes the DA’s 11th hour decision to can the most recent motion is an effort to restore its reputation ahead of next year’s elections. She says: “To a greater extent I think perhaps the DA itself realised the reputational risk that this involves with the election looming in the near future and how this is going to impact on it’s own branding because there’s been talks and indications that the DA in certain parts of the Western Cape and other areas have lost particular levels of party support.” Related video below
