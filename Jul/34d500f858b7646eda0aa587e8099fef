The South African Broadcasting Corporation‘s (SABC) public consultations into the review of its Editorial Policy has heard calls for a more balanced and fair coverage of all languages, religious and indigenous content in its television and radio platforms. The second leg of these consultations wrapped up in Johannesburg on Tuesday. The SABC has been to all provinces to source the public’s input on its revised Editorial policy which was last reviewed in 2004. SABC Policy and Regulatory Affairs General Manager, Philly Moilwa is adamant that the move from analog to digital broadcasting will also help overcome some of the challenges. “We are committing as the SABC. We are saying we need to provide quality education that is appealing to the masses; and we need to have educational programmes that are also linked to our priorities. “Where are we going as a country; what is our policy around education? Then universal access still stands. Remember, in the past we were saying 80% coverage of this. We are now entering a full channel environment and we are doing that with DTH.” Click below for more on the story:
