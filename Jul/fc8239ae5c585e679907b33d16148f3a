Minister of Communications, Nomvula Mokonyane has launched a review of the public broadcasting policy. Members of the public as well as other stakeholders have been invited to submit proposals. The review hopes to come up with innovative ways of looking at broadcasting in South Africa particularly the mandate of the SABC. The entire process should take at least three months. Mokonyane says although this review comes at a very late stage, it is necessary. She says: ‘We have to reposition ourselves in line with the 4th industrial revolution and make sure that we up our capacities including the manner in which we package our own means of communication and the tools of trade that we are using.” “The second one has to be about contributing to the South Africa that we want, where we contribute towards making sure that a public broadcaster becomes an anchor in terms of growing the economy, building new skills and most importantly uniting the people of South Africa and the promotion of social cohesion,” she adds.
