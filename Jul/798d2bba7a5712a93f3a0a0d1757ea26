Knysna Municipal Manager, Kam Chetty, has resigned from his position – a year after taking up the reins. The 59-year-old administrator, who is highly respected by his peers, has cited personal reasons for leaving the embattled local authority. Recently Knysna has seen the toppling of the DA from power after two of its councillors voted with the ANC during a vote of no confidence motion against its former mayor, Eleonore Bouw-Spies. Chetty is known for turning around the Oudtshoorn Municipality in the Little Karoo at a time when it was riddled with instability and near collapse. Newly elected Knysna Mayor, Mark Willemse  says a new manager will be appointed in due time
