The trial of Fees Must Fall activist Bonginkosi Khanyile continues in the Durban Regional Court on Thursday. The state has levelled several serious charges against Khanyile, including inciting public violence, possession of explosives, contravention of the Gatherings Act, possession of a dangerous weapon, failure to comply with police orders, common assault as well as hindering traffic. The majority of the charges against Khanyile relate to his leadership during a fees must fall protest action at the Durban University of Technology in September 2016. Khanyile was denied bail on several occasions and was only released after taking his matter to the Constitutional Court. He spent six months in jail during this period. The Legal Aid lawyer, who was representing Khanyile, withdrew on Wednesday. The court has given him until Thursday to find a new lawyer who is ready to represent him in a trial or he has to represent himself.
