The Minister of International Relations and Cooperation, Lindiwe Sisulu, will on Friday, host the Venezuelan Minister of Foreign Affairs, Jorge Arreaza. This visit takes place after the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela held its Presidential elections on 20, May last year. The election saw the re-election of President Nicolas Maduro as the Head of State and the re-appointment of Minister Arreaza to the portfolio of Foreign Affairs. The Department of International Relations (Dirco) says the visit will be used as an opportunity to continue to strengthen the existing bilateral relations between South Africa and Venezuela, specifically on the areas of mutual interest. These include Trade and Investment, Agriculture, Energy, Transport, Mining, Tourism and consular matters. Diplomatic relations between South Africa and the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela were established in 1993 and in 1995. The two countries share cordial relations, mainly political.
