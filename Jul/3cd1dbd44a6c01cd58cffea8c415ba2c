The inclusion of two controversial former Gauteng Health MECs, Qedani Mahlangu and Brian Hlongwa in the African National Congress (ANC) PEC, has overshadowed the announcement of the party’s new provincial leadership. Mahlangu was fingered in the tragic deaths of the Life Esidimeni mentally-ill patients while Hlongwa is facing an investigation for alleged corruption. Newly-elected ANC provincial chairperson David Makhura says, “The leadership that is elected will do so. I think it’s important to emphasise the conference conducts its own processes depending on what is before it. So the integrity committee has been working on this as well.” “Someone was saying I am defending Brian – we are dealing with principle here. The integrity committee has been called upon by the conference to finalise these matters immediately – will deal with these two matters,” adds Makhura.
