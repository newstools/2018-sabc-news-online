Two rival African National Congress (ANC) elective conferences were held at the Ruth Mompati region in the North West on Saturday. The Taung conference members argued that they are the legitimate delegates who were denied access to attend the conference in Christiana. While the ANC’s national leadership is advocating for unity and cohesion within the party in the North West province, this seems to be far from being realised. This as the Dr Ruth Segomotsi Mompati Region held two parallel elective conferences. Those barred from participating in the conference in Christiana, convened their own in Taung late Saturday night. ANC PEC member Mmoloki Cwaile says: “Delegates that have been chosen by the branches are at PH Mooketsi high school. So this will be the only conference that we have in Dr Ruth Segomotsi Mompati region. For more than five years, we have not been having leadership in this region. So we cannot have conferences or the leadership that denies people an opportunity to be part of the governance.” Delegates at the Taung conference accused those at the Christiana conference of factionalism. Spokesperson for disgruntled members Thapelo Galeboe says: “That was not the regional conference it was a factional gathering led by factional leaders. Comrade Sylvia Lucas knows exactly that the valid delegates from branches of the ANC were not part of that conference. That conference was just a factional cadres forum where a clique that is pro Supra Mahumapelo was there to declare their support that they are behind him.” The ANC provincial leadership will only comment on the matter on Monday after their regular officials meeting.
