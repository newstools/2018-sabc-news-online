National Police Spokesperson Vish Naidoo says security forces are continuing their investigations into the fatal shooting of 11 people by unknown gunmen in KwaZulu-Natal over the weekend. The incident occurred on the R74 between Colenso and Weenen in KZN on Saturday evening. Over 200 bullet holes were found on the taxi. Naidoo says the motive for the shooting is still not known. He says, “We are very heavily reliant on where our investigations will take us, both in terms of establishing the motive as well as establishing who is responsible for the attack on Saturday night. Basically the plan is to mobilise resources from crime intelligence, the Hawks, general detectives, our special task force and other specialised units. These officers gather evidence, information and try to establish who is responsible for incidents like this one.”
