South Africa has a new life line to boost its declining domestic tourism figures, the Makhonjwa Mountains in Mpumalanga, known as the Barberton Greenstone Belt, were recently declared a World Heritage site by UNESCO. The mountains are some of the world’s oldest geological sites and boast the best preserved volcanic and rock formations dating back 3.8-billion years.  A journey along the R40 road – on the south eastern side of the Capital, Mbombela, leads adventurers to Barberton. The town’s entrance is eye-catching and unique. A drive along the winding road for some 37 kilometres reveals breathtaking scenic beauty. Rock formations along the Barberton Greenstone Belt, plaques illustrate useful information to tourists visiting the area. Tourists with any form of disability are also catered for. One of rocks, the Black Chert is described to have been formed about 3.3 billion years ago. For the project owners, it was never an easy journey to get the Makhonjwa Mountains onto the world map.
