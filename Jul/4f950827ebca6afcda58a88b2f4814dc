A National Youth Festival is being hosted at the historic Morris Isaacson High School in Soweto. It’s aimed at getting the youth involved in church activities and to remind them of the history of the country. The keynote address was delivered by the Minister of communications, Nomvula Mokonyane. For the young people in the school, it is an opportunity to celebrate culture and religion. Mokonyane says: “It’s about national pride and identity. No self-respecting individual can be proud of their religious beliefs without first appreciating their African heritage.” The iconic Morris Isaacson School in Soweto was chosen as the venue to remind the youth of the sacrifices made by the students of 1976. “The aim is to bring young people from across the country to come re-live and see where history was made in terms of the students of yesteryear, and also to appreciate what the future looks like as we are engaging with them on various government plans,” Mokonyane explained. The festival also focused on child protection, nation building and social cohesion.
