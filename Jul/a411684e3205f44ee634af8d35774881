Police Minister Bheki Cele has committed himself into restoring stability at Zwelihle in Hermanus in the Overstrand in the Western Cape. Cele has called for united action to deal with the situation. He was addressing a stakeholders meeting in the area, discussing ways on how to deal with the ongoing violent protests at Zwelihle. A member of the police’s Public Order Policing unit was robbed of his firearm during violent protests in Zwelihle township on Thursday night. A group of rioters assaulted the officer with an axe, injuring his head severely and taking both his firearms. Western Cape Police Commissioner, Khombinkosi Jula, says the officer’s shotgun was recovered, but not his pistol. Jula says the second officer is unharmed, while the other is in hospital recovering. “One of our members was struck in the face with an axe. That member was transported to hospital where he has undergone an operation. We then stepped up our visibility and operations. We have searched for the suspects and firearms. Out of the three firearms that were dispossessed from our members, two shotguns and a hand gun, so far we’ve recovered a shot gun and arrested two suspects,” says Jula.
