Some residents of Hermanus, in the Overstrand Municipality, say they feel as if they are being held hostage by a group of people who only want to damage to the town. This after violent protests erupted in the Zwelihle informal settlement in Hermanus over the last few days, resulting in damage to various buildings and the shutdown of businesses in the area. The protesters are calling for the release of their community leaders, after they were arrested earlier in the week. More than 40 people have been arrested in connection with the unrest. Hermanus resident, Paula Day says the protests are crippling the town. “I’ve grown up here. My children have been raised here, and I find it extremely sad to see the community being held hostage by a handful of people that have malicious intentions. It’s just not acceptable. It has to stop, because it’s crippling Hermanus.”
