ANC President Cyril Ramaphosa has concluded his busy weekend visit to KwaZulu-Natal. After meeting with the King of the Amazulu, Goodwill Zwelithini on Friday, he visited the KwaDukuza and Groutville communities and the victims and families of the Ottawa Mosque attack in which one person was killed in May this year. Speaking at the provincial Thuma Mina campaign launch at Groutville on Saturday, Ramaphosa emphasised unity among both leaders and members of the ANC. He says the hopes of ordinary people are pinned on the ANC and that the party needs to serve the people. He says: “We face a number of challenges and these challenges want us to be united. We must work with integrity and it requires all of us to work together and it is requires that we must all make a contribution. The campaign that we have launched can make things better for our people.” “Our people rely on us as ANC to improve their lives. Comrades there is no other political party that can improve the lives of the people of South Africa,” adds Ramaphosa.
