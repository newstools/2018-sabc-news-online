Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs Minister Zweli Mkhize has called on people to respect the decision of the Kimberley High Court that Sol Plaatjie Mayor Mangaliso Matika must vacate office until the August the 22nd. This follows violent protests from residents in Galeshewe in Kimberley, calling for Matika to step down. Mkhize says the ANC in the province will engage community members on the matter. Meanwhile, Galeshewe residents have decided to call off protests. The community has agreed to start with a clean up operation of the township. They say they are content with the courtâ€™s decision.
