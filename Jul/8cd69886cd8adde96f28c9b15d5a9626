The National Prosecuting Authority says Duduzane Zuma followed all the conditions of his bail before travelling abroad. Former president Jacob Zuma’s son reportedly flew to Dubai on Friday to spend time with his pregnant wife. He was released on R100-thousand bail by the Johannesburg Specialised Crimes Court after being formally charged with corruption for allegedly trying to bribe then Deputy Finance Minister Mcebisi Jonas in October 2015. His culpable homicide case in the Randburg Magistrate’s Court has been postponed to August the 23rd. In this case he’s charged with two counts of culpable homicide after his luxury car crashed into a taxi on the M1 highway in Johannesburg killing two women. NPA Gauteng spokesperson Phindi Mjonondwana says, “As per bail conditions that were agreed in court, was that he is allowed to travel, but however before making those travel arrangements, he needs to get permission with the investigation officer, so that he can be given his passport as and when he needs to travel. So we can confirm as the NPA that he followed due processes, hence he was allowed to travel.”
