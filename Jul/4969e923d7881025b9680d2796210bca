Environmental organisation Greenpeace Africa has criticised China for its R33-billion loan to Eskom to develop the Kusile power station. In a statement, Greenpeace says it’s disappointed that China would choose to support what it calls “dirty coal” in a country like South Africa. Greenpeace Africa Senior Political Advisor Happy Khambule says this loan should have been used for renewable energy. “The world is moving away from coal. This loan that we’ve got should have been used for renewable energy, it should have been used for something which is a lot more progressive and looking forward. With China taking the stance that it has taken in the international community, it seems like double-speech, looking at the fact that coal is the key contributor to climate change.” Watch for more:
