Over 1000 elderly people received free medical health care  services in Mbombela Mpumalanga on Saturday. Thanks to an initiative by a group of medical doctors operating in the province, aimed at taking the Madiba legacy forward. Services provided to the elderly ranged from eye testing, checking of sugar and blood pressure levels. “I came here because I have got a problem. I cannot see properly and I know that I will get help here,” says one of the beneficiaries. “I am very happy today. They checked my eyes and did almost everything for free. I now have spectacles for free,” adds another one. All services were provided free in the spirit of former President Nelson Mandela. “We are very passionate about our people. We said we must come together to help out especially the elderly in celebration of the centenary of Madiba. We are ploughing back to the community,” says Medical Practitioner, Dr. Bongile Baloi.” “The need for help is huge you can see, so we must do something to help out,” says Optometrist, Dr Abraham Varghese.” For beneficiaries, this will remain a memorable day.They are going back home, having received much needed assistance. A service some could not have been able to afford. The medical practitioners who have been giving out help  say they will be taking the initiative to other provinces. They have urged others to contribute in changing lives, which something that was very close to Madiba’s heart. WATCH BELOW:
