Two more explosive devices have been found at different places in Durban on Sunday. Police spokesperson Nqobile Gwala says the first explosive device was found under a car in Marriot Road, while the second one was found at Milner Road in Avondale. On Saturday the Woolworths store in Gateway  had to be evacuated and cordoned off after a second suspected bomb-like device was found in the store. A similar device was also detonated in the Woolworth store in the Pavilion Mall last week, causing a small fire. Gwala says no one was injured in both incidents as the devices did not detonate. “The charges of contravening of the explosives acts are being investigated by the Berea police. The first incident took place at Marriot Road where an unknown device was found under the vehicle and the second incident took place at Avondale in Milner Road where another device was found. The explosive unit members were summoned to the scene to investigate and both devices did not explode and investigations are still continuing,” says Gwala.
