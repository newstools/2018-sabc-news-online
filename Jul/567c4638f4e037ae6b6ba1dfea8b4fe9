Former Science and Technology Minister, Naledi Pandor who spearheaded the MeerKAT telescope, says she is proud to see that the hard work paid off. The 64-dish MeerKAT array was officially launched at Carnarvon in the Northern Cape earlier on Friday. The telescope is the largest until the Square Kilometre Array has been completed. Pandor says the launch of the project is a step in the right direction. “As we make progress with the South African part and moving to SKA one, the other eight countries on the African continent become as core part of the initiative. So when you talk about projects, often it is imagination, and actually seeing the real achievement that we celebrating today is extremely exciting for South Africans and well done.” Watch related video below:
