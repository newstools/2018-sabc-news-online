Northern Cape Premier Sylvia Luca, has called an urgent meeting with the Mayor of the Sol Plaatje Municipality in Kimberley, Mangaliso Matika, in a bid to diffuse tensions in Galeshewe, Greenpoint and Roodepan. The city has been on lock down following protests that erupted on Thursday. Residents are demanding lower electricity tariffs and the resignation of the municipal manager and chief financial officer. The Premier has called for calm in the area until they can resolve the residents’ grievances. “We want to call on those that are responsible for the destruction, but also for those that were the leaders for the protest action to please to become calm. I have just spoken to the mayor, and I requested him that we as soon as possible come together to work on a solution for what is going on.”
