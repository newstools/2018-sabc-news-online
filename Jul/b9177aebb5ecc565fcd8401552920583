ANC Treasurer General Paul Mashatile says the party believes Eskom needs to be divided into three divisions to enable effective and efficient functioning. Mashatile says unless this is done, the power utility will continue to be in deep financial trouble. Eskom has reported that its debt had increased by 50% during the 2017/18 financial year. Mashathile says the party plans to engage Eskom’s leadership on the matter. He says: “Our view is that you need to break Eskom into three pieces. Company doing production, another one doing transmission and the last one distribution.” “We have realised that countries that have been able in sorting out their electricity have actually done the divisions. Otherwise you have this big animal that is not able to function.”
