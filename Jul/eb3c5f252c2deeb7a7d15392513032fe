Gautrain commuters have been advised to find alternative transport as workers will embark on a strike on Monday. The workers who will down tools are affiliated with the United National Transport Union. This comes as wage negotiations deadlock between the Bombela Concession Company, the operator of the Gautrain and the union. Union General-Secretary, Steve Harris says,” The strikes resumes while the parties could not reach an agreement… we deadlocked again. We deadlocked at 10 per cent. The company is offering 8.5 per cent. However there are crucial issues such as housing allowance and transport allowance. One major issue is that the employees are insisting to share in the profits of the company, because the managers are sharing in the profits of the company.”
