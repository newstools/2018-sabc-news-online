Gautrain commuters are being left stranded following a strike action by workers from Monday morning. Workers affiliated to the United National Transport Union (UNTU) demand a wage increase of 10%, while the employer is offering 8.5%. Gautrain commuters are being turned away at the Sandton station.  Commuters boarding to the airport are forced to use meter taxis. Some say they were never told about the strike. Meter taxi operators say the strike will also affect them as they transport people mostly from the trains to different destinations around Johannesburg The Gautrain management have put a board next to the entrance of the train station with the message that the train service will be reduced.  A limited number of trains will run during peak hours only and no trains will run during off-peak hours. At this stage, it is not clear how long the strike will last.
