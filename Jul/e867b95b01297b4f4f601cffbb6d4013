The Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) says it supports land expropriation, however with compensation. This transpired earlier on Tuesday when the party held a media briefing in Durban. The party says the land under the Ingonyama Trust Board is already in the hands of Africans hence there is no need to expropriate it. IFP Chairperson of the National Campaign Committee Narend Singh outlined their party position on much talked about land expropriation. “On the land issue, the IFP policy as we stand today, we believe in expropriation. It is necessary to expropriate for certain public practices, but we say expropriate with compensation and we need to be really convinced by the public hearings. We have not analysed at this moment in time or anybody else that we need to change our position.” The IFP has once again called for the suspension of the fuel levy to ease the burden of petrol price on motorists. The party says the numerous petrol hikes in 2018 alone has put pressure on the pockets of many South Africans. Speaking during at the briefing in Durban, party Spokesperson Mkhuleko Hlengwa says they have called on President Cyril Ramaphosa to provide a relief package to assist motorists. “The IFP is concerned about the escalating fuel prices. There was a fuel levy increase in April, of 52 cents; there was a VAT increase; there have been six fuel price increases this year already. Tomorrow  (Wednesday) there is another fuel hike which is on the cards, taking the price of petrol to over R16 which is unprecedented in South Africa. “We have called on the President of South Africa to present a relief package to South Africans on how are we going to deal with this, but that has not happened. South Africans pay levies  of a R5.30 per litre and we are calling for a suspension of this indirect and regressive tax until such time prices of petrol have stabilised,” Singh said.
