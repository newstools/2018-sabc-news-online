The much-anticipated African National Congress KwaZulu-Natal conference is expected to kick off later on Thursday in Durban. The registration area is abuzz with ANC leaders and a handful of delegates clad in party colours. Last month the elective conference was halted by the Pietermaritzburg high court after some party members approached the court. They claimed there had been interference in some regions including Lower South, Moses Mabhida and Harry Gwala. The court last year also ruled that the results of the November 2015 elective conference had been unlawful.

The PTT and the members that had taken the party to court last week announced that they had settled their differences for the sake of a unified party in the province. Watch for more:
