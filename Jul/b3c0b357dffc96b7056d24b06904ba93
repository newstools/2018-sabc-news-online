Vote counting is now underway in Zimbabwe and the election results are expected to be released soon. The election is seen as a two-horse race between 75-year-old President Emmerson Mnangagwa and 40-year-old Nelson Chamisa of the opposition MDC alliance. The turnout in Zimbabwe’s election on Monday, the first since the removal of former President Robert Mugabe , was about 75% larger than the last vote in 2013. Zimbabwe Electoral commission (ZEC) authorities say in their view the high voter turnout is indicative of sound voter education and publicity conducted on a receptive electorate. ZEC’s Provincial Elections Officer in Bulawayo, Innocent Ncube, says there were no reports of violence but complaints were reported at some polling stations which resulted in them closing late. Meanwhile, exiled Zimbabwean author and journalist Peter Godwin says the ZEC appears to be very close to the government and suggested this could have ramifications for a Movement of Democratic Change victory. He was speaking to SABC NEWS from his home in New York when asked if this election could herald in a new dawn for Zimbabwe. Related videos below
