A power blackout in a Kenyan court has forced the judge to adjourn a bail application hearing for 14 top officials of the country’s power utility firm, Kenya Power. Company CEO Ken Tarus, his predecessor Ben Chuma and several other top officials have been charged with conspiring to commit an economic crime and abuse of office. They are accused of entering into a contract with a private firm for the supply of transformers, which were faulty. Prosecutors say the tendering process was against the country’s procurement laws. Officials of the company who got the contract were also charged in court on Monday. The energy ministry moved fast to replace those in court and promised that operations at the company would not be affected.
