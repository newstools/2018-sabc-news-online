Nedbank says the number of consumers visiting its selected branches to access money, which had been initially invested with VBS Mutual Bank is slowly declining. Nebank’s provincial general manager for Limpopo and Mpumalanga, Loderick Lubisi says about 20% of the clients have been assisted since the bank took over VBS’s private accounts about two weeks ago. Lubisi has encouraged clients to continue visiting selected branches. He says some of the clients have opted to retain their funds with the bank. “We’ve had a gradual steady decline in terms of specific individuals coming through to the branches to access their money. We started off with an average of about 300 people a day – it has actually come down to 240 – so people are not streaming into the branches.” “As once, initially you know certainly from a Nedbank point of view – we are finding that of the clients that we have assisted there is a very good representation of those who are retaining their money.” Related video click below:
