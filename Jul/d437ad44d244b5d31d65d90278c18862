The National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa has rejected the proposal by government to make transportation an essential service. The union says this is an attempt to undermine workers’ right to strike. Numsa spokesperson Phakamile Hlubi-Majola says they will approach the CCMA to make presentations on the matter on Friday. “We see this process as another way that this government is trying to take away the hard won right of the working class to strike. We will be at the CCMA to make our presentations to the committee. We must be there to defend the right to strike. We will not allow this government to utilise another process to attack the working class.”
