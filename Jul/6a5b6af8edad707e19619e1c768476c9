SABC manager for regulatory affairs, Judy Monyela says it’s imperative for the public broadcaster to engage the public as it seeks to make amendment to its editorial policy. She was speaking after public consultations on the SABC editorial policy review in Bloemfontein on Wednesday. A lack of professionalism in journalism and poor language use were some of the issues highlighted. Monyela says the public broadcaster’s current editorial policy was last reviewed in 2004. She says the next step will be to analyse all submissions and submit to the board for approval. She says: “Thereafter we will file with Icasa for compliance mainly because we are a public broadcaster and exist for members of the public and the law further says we need to be responsive to the needs of our audience. So whatever that we broadcast on our radio or television platforms has to be approved by members of the public.”
