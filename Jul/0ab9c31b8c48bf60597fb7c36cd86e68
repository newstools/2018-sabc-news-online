There are growing concerns that the decision by Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo to request for an extension of the sitting of the Judicial Commission of Inquiry into allegations of state capture, could prolong the process to unmask and punish those guilty of aiding and abetting acts of looting of public resources. Zondo, who is the chair of the Commission, has approached the North Gauteng High Court for an extension of the six months period initially set for the completion of his probe. From the time when Zondo released the State Capture Inquiry terms of reference earlier this year, he made it clear that the six months period stipulated by the former Public Protector Advocate Thuli Mandonsela will not be sufficient. The Pretoria High Court has now granted an order for the extension of the commissionâ€™s work for a period of 24 months with effect from March 1 this year. The Commission must also investigate the veracity of allegations that former Deputy Finance Minister Mcebisi Jonas and former African National Congress MP Vytjie Mentor were offered cabinet positions by the Gupta family.
