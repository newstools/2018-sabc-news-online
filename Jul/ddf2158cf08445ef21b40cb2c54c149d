Unions at Eskom say the next wage talks scheduled for Tuesday would be critical to determine whether a deal is possible or not. Eskom upped its wage offer to 7 percent on Friday which was rejected by Unions, who had earlier also turned down the offer of 6.7 percent. National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) Deputy-General Secretary William Mabapa says all parties are determined to reach a settlement as soon as possible. Mabapa says, “We are not taking anything to the members because we didn’t finish the discussions. The venue was booked for other activities. But during the discussions I can confirm that Eskom gave us a revised offer of 7 percent that we have rejected.”
