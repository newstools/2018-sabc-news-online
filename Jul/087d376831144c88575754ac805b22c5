City of Tshwane says it estimates that power in Pretoria areas will be restored only after three days. Wapadrand, Equestria, Silver Lakes and Faerie Glen are still without electricity following the burning incident at a power sub-station on Tuesday night. Traffic lights are also not working in affected areas.  The city’s technicians are on site hard at work in an attempt to restore power as speedily as possible.  Meanwhile, businesses and households say prolonged power outage is costing them. Resident Jacque van der Westhuizen says power outage is affecting them severely. “We are sitting without electricity, it is winter and there’s no warm hot water and I think is affecting more other people especially people in the area who are sitting with small children and babies. So currently where I’m staying you do tend to see that most of the people are sharing generators from neighbour to neighbour just to get warm water. I think the most important thing is that the City of Tshwane must tell us exactly how long it is going to take.”
