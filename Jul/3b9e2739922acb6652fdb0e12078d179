Researchers at the University of Limpopo are at an advanced stage of producing marula wine as an alternative to grape wine. The university’s Biochemistry, Microbiology and Biotechnology department has been working with marula beer brewers in Mankweng, outside Polokwane. The department has also hosted several wine testing sessions and using suggestions to improve the beverage. According to researchers, wine is an alcoholic beverage made from fruits that have been fermented without the addition of sugar, acid, enzyme, water, or any other nutrients. Wine can be made from a wide variety of fruits, provided the fruit has sufficient sugar content to convert into alcohol during the fermentation process. The Biochemistry, Microbiology and Biotechnology department at the University of Limpopo in 2015 committed to creating the first, uniquely South African wine beverage, using the marula fruit. Senior lecturer at the department, Dr Kgabo Moganedi, says their research is aimed at finding ways to ensure that the marula beverage that’s already available in the market is packaged and preserved in a manner that will ensure that it doesn’t go stale but matures over time. Moganedi says they want to offer the wine in wide varieties and tastes.
