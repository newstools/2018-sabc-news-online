The National Union of Mineworkers says all unions at Eskom have vowed not to accept any wage offer below 8%. Eskom wage talks with NUM, National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa and Solidarity resumed on Tuesday. Last Friday the power utility tabled another revised offer of 7% which was turned down by unions. NUM says it’s hopeful that Eskom will table a new improved offer. “We as unions, NUM, Numsa and Solidarity are demanding an 8% in the first year, 8.5 % in the second year. Those are the increases and when it comes to housing allowance we are demanding a R500 first, R750 second year and third year. When it comes to bonus we are demanding 12% first year and 35% second year and third year,” says NUM spokesperson Livhuwani Mammburu. Watch for more:
