Ten people charged with blockading the N3 on Wednesday are due to appear in the Pietermaritzburg Magistrate’s Court on Thursday. Trucks had blockaded the N3 and some other roads in and around Durban as part of a petrol hike protest. Police spokesperson Jay Naicker has warned the public not to obstruct national highways because they will be arrested. The arrested people will be appearing in the Pietermaritzburg Magistrate’s Court on charges of public violence. Naicker says: “Our message is very clear from the acting provincial commissioner, there will be no negotiations with people blockading roads. They will be immediately arrested, detained, charged and taken to court.” “Any vehicle found blockading roads will be immediately towed away to the pound.” Meanwhile, Naicker says there were a few vehicles that again blockaded the N3 Thursday morning but police successfully removed them. “Police responded in the early hours of the morning and took immediate action. We responded immediately and vehicles were towed and roads were cleared as soon as possible,” says Naicker.
