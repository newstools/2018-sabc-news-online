Four political parties are contesting a by-election in Bela-Bela Limpopo on Tuesday. Ward 9 became vacant after a Democratic Alliance (DA) councillor resigned. The parties include the DA, the African National Congress (ANC), the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) and the Congress of the People (COPE). Head of the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) in the province Nkaro Mateta says operations are progressing smoothly and all voting stations have opened on time.
