The National Education Health and Allied Workers’ Union (Nehawu) says former Home Affairs Director-General, Mkhuseli Apleni should be held liable for bringing the department into disarray. Nehawu National Spokesperson, Khaya Xaba says Apleni, who resigned on Monday, should be charged following his alleged involvement in granting the Gupta family members citizenship, despite previous requests being denied. Minister Malusi Gigaba praised Apleni for his contribution to the department. However, Xaba believes Apleni’s departure will fix most of the problems at the department. He says, “Since it happened under his tenure, it was during leadership of the department that the Guptas were given natural status and he needs to come back then and account. He needs to come back and testify on how it happened, failure to do so, I think he should face the full might of the law.”
