The new Cosatu leadership in the Western Cape says they will challenge any further electricity hikes. Eskom is expected to request energy regulator NERSA for an additional tariff increase soon. The power utility requested an increase of nearly 20% in December last year, but NERSA only granted it 5%. Provincial Secretary, Malvern de Bruyn says the increases in petrol, food and electricity are hitting the poor the hardest. He says, “These increases are leading to households suffering the most and Cosatu is going to challenge NERSA and Eskom on it.” “The increase will have have a huge impact on the poor again and as Cosatu we are saying if NERSA does not reduce the tariffs, we will tackle them with a possible strike,” says de Bruyn.
