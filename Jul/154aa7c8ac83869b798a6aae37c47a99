Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (OUTA) COO Ben Theron says they are calling on people from all walks of life to come out in their numbers in Pretoria on Tuesday to handover a memorandum of demands to the Minister of Finance. There have been increases in all fuel types since the year began and South Africans have expressed concern. The Democratic Alliance and OUTA have joined the call to reduce fuel prices. Theron says fuel prices affect everybody whether you earning a salary or not. He says: What we are saying to the president is that the people are suffering, please lower the price of fuel. Fuel prices affect everything from taxi fares to the cost of food.” Meanwhile, People Against Petrol and Paraffin Price Increase (PAPPPI) have been mobilising for a national shut down in hopes that government will intervene. PAPPPI’s Visvin Reddy says people are paying the highest fuel price ever in South Africa and yet employers are reluctant to increase salaries. He asks, how are people expected to live, how are they expected to make ends meet? He says the proposals they have made to goverment include more use of Sasol fuel which is locally produced and secondly cutting down taxes on fuel. The fuel issue has become so topical that recently the Inkatha Freedom Party wrote to National Assembly Speaker Baleka Mbete requesting a debate on the matter in Parliament.
