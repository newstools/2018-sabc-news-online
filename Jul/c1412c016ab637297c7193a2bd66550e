The Communications Workers’ Unions(CWU) has warned that services at MTN could be affected as hundreds of its members embark on a strike. CWU says the negotiations with MTN have deadlocked prompting Friday’s strike. The union wants among others a 10% salary increase and a R2 500 housing subsidy. Union members will demonstrate at the MTN offices in Johannesburg and Bloemfontein. Aubrey Tshabalala is CWU’s general-secretary: “Our members at MTN are just above 1 000. We expect in general that majority if not all members will support the call. We do expect the stores, customer care, call centres and warehouses to be affected.”
