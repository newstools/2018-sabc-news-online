Eskom workers affiliated to the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) are sticking to their demand of a 9% wage increase. Wage negotiations are expected to resume in Johannesburg on Friday morning. The NUM took Eskom’s latest wage offer of 6.2% increase for 2018 and 6% for 2019 and 2020 to its members. NUM national spokesperson Livhuwani Mammburu says members demands stay the same despite Eskom’s offer. “Yesterday during our national shop Stewart council, the mandate from our members was saying that they were still demanding 9%, also want R1 000 in housing allowance and also the bonus. Those are things that are members want and they don’t want to hear anything.” Meanwhile Labour union Numsa says it will formally respond to Eskom’s latest wage offer during their meeting. Numsa has however denied reports that it has rejected Eskom offer. Numsa spokesperson, Phakamile Majola says, “We have been canvasing our members for the last week to get a response from them and we will formally communicate that response to Eskom when we meet with them today.” Watch related video below:
