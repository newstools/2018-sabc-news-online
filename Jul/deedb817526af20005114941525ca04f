The African National Congress (ANC) Provincial Task Team in KwaZulu-Natal says its long-awaited provincial elective conference will be held next weekend. Provincial Task Team co-ordinator Sihle Zikalala says both parties have agreed to address problems of the party internally. In June a group of disgruntled ANC branch members successfully interdicted the conference just hours before it was meant to sit. Branch members alleged that party leaders failed to resolve their issues. These unresolved issues had been preventing the party to convene its conference. The Provincial leadership was earlier dissolved following a decision by the High Court which nullified its 2015 elective conference. Now the province’s caretaker task team say there is finally an agreement. PTT Co-ordinator Sihle Zikalala says: “We believe that issues must be handled through the process of unity and within structures of the organisation. We have handled all issues, we are handling other issues that relate to regional conferences together with them and we believe that we’d be able to convene the conference in this coming week.” The disgruntled group of the ANC, which instituted the court proceedings, was locked in a meeting Saturday. Repeated attempts to get a comment from the group proved unsuccessful. ANC President Cyril Ramaphosa has been in and out of the province to try and find a solution to the impasse. Ramaphosa’s detractors have accused him of bowing to pressure while others have questioned whether he was in control. As the ANC heads to the national elections next year, the process to ensure that structures are in place is currently underway. The other big hurdle will be to ensure that the list process doesn’t further strain relations in provinces. Related video click below:
