Mining operations have ceased at the Palabora Mining Company in Limpopo. This is to enable an investigation of the death of six miners to proceed. The body of the sixth and last miner was recovered overnight. The miners were trapped underground, after a fire erupted in the early hours of Sunday. A team from various stakeholders was dispatched to Palabora Mining Company in Phalaborwa, Limpopo, to establish the cause of the underground incident that claimed the lives of six mineworkers. AMCU president, Joseph Mathunjwa, and NUM regional secretary, Philip Mankge, are also at the mine awaiting a report from the team. Mine spokesperson, Lydia Radebe says the mine suspended operations because it places emphasises on the importance of mine safety. NUM Philip Mankge says: “These mine incidents must stop now, we cannot everyday, every week, every month hear about the fatalities in the mining industry. I mean there are regulations in place that regulate the mine and then the issue of compliance needs to be taken very seriously by the mine bosses.” The families of the six miners and AMCU president, Joseph Mathunjwa were not available for comment. More than 15 mineworkers have been killed underground within two months at various mines in the country.
