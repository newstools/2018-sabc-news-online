Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) Leader Julius Malema says the party is founded on strong principles of socialism that will never lead to its collapse. With the celebration of its fifth anniversary, the party says it prides itself as being the voice to the voiceless and aims to hold the powerful accountable. With this, the third biggest political party in the country has faced its fair share in controversy and run-ins with the law. Malema has dismissed predictions from what he labels doom sayers who are adamant that there will be differences in the EFF which result in the party imploding. “There are new predictions that there will be differences in the EFF very soon and it will implode but we don’t see that happening because we are founded on the principles of socialism. We are not just an angry party; we’ve got ideas and a vision we want to attain and that is what drives us.” Meanwhile, Malema says one of the most important victories since their inception is the realisation of free higher education.
