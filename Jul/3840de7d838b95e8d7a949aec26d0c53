Young people have called on public representatives to respect and uphold the constitution.  They have expressed their views on a number of issues of public interest during the Youth Summit currently under way in Parliament. President of the Youth Parliament Sluleko Ndlovu has urged some of  the MPs who attended the youth summit to lead by example in respecting the Constitution. “Chapter 1 Section 2 of the Constitution clearly states that this Constitution is the supreme law of the Republic. Any law or conduct that is inconsistency with it is considered invalid. And the obligations imposed by it must be fulfilled. These obligations ladies and gentlemen referred to in the Constitution are what we call basic human rights. Now according to universal convention of the human rights, they are based on the belief that all human beings are equal and equal dignity and their rights.” More than 300 young people from across the country are gathered in Parliament for the Youth Summit to commemorate the centenary of former President Nelson Mandela and Albertina Sisulu. The summit is being hosted by parliament in partnership with the Nelson Mandela Children’s Fund under the theme “A Mandela in Every Generation.” Opening the event, Deputy Speaker Lechesa Tsenoli said the views expressed by the youth during the summit would enrich the work of Parliament. ‘”The views that you express will form an important foundation knowing we have heard you with support of other partners somewhere else so that we can be able to respond when we travel and tour that we are doing it together.” WATCH BELOW:
