The family of a 43-year-old man who allegedly hacked to death his three sons at Manyii village at Nzhelele in Limpopo, say they suspect he suffered temporary insanity before the killings. Samuel Madou allegedly killed his children aged two, six and seven on Saturday. His case has been postponed to the 17th of September to allow Madou to go for mental observation. Family spokesperson Dan Madou says Madou claimed that he was hearing voices before the killings occurred. Madou says: “We don’t know any differences as family between Sam and his wife since they have been together as husband and wife. I started to hear about this on Friday morning that he has a mental disorder because he insisted that there are people talking to him but other people could not hear those voices.”
