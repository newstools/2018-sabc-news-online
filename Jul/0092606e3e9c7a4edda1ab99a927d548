South Africans on social media reacted with shock to the news that former Gauteng health MEC, Qedani Mahlangu was elected to the party’s provincial leadership structures on Monday. Mahlangu was elected as part of the party’s executive committee in Gauteng. This came as a shock to many because Mahlangu could possibly be facing criminal charges for her role in the Esidimeni tragedy. At least 144 mentally ill patients died after being transferred to private NGOs under Mahlangu’s leadership. Brian Hlongwa, who was also accused of fraudulently redirecting government money to the ANC while he was health minister in Gauteng was also elected to the executive committee.    Many on social say this shows that the ANC is not serious about dealing with corruption. Below are reactions from twitter:
