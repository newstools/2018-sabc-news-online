The murder case of Sibusiso Tshabalala accused of fatally shooting his son Luyanda after he mistook him for a robber has been postponed in the Lenasia Magistrate’s Court south of Johannesburg. Tshabalala shot his son as he tried to get into the car after he returned from an evening class at Fred Norman Secondary school in Ennerdale, Johannesburg. Tshabalala says he fell asleep while waiting for Luyanda in the car. He opened fire after thinking he was being hijacked when his son tried to get in. Tshabalala is still out on a warning and is expected back again in court on September 4th. Magistrate Maggie van der Merwe says, “There are medical reports, forensic evidence, ballistic evidence, scene photographs, all these items usually take a bit longer. We’ll just have to wait patiently for the investigation to be completed and once all the evidence is available, then a proper decision can be taken in this matter. The matter is then postponed to 4 September 2018.”
