Power utility Eskom and unions are set to enter their fourth round of wage negotiations on Tuesday. Eskom upped its wage offer to 7% last Friday after unions turned down the earlier offer of 6.7%. The power utility previously offered a 6.2% increase for 2018 and 6% for 2019 and 2020 which trade unions National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) and Solidarity rejected. Eskom Spokesperson Khulu Phasiwe says: “We have upped the offer now to 7% and the gap with what Eskom is offering and what the unions’ demands of 9% is narrowing down. So we are hopeful that all parties are going into these wage negotiations to be influenced and this is why we are confident to getting closer and closer to resolving this impasse.” Phasiwe earlier lambasted unions for leaking information discussed in the negotiations.
