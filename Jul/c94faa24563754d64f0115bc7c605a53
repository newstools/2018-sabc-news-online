The SACP in KwaZulu-Natal has reiterated its call that Ingonyama Trust must be immediately scrapped. The trust headed by the King of AmaZulu Goodwill Zwelithini manages tribal land on behalf of rural communities in KwaZulu-Natal. Addressing the media in Durban, SACP’s Phumlani Mthembu says they believe that the land must be shared among those who work it. Mthembu says the SACP want the people to own the land and be given title deeds so they will decide on developing and rebuilding their lives independently. He says there should be a land restitution, distribution and security of tenure. “We stood firm on the SACP decision that Ingonyama Trust must be scrapped and be replaced by a more democratic communal land ownership pattern. This is because there are a number of reported cases of corruption and dissatisfaction among the people living on the land under Ingonyama Trust with permissions to occupy certificates with no security as they can be evicted unjustly in the name of Ingonyama. “The majority of the people who are supposed to be beneficiaries of the trust funds benefit very little if any on service from the funds of the Ingonyama Trust. We believe the King has the generosity to reason with the Ingonyama Trust Board and the Premier of KZN and heed to the plight of the land hungry people who want to work and live.” Watch videos below:
