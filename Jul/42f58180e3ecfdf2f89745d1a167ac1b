The Department of Basic Education says it is pleased with the content-rich submissions it’s been receiving on possible amendments to the draft National Policy on the Prevention and Management of Learner Pregnancy. Tuesday is the last day for accepting written submissions. The policy is aimed at ensuring that information about pregnancy prevention is made accessible to learners. Basic Education spokesperson Elijah Mhlanga says most of the suggestions give alternative ways of incorporating sex education in the curriculum. “We are delighted that members of the public are continuing to engage with us on this matter. Submissions have indeed come in. People are concerned about parental involvement in decisions that regard treatment or termination of pregnancy and consent of parents regarding certain information being given to children. Some organisations are also opposed to that but we are yet to read what their alternative suggestions are.” Mhlanga adds that they hope that the final policy will ensure that parents actively participate in safe sex education. “We hope the policy will help parents understand that they have a much bigger role to play than them allowing the department to tell them what to do with their lives and the lives of their children. They need to understand that they have a much bigger role to play in terms of influencing the children’s behaviour and for them to work together with educators in our schools.”
