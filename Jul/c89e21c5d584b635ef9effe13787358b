The State has asked the Bloemfontein Magistrate’s Court to postpone until next year EFF leader Julius Malema’s land invasion incitement case. Malema is accused of contravening the Riotous Assemblies Act when allegedly incited his supporters to invade land. The prosecution has submitted that the postponement would allow the High Court in Pretoria to finalise Malema’s challenge regarding the constitutionality of the Act. Malema’s lawyer Tumi Mokoena wants the matter to be struck off the roll, arguing that the magistrate’s court cannot make a ruling on the case which is still pending in the High Court. Malema is facing another land invasion incitement case in the New Castle Magistrate’s Court in KwaZulu-Natal and it is expected to resume in February next year. Watch related video below:
