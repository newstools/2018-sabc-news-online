The retail price of petrol will go up by one cent a litre from next Wednesday. The Department of Energy says illuminating paraffin will also cost four cents more. LP Gas users will be the hardest hit with a 17 cents price increase. However, the price of diesel is set to decrease by four-cents a liter. The department’s spokesperson Hein Barker attributes higher international oil price and a weaker rand to the US dollar to consecutive fuel price increases. “We are price takers in the world, we don’t produce our own oil. We need to import products in SA. And those products are quoted in US dollar per barrel,” says Barker.
