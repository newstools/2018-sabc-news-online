Poachers have killed two rhinos at the Shamwari private Game Reserve near Paterson in the Eastern Cape. The carcasses of the white rhino cow and her calf were found in the veld three days after they were killed and their horns removed. Just over a week ago, another rhino was killed and dehorned in the Kragga Kamma Game Park in Port Elizabeth. Head of security at Shamwari, Rodney Visser says the suspects might be linked to other attempted poaching incidents in the province lately. “We discovered the cow and calf shot and dehorned late yesterday afternoon. This brings the total amount of rhino to eleven for this year in the province. It is very sad. It was in a very remote area of the reserve. We haven’t lost a rhino since 2011. But yes we fell victim to poaching. We are looking into several leads that we are busy following up.”
