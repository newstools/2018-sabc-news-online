Most communities in the Vhembe area in Limpopo are still without clean running water. Many villages have not seen a drop of clean water since the dawn of democracy. In some areas people are forced to draw water from crocodile-infested rivers and dams. For the Makuleke community Day Zero has been a reality for a long time. Clean running water remains a dream. For decades they’ve been drawing water and washing in a crocodile and hippo-infested dam. A stone’s throw away in Magona village it’s no different. This community relies on ground water but this too is scarce. Boreholes are running dry leaving them stranded. A community member, Norman Mathebula says they often go days without water. The irony is that the villages are close to the filled to the brim Nandoni dam. The communities are part of the Vhembe district municipality that’s invested millions of rand with the VBS bank that’s been placed under curatorship. WATCH BELOW:
