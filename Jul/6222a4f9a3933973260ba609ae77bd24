Deputy President David Mabuza has hailed the launch of the MeerKat 64-antenna radio telescope as a great opportunity for the upcoming youth of South Africa. He officially launched the project at Carnarvon in the Northern Cape. Mabuza has emphasised that the project is in line with the National Development Plan which asserts that science, technology and innovation plays an important role in skills development, job creation and economic growth. “In mobilising our nation to respond to the emerging opportunities that are presented to humanity by the evolution of science and technology, our government has committed to transformative science technology and innovation.” “This commitment to science, technology and innovation takes into account the evolving debate, research output and inventions precipitated by the evolution of the 4th industrial revolution,” says Mabuza.
