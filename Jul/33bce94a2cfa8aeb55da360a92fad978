The African National Congress (ANC) Mduduzi Manana has resigned as member of Parliament. Manana made the announcement in a statement issued by his foundation. He was due to appear before Parliament’s sub-committee of the Ethics on Wednesday after he was found guilty of assault at a Cubana nightclub in Johannesburg last year. He was convicted on three counts of assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm in September last year after pleading guilty. In the statement, Manana says it would have been premature to resign while the other matter of his alleged assault of his domestic worker was being investigated. He claims he could now resign after the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) decided not to prosecute him on that matter. However, Parliament’s spokesperson Moloto Mothapo says they have not yet received a letter of resignation from Manana. Watch videos below:
