President Cyril Ramaphosa has returned to South Africa with R20-billion worth of commitments from Middle East countries. This follows another pledge by the United Arab Emirates to commit R10-billion towards investment in South Africa. The President concuded his three nations tour where he visited Nigeria, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Economic investment has been his top priority. Arriving in Abu Dhabi on his last visit of his three nation trip, after getting a ten billion dollar commitment from the Saudis, his focus shifted to the United Arab Emirates. There he met the crown prince, Sheik Mohamed bin Zayed and his message of more investment receiving a positive response. South Africans attended a business forum with their counterparts and the host nation said it’s ready to do business with South Africa. It may have been a whirlwind trip of three nations in four days, but the President feels he achieved what he set out to do. Ramaphosa was also able to nudge Nigeria towards signing a continental free trade area agreement. As much as economy was a priority, history too also featured prominently. He visited the Walkata Al Karama memorial that honours martyrs. He also had an opportunity to tour one of the biggest mosques in Abu Dhabi. The two countries have vowed to strengthen further relations between them. Click video below:
