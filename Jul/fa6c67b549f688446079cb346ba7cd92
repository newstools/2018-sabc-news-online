The inquiry into the 2015 collapse of the N1 Grayston pedestrian and cyclist structural bridge north of Johannesburg is set to resume in Pretoria on Monday morning. The inquiry is investigating the cause of the bridge collapse which killed two people and left 19 injured in 2015. Last week, legal teams expressed unhappiness about the Labour Department’s portrayal of the proceedings. Scaffolding company Formscaff and construction giants Murray and Roberts are some of the legal parties that accused the department of biased reports. This after the department issued a media statement that former Murray and Roberts employee Heine Pretorius has accepted responsibility for the collapse of the structure.
