The United Democratic Movement (UDM) says it will write to both the Speaker of the National Assembly Baleka Mbete and the Chairperson of the Public Enterprises Committee Zukiswa Rantho, to request them to issue summons for Duduzane Zuma to appear before Parliament on the allegations levelled against him and some of the Gupta family members. The party says if the son of former President Jacob Zuma is not forced to appear before Parliament, a dangerous precedent will be set for other people to undermine the institution in future. UDM Member of Parliament, Nqabayomzi Nkwankwa says all people should be treated equally. Nkwankwa says, “It is important before we conclude that ad hoc process that Duduzane Zuma is given an opportunity to come to account to Parliament for everything that we think he may have done wrong during the Gupta years.” “It is also important that we lump Duduzane Zuma together with Dudu Myeni because Dudu Myeni has been in the country for a while. Both of these people are in contempt of Parliament. This has serious implications because it means people can ignore Parliament even though are subpoenaed,” he adds. On Monday, Zuma appeared in the Specialised Commercial Crimes Court in Johannesburg on corruption charges and was released on bail of R 100 000.
