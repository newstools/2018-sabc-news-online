About eleven thousand polling stations across Zimbabwe are scheduled to open in an hour’s time for today’s historic elections. Zimbabweans will be voting without former president Robert Mugabe on the ballot paper for the first time since independence in 1980. President Emmerson Mnangagwa of the governing Zanu-PF faces MDC alliance leader Nelson Chamisa in what’s expected to be a tight contest. Residents of Bulawayo spoke to the SABC on the streets of the second largest city. “I just want my life to change by having a new president in this country and I believe the one that I vote for will win. Its my right as a citizen and I have to make sure that I am part of the situation. This time we think the atmosphere has been created we are going to vote I am very excited I am going to vote early in the morning though they may be other things but I will cast my vote,” says one of the resident.
