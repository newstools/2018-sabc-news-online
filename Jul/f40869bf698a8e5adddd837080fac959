The Home Affairs Department has deployed staff at Beitbridge border post in Musina ahead of Zimbabwe’s historic polls next week. Scores of Zimbabweans are expected to go home to vote in the presidential election. The department’s director responsible for ports of entry Stephen van Neel says: “We have deployed an additional 40 people that could assist with some services to be provided as we expect an increase of traveller movement. Infact, they already started this morning and they will be there until next week Thursday to make sure that the returning travellers are also taken care of.” He says law enforcement agencies have also set up a joint operational centre in Musina in preparation for any eventuality in Zimbabwe. “In terms of other deployments we know, we have set up a joint operational center in Musina that is to take and monitor elections in Zimbabwe and respond to any eventuality that may come our way,” adds van Neel.
