Former US President Barack Obama arrives in Kenya on Sunday for a one day visit. This is his first visit to Africa since he left office. While in Kenya, Obama will meet leading political leaders and later travel to the ancestral home of his father in K’Ogelo, Siaya County where he will be the chief guest at the opening of a social development centre built by his sister Dr. Auma Obama. A statement from the former President’s office indicates that he will meet President Uhuru Kenyatta and opposition leader Raila Odinga separately in Nairobi. He will then travel to Alego in Western Kenya, his late father’s ancestral home to inaugurate the Sauti Kuu Foundation a Sports, Resource and Vocational Training Centre. The centre is a brainchild of his older sister Dr. Auma Obama. It will provide educational, economic and cultural education to young people mainly drawn from the Western Kenya region in order to help them became self-dependent. Dr Auma Obama says the centre will serve as a safe physical space for children, youth and their families to meet, learn and interact freely.  From Nairobi, Obama will travel to South Africa where he is expected to deliver the annual Nelson Mandela lecture.
