ANC Youth League President Collen Maine says members of his organisation who will be volunteering for the ANC in campaigning for 2019 general elections, must humble themselves to the electorates. Maine was speaking during the league’s launching of the volunteer’s movement at Taung in the North West. Members of the ANC Youth League across the province assembled with the sole aim of ensuring that the ANC overwhelming wins the elections next year. However, they were also mindful of the fact that the party has some challenges, that include amongst others, disunity, factionalism and infighting, particularly in the North West. The matter was also confirmed, by their national leader, hence launching the campaign in the North West. ANC Youth League President Collen Maine says: “We decided that we must have the national launch here in the North West given the challenges that has besieged the party in this province.” “We thought it is important for us to make our contribution and you see that young people have responded in their numbers and are committed in ensuring that the ANC emerge victorious in all challenges that they are facing.” Maine encouraged members to humble themselves to the electorates. He says if needs be, they must also apologise for the wrong things the ANC did to the people. “As responsible members of the ANC we must appreciate that we have wronged people.” The national launch for volunteers will also be rolled out to other provinces in due course.
