Zimbabwe’s President Emmerson Mnangagwa  has shrugged off his predecessor, Robert Mugabe’s statement that he would rather vote for the opposition than vote for Mnangagwa. Mugabe, who was ousted in a military takeover last November, made world headlines with the statement on Sunday. Mnangagwa was asked for his reaction when he voted in the central town of Kwekwe on Monday morning. “In a democratic space in a country people have the freedom to express their views negative or positive.

Meanwhile, President Cyril Ramaphosa has wished the people of Zimbabwe well on their election day. President Ramaphosa is confident of a peaceful election. Watch full interview
