The Democratic Alliance (DA) in Kimberley says it’s ready for any court action which will seek to set aside the removal of Sol Plaatje Municipality mayor, Mangaliso Matika. Matika was removed after a vote of no confidence brought by the DA was passed in council Wednesday afternoon. The African National Congress (ANC) in the province has said it will seek court intervention to have it set aside. DA’s chief whip in the council, Christopher Phiri says, “In as far as them going to court, it’s well within their rights to go to court. But we are actually waiting for them to get there so that we can have clarity and closure to this. But we are confident that even if put before the court, all the circumstances that is before us, we are confident that we’ve got a victorious position in front of them.” The city was expected to shut down completely on Thursday. This as residents were set to march to the Sol Plaatje Municipality, demanding the resignation of Matika. Two weeks ago the protest turned violent with businesses and shops looted. Over 200 people have been arrested. A proposed electricity tariff hike of R260 caused the outrage. WATCH BELOW:
