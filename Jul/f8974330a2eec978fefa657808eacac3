Woolworths South Africa says its decision to recall its savory rice mix product is purely a precautionary measure on the global instruction of the Hungarian Food Safety Agency. The recall comes after one of Woolworths suppliers was identified as the likely source of a Listeria outbreak in Europe. This comes after global food supplier Greenyard recalled all frozen vegetable products made at its plant in Hungary “due to potential Listeria contamination”. The factory supplies sweet corn used in Woolworths’ rice mix. Over 200 people including 80 babies, died in South Africa since a Listeria outbreak was confirmed last year.
