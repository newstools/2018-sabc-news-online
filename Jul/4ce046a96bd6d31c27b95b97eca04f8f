The situation in Hermanus has worsened after a member of the Public Order Policing unit was assaulted with an axe to the head by a group of rioters in Zwelihle. Police spokesperson Andre Traut says the policeman was also robbed of his pistol and a shotgun. He has been admitted to hospital in a critical condition and was operated on Thursday night. The Western Cape Overstrand town has been a hotbed of violent unrest following the arrest of a prominent community leader more than a week ago. Gcobani Nzongana appeared in court on Thursday on charges of public violence and malicious damage to property. His case has been transferred to the Strand Magistrate’s court, where he will appear again on Friday. Traut says the police deployed to Zwelihle will remain on high alert in the area to maintain law and order. Meanwhile, Police Minister Bheki Cele will visit Hermanus on Friday afternoon. Cele’s expected to meet with the affected community at the sports grounds in Zwelihle.
