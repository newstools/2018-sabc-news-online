A 43-year-old man has been arrested for allegedly hacking his three children to death at Manyi village in Nzhelele in Limpopo. Police spokesperson Moatshe Ngoepe says the suspect allegedly hacked the children aged seven, six and two with a sharp instrument in the early hours of Saturday. Ngoepe says the incident is suspected to be related to domestic violence. “The SAPS provincial commissioner Lieutenant General Nneke Ledwaba is till reeling with shock and disbelief at the brutal manner in which three children were killed and has condemned the re-occurring incidents of domestic related killings and attacks which are still taking place in some areas in the province. In the most strongest term this condemnation follows the recent gruesome incident where a 43-year-old has hacked his three children to death. He is arrested and he will appear before the local magistrate’s court soon.”
