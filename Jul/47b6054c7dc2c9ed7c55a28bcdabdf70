The meeting that was supposed to be held between the FF Plus, AfriForum and King Mswati lll of the Kingdom of eSwatini over the land issue has been postponed indefinitely. eSwatini Prince Guduza of the Boarder Adjustment Committee says the meeting was requested by the South African organisations. He says it has been postponed due to the King’s other commitments. The FF Plus in Mpumalanga claim some land in the province belong to the Kingdom and they want to send a message to the South African government that no land will be taken from white people as they were given by the Swazi’s. The delegation was supposed to include AfriForum, Afrikanerbond and TAU SA. Prince Guduza says: “The meeting was under the request of some people in South Africa. I believed I would like to discuss something with the majesty which we are looking forward to hear from them what would be the gist of the discussion.”
