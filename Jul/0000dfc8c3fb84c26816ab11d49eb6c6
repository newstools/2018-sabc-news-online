Five more officials working at vehicle licensing centres on Gauteng’s East Rand have been arrested for alleged fraud and corruption relating to the illegal registration of vehicles. The officials including a supervisor were arrested at the Alberton and Bedfordview licensing offices. Last week, four officials working at the Benoni licensing department were also arrested for allegedly colluding with motorists to clear outstanding vehicle licence fees. Road Traffic Management Corporation’s Simon Zwane says: “The allegations against them is that they register vehicles in the names of deceased people and then re-register those same vehicles on the same day on the names of other people.” “That is costing the provincial government and Ekurhuleni losses running into millions of rands,” says Zwane.
