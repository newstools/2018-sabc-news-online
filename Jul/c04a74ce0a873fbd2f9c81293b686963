Efforts will be underway this weekend to strengthen the relations among Alliance partners the African National Congress (ANC), South African Communist Party (SACP), Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU) and the South African National Civic Organisations (SANCO). Amongst issues to be discussed at the Alliance Political Council on Sunday and Monday is the state of the Alliance and ways to deal with various issues facing the alliance and country ahead of the 2019 elections. The Alliance Political Council is the first to be convened since President Cyril Ramaphosa took office. Relations between the partners had suffered in the recent past following calls by the SACP and COSATU for former President Jacob Zuma to step down. The SACP also contested bi-elections elections alone in the Metsimaholo Municipality of the Free State in November last year much to the ANCâ€™s frustration. Now it seems fences are to be officially mended with issues such as the VAT increase, petrol price and issues facing the Health Department likely to be high on the agenda.
