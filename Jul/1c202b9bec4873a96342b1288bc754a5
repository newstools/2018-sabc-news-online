A memorial service for the slain Ivory Park Taxi association members is to be held at the Rabie Ridge hall north of Johannesburg on Thursday. Eleven people including taxi drivers, mechanics and their friends were shot and killed on Saturday last week. They were travelling in a taxi from a funeral of a taxi-boss in KwaZulu-Natal heading to Johannesburg when they were ambushed in Colenso on the R74. A twelfth victim died later in hospital. Deputy Chairperson of the Ivory Park Taxi Association Sam Sibisi says another person died in hospital on Wednesday night. However police spokesperson Jay Naicker says they have no such information. Police Minister Bheki Cele is expected to brief the media on Thursday. Sibisi says they are still baffled by the shooting. â€œWe are still surprised because even the taxi they were travelling in was not granted permission by the association to transport the deceased. Because when a taxi leaves for a funeral it has to be accompanied by an authorisation letter and be escorted by an association vehicle. That taxi was never granted permission for it to leave.
