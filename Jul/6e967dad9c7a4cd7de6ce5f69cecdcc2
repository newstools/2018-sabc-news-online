The Democratic Alliance (DA) in the Free State has complained to the Human Rights Commission over the water crisis in Kopanong Municipality. This follows Jagersfontein water crisis for years in the area. The DA led a service delivery march is to hand over a memorandum of demands to Kopanong Municipality. Residents traverse long distances to fetch water. The only hospital depends on jojo tanks. Residents have seemingly lost hope. The same municipality has failed to pay its workers their benefits. The DA says the municipality wanted to pocket the money when the mine wanted to assist. “They say that at that stage we were really prepared to assist the municipality but the problem was municipality wanted the mine to pay the money direct to their account not to Bloem Water,” says Free State DA leader Patricia Kopane. The municipality has refuted claims that they refused to financially assist.  “Those are lies, no one has come forward and we would appreciate anyone who wants to come on board for that. This just political scoring,” says Kopanong Municipal Manager, Martin Khubheka. The DA wants the municipality placed under administration. Kopanong municipality owes Bloem Water more than R250 million.
