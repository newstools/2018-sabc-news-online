Eleven people have reportedly been shot dead on the R74 between Colenso and Weeneen in the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands. It’s believed they were all taxi drivers who were apparently ambushed while returning from a funeral at Ematimotolo back to Johannesburg. The funeral is said to be that of taxi boss who was allegedly shot dead in Johannesburg last week. KZN police spokesperson, Brigadier Jay Naicker says, on the R74 road between Colenso and Weenen unknown persons jumped onto the road from the bushes and opened fire at the taxi. “Unconfirmed information for now indicates that passengers are from a taxi association in Gauteng attending the funeral of one of their members. Detectives from the SAPS Provincial Task Team in Durban were dispatched to the scene. There are multiple fatalities and detectives will only be in a position to confirm the numbers once the crime scene experts have combed the scene,” he said.
