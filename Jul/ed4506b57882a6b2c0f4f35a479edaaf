The ward councillor in Bonteheuwel on the Cape Flats, Angus McKenzie has called for the army to be deployed to the area. His calls comes after weeks of sporadic shooting incidents in which at least five people have been killed and several injured in the area. This is not the first time a call has been made for the army to be deployed to gang ridden areas of Cape Town. Government has however repeatedly not heeded to the call. McKenzie says innocent people have now become the target of what he describes as a gang war in the area. He says: “What has transpired over the last couple of days and weeks is that innocent people have become involved. It’s a situation of either being shot in the cross fire or being shot by gangsters directly.” “We are requesting the government to send the army in. It is clear that police have to fight crime but the army fights a war. We are dealing with a gang war at the moment. We are requesting that the army comes in to stabilise the situation,” adds McKenzie.
