One person has been killed and a number of others wounded in gang related shootings overnight on the Cape Flats in Cape Town. In the last two weeks, at least five people were killed during sporadic shooting incidents in the area. Ward councillor of Bonteheuwel on the Cape Flats in Cape Town, Angus McKenzie says the residents of the area are bearing the brunt of the on-going gang violence in the area. McKenzie adds, “We heard gun shots going off from about 11 o’clock all the way to about 4am this morning (Wednesday). In all of this, we have innocent people being affected. There is no control, gangsters have taken full control of the situation. They don’t fear the police. They are shooting at the police and they are carrying on at will to do what they are doing.”
