Gauteng taxi operators and bosses are living in fear and say they don’t know who’ll be killed next. They’ve appealed for calm following the gunning down of 12 Ivory Park Taxi Association drivers at the weekend. The minibus taxi they were travelling in from KwaZulu-Natal to Gauteng was ambushed on the R74 near Colenso. Eleven died on the scene and a 12th died later in hospital. Five others survived the attack. A memorial service for the deceased was held in Rabie Ridge, Johannesburg on Thursday. Under heavy guard Gauteng Taxi associations remembered their slain colleagues. One by one speakers took to the podium to call for calm and peace and from those who keep the wheels of the indiustry turning a plea for protection. A driver Justice Hlongwane says: “Please protect us. This industry cannot survive without us. No owner can drive 12 taxis alone.” It’s often said that the taxi industry is not for the feint hearted and recent events have shown just how volatile it is. A taxi owner Jabulani Ntshangase says: “We look on with fear. Our lives are under threat. People sit and decide who to kill. it’s terrifying we asking for prayers.” Umbrella taxi association Santaco has lashed out at the government. Santaco Technical adviser Rodney Rambuda says: “Where is our intelligence? 12 people were killed. Are we in a war?” Santaco President Philip Taaibosch visited the survivors of the ambush in hospital on Wednesday. Many of the slain drivers are expected to be buried at the weekend. Meanwhile, one person has been arrested for the taxi shooting.  WATCH RELATED VIDEO:
