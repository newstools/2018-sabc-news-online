Former African National Congress (ANC) employee Errol Velile Present and three co-accused who are implicated in three cash-in-transit heists, are expected to appear in Roodepoort Magistrateâ€™s Court on Tuesday. All four are charged with armed robbery and the possession of hijacked motor vehicles and are expected to apply for bail when they appear. The suspects were found in possession of four hijacked vehicles, two of which were apparently used in a heist outside a Capitec Bank branch in Dobsonville, Soweto at the beginning of this July. Following their arrests, Present was also linked to two other cash heists in the North West, he has since been dismissed from the ANC, due to the serious nature of the allegations against him.
