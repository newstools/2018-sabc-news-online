Political Analyst from the University of Johannesburg, Mcebisi Ndletyana says the ANC’s Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal elective conferences needed to give more chances to women to lead. The two provinces held their elective conferences – which saw the election of one woman in Gauteng – Deputy Secretary General, Nomantu Nkomo-Ralehoko, while in KZN, Nomusa Dube-Ncube is the Treasurer of the ANC in the province. Ndletyana says gender parity should be representational in organisations such as the ANC. “The foundations of the Republic on Gender representation should be presented on public organizations and life. There shouldn’t be any exceptions. Be it in government or SABC because we use public life to infuse our values into people’s minds. So what they see is what socialises them.”  Dissatisfaction ANC NEC member, deployed into Gauteng, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma has expressed dissatisfaction on the lack of women representation in the party’s leadership in Gauteng and KwaZulu Natal. Dlamini-Zuma was speaking during a Media conference held in Johannesburg, where the top five leadership was being officially introduced. She says the struggle for women empowerment will continue until the society changes for the better. “We are fighting for a non-racial non-sexist but we cannot say we have achieved the non-sexist society that we are aspiring to. So the struggle continues – so we can’t say we are happy with one woman in the top 5 – we are not happy, but the struggle continues. But we are happy that without any adjustments we were able to have at least 18 women in the PEC.”
