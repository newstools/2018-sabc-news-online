Parliament’s Portfolio Committee on Transport is expected to begin conducting country wide public hearings on the new Road Accident Benefit Scheme (RABS) Bill. The bill seeks to facilitate the move from a lump sum pay-out, to more specific claims that can provide prolonged assistance if necessary. The committee chairperson Dikeledi Makatsi says it will promptly help with compensation for road accident victims and their families. Makatsi says, “The Road Accident Benefit Scheme just got the social security aspects which actually did not appear in the current act. Issues of social security if you look at road accident fund once you’re involved in a road accident you get a once off payment but with this bill you get some funding including going into social security aspects. They will be able to regulate how you are going to get that money but the other thing they’ll make sure that you’ll still be getting the money in the case of disability. With the proposals we are getting there should be funding on an annual basis.”
