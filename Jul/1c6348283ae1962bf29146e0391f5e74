Water restrictions and reduced production by farmers in the Eastern Cape are likely to continue for the rest of the year, due to the prolonged drought in the province. Some farmers say this is the worst drought in a century. It is affecting citrus producers and vegetable, sheep, angora goat and cattle farmers. Garth Sampson from the weather office in Port Elizabeth says heavy rains are expected only towards the end of the year. “Over the long term the seasonal forecast for July shows a little bit of promise of rain, but that falls flat again in the following month and right through November. The catchment area looks like the models are predicting with confidence a below average rainfall.” Meanwhile, the towns like Elliot and Queenstown had one of the wettest first six months of the year.
