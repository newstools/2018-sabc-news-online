Acting African National Congress (ANC) Gauteng Chairperson David Makhura says e-tolling continues to be a great source of frustration and will be discussed at the party’s provincial conference in the Tshwane Metro this weekend. The matter has been referred to President Cyril Ramaphosa for review. The provincial ANC has conceded that the matter was among the issues that cost them votes in Gauteng in the 2016 elections. Makhura says although they’ve previously spoken against the e-tolling system, the matter will again have to be discussed. A number of other policy issues including the state of economy and fuel hikes are also expected to be discussed at the conference. WATCH RELATED VIDEO:
