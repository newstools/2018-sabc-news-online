Yet another group of disgruntled African National Congress members are expected to make an urgent court application to interdict a conference on Friday. This time it is the Ruth Mompati region in North West. The members want to stop a regional conference planned to start on Saturday in Christiana. They say legitimate delegates, from various branches, have been left out, and those aligned to former Premier Supra Mahumapelo are invited as delegates. Spokesperson for the disgruntled members, Walter Mabogola explains, “There is no formal communication in terms of the conference because according to the ANC procedures, processes, constitution and policies prior to a conference there must be a meeting of a regional structure which involves the PEC deployees. It is that meeting that will discuss issues around logistics of the conference procedures and so forth. After which formal invitation letter must be cascaded to all the branches through the branch secretaries that has never happened so far.” Meanwhile, ANC Secretary General Ace Magashule has emphasised the importance of unity among party members in KwaZulu-Natal. He was addressing delegates attending the party provincial conference underway at the Durban University of Technology Thursday night. Magashule says a united ANC in KwaZulu-Natal is a major contributing factor to the party’s performance in elections nationally. He says, “Know that KZN contributes in the national politics in terms of Parliament. You contribute 22 percent as KZN only. Now if KZN is not going to be united, if you can’t still see that the enemy is amongst you, if you are going to think that it is about me and nothing else, you KZN you shall have betrayed the revolution.”
