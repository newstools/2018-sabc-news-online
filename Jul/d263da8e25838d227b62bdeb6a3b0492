The Democratic Alliance’s (DA) Federal Council is meeting this weekend in preparations of the 2019 national elections. The party has been dogged by differences of opinion on diversity and Cape Town Mayor Patricia de Lille, but maintains none of these issues will derail its campaign. The DA Federal Council is highest decision-making body between congresses. The meeting comes at a time when the party is putting out fires on several fronts. Some analysts predict that the internal wrangling may lead to a loss of support. Top of the agenda of this meeting is the 2019 poll. “The agenda has four main issues, economic offer going to elections, composition of legal commission of the party and candidate’s selection, the process and the composition of selection panels,” says DA national spokesperson Solly Malatsi. The party held its elective congress earlier this year. However issues including Cape Town Mayor Patricia de Lille and opinions of leaders on equality continue to highlight differences in the DA. “ That issue hasn’t come up and its unlikely to come up because we are focused on moving the party forward towards elections. There is a realisation that diversity is an important pillar of the organization and everything we do must live up to all our pillars including diversity,” says Malatsi. On the land issue, the DA maintains its position that all South Africans should have title deeds for the land they live on. The party also wants stricter border control but free and legal trade. The Federal Council meeting ends on Sunday. Click below for more on the story:
