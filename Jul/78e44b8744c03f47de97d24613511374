Former Deputy Chief Justice Dikgang Moseneke has expressed optimism as he takes over the task of helping Lesotho to find peace. Moseneke has recently been appointed by President Cyril Ramaphosa to lead a mediation team to resolve the political situation in Lesotho. Ramaphosa was appointed by Southern African Development Community (SADC) heads of state as a Facilitator in Lesotho following the country’s security and political challenges dating back to 2014. Moseneke says he will be visiting the Mountain Kingdom next week Friday. “I’m humbled by the appointment. I’m making no promises at this stage. But we have to find peace, stability, proper governance and hopefully, constitutional changes that Basotho themselves would like to see happening. The first assignment is a courtesy call on Friday to see the King; to see the Prime Minister; alternatively the Deputy Prime Minister; governance structures; civil society. SADC representatives who are there present, and a small military presence and its leadership there.”
