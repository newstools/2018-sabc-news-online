Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs Minister Zweli Mkhize is expected to meet the Pro-Makhado Task Team in Thohoyandou on Wednesday over Limpopo’s on-going municipal border dispute in Vuwani. Some residents of Vuwani and surrounding villages have been protesting for years against the Municipal Demarcation Board’s decision to include their area into the Collins Chabane Municipality. The municipality was formed in 2016 and includes parts of Makhado and Thulamela municipalities. Two years ago, about thirty schools were set alight in the Vuwani, Masakona and Mashau areas. Former President Jacob Zuma suggested then that the affected areas temporarily receive basic services from the Vhembe District Municipality. Residents however claim they are not getting any service from the district. File video of the protest action that occurred:
