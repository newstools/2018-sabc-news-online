The Department of Education has distanced itself from a Whatsapp message claiming that schools will re-open on the July 19 instead of July 17. The message claiming to be from the office of the Presidency says the change in dates is due to Mandela day celebrations. “We would like to inform you about the school re-opening changes. We have shifted it to the 19th due to Mandela Day. And there will be lot of things happening,” reads the message. Elijah Mhlanga from the Department of Education says the message is a hoax. We can confirm that the message is fake and must be ignored and deleted as it has caused much confusion in the basic education sector,” says Mhlanga. He says the message was created to cause confusion and anxiety and is not from the Presidency. “Our schools went on recess on 22 June and will resume 17 July 2018 as per the school calendar approved two years ago. We expect all our learners and educators alike to report duty on as scheduled in order to commence the third term without any further delays,” says Mhlanga. He says Mandela Day celebrations will not disrupt schooling and in fact social media message is contrary to what Nelson Mandela and Albertina Sisulu (whose legacy is also being celebrated this year) stood for as they were committed to ensuring that all young people in South Africa access education without disturbance.
