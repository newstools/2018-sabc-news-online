Metrorail says the estimated cost of the damage to the train which burnt on Saturday is around R10 million. A train travelling to Soweto caught fire at the Crown train station, south of Johannesburg. No one was injured in the incident. Metrorail suspects an act of arson. Spokesperson Lillian Mofokeng has appealed to commuters to report those who vandalised the trains. She says: “Unfortunately, we have lost two plain trailers and one motor coach to the estimated value of R10 million. We appeal to commuters and communities outside to actually help us as metrorail to name and shame the people that are vandalising our assets.”
