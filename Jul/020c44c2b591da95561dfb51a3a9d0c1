North West Premier Job Mokgoro says good progress has been made in solving problems affecting the Health Department since the deployment of an administrator. The department has been placed under administration. Irregular expenditure including flouting tender regulations were some of the challenges identified. Members of the SANDF were also deployed to various hospitals to assist when health workers left their positions during the strike that led to violent protests. Premier Mokgoro says it will take time to resuscitate the situation. He says: “The last time which is fairly recent when we got a progress report, I think we were gratified that the administrator and team are really driving the department in the right direction.” “The challenges are quite huge. We will not have instant solutions but the process that the administrator has started has very exciting promises and is moving in the right direction,” he adds.
