The South Gauteng High Court has found that former International Relations Minister Maite Nkoana-Mashabane’s decision to grant former Zimbabwean first lady Grace Mugabe diplomatic immunity was inconsistent with the Constitution and should be set aside. At the time, Mugabe was accused of assaulting model Gabriella Engels at a hotel in Johannesburg. The Democratic Alliance (DA) and AfriForum asked the court to set aside the government’s decision, on grounds that it was illegal and unconstitutional. DA believes that Mugabe was granted immunity simply to shield her from being tried in a court of law for her assault on Engels and two others on 13 August 2017. It says condoning such behaviour, as the granting of immunity did, cannot possibly be in the interests of South Africa. Judge Bashier Vally delivered the judgment.
