Many Zimbabweans have continued to express their dissatisfaction with how the current economy is being run. There is almost no money circulating in the country, forcing customers to wait in long queues just to access their funds. A retail worker in Zimbabwe says they rely on the black market just to stay in business. “Its quite difficult because when we get the Eco cash out there, we are going to get the US so that we can restock again so it’s been quite hectic and the percentages have been something else. We are getting our money from the black market that is where the problem is. We have certain percentages that we are using here so if I want $100 sometimes I pay someone 175 to get $100 so it’s been very very difficult.” The leader of the Alliance for the People’s Agenda Dr Nkosana Moyo says the people have lost trust in the government. “There is no shortage of money in Zimbabwe; there is money just in the wrong places. There’s been flight of money from the former system, if you go to a place called Roodepoort you can get all the rands you want, you can get all the dollars you want you can get all the bond notes you want. People do not trust the system, they don’t trust who is running the country. They don’t trust the financial systems because they are in collusion with the government. We put our monies in the banks, it disappeared and they never explained to us where it went. So people are of course keeping their money under the mattress, so the issue is an issue of trust how do we restore trust. It’s going to take time,” says Moyo. Zimbabweans now also rely on a new innovate way to transact amongst each other, without using physical currencies such as Eco-Cash.
