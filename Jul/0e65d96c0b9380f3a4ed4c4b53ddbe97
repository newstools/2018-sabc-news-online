Residents of Galeshewe, outside Kimberley, say there is no going back anymore as the shutdown of the town continues and roads remain closed. Earlier on Monday the residents burnt tyres and barricaded roads. They are pleading with the Kimberley High Court to rule in favour of councillors when it takes a decision on the application to have Sol Plaatje Mayor Mangaliso Matika removed from office on Tuesday. African National Congress (ANC) councillors last week supported a Democratic Alliance led motion of no confidence against the Mayor. Matika however says the meeting was not valid and has refused to vacate office. At least 75 schools have been closed due to the province. Residents maintain their demands are not politically motivated and have called on parents to keep their children at home. “For the interest of the community, for the safety of the community, for the safety of the kids and for the livelihoods of Sol Plaatje residents, the high court decision must be that Matika must step down,” says one of the residents. “Matika must just step down so that peace can be restored,” says another resident.
