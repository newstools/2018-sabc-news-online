President Cyril Ramaphosa has strongly rejected the proposal by some European leaders that detention centres be constructed in North African states to counter the massive influx of refugees into Europe. It’s estimated that approximately one million people arrived by boat in Europe, 75% of whom came from countries such as Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq. French President Emmanuel Macron has been leading efforts to convince leaders of countries like Libya, Niger, and Chad to allow the setting up of processing facilities to detain and turn back those trying to flee into Europe. The move has been criticised by human rights organisations, who have argued that such facilities could lead to arbitrary detentions and expose refugees to inhumane treatment and torture. President Ramaphosa says: “Let me say on this notion of creating bases – it’s akin to creating prisons for the people of our continent and I can’t see how African leaders can accede to that.  So, let the people move freely. As more developed economies, let them invest in African economies so that there is broad based economic development.”
