Community leaders in Kimberley have decided that a march calling for the resignation of Sol Plaatjie mayor Mangaliso Matika will continue on Thursday. The protest was supposed to happen on Wednesday. Violent protests erupted two weeks ago following a march against a proposed high tariff increase. The Municipal manager and the Chief financial Officer of the municipality have been placed on precautionary suspension. At a meeting between community leaders, police and traffic officials, an agreement was made for businesses, schools and roads to be opened. Community leader Tumelo Masikare says the mayor must go. He says: “I’m dissapointed that we are standing here today not wanting the mayor. The people do not want him, he has failed us.” Related videos:
