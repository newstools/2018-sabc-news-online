A case against thirteen Marikana men believed to be the kingpins in the spate of killings in Marikana last year has been postponed to the 30th of August by the Brits Magistrate’s Court. Nkosinathi Mantashe, and 11 others were arrested between October last year and March this year. They have been charged with conspiracy to commit murders and attempted murder. Police Commissioner General Khehla Sitole has called their arrest a breakthrough in unsolved continued killings in the Platinum belt. Only 12 out of 13 accused appeared in court on Wednesday, and a warrant of arrest has been issued against accused number 13, Siyanda Sinqine. However none of them has been charged with murder on this case. They have been charged with conspiring to commit several murders, including the attempted murder of AMCU branch chairperson, Malibongwe Mdazo – who was shot sixteen times. The state says investigations have been completed, and the case has been referred to the Director of Public Prosecution, to decide on whether to prosecute.
