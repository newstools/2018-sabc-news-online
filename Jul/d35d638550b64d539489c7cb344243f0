Motorists are warned of two separate protests affecting traffic on the N12 highway in the Lenasia area as well as Protea South in Soweto. Traffic has been affected on both directions of the N12. It’s not yet clear what the demonstration is about. In Protea South some residents have blocked off a bridge because they don’t have electricity. Johannesburg Metro Police spokesperson Wayne Minnaar says: “There are protests on the N12 near the Sasol filling stations and Impala road.” He says motorists are advised to drive with caution as more officers are being sent to that location. “There are also protests in Protea South, Lenasia link and Chris Hani road. The road is completely blocked off so motorists cannot use the bridge between Chris Hani and and the N12. Motorists will have to use alternative routes for now,” says Minnaar.
