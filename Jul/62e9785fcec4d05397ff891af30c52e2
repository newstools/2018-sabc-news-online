Service delivery protests have caused disruptions at Bushbuckridge, in Mpumalanga. Residents of Oakley in Marite, went on the rampage blockading roads, demanding clean drinking water. Water is a scarce commodity in the area, residents are forced to share it with livestock. They are now up in arms, calling on authorities to intervene. “It’s been four months or more since we have had water here. We are sharing water with cows, and it’s filthy. We had tap but they are dry. We have to go to neighbouring villages to get water and it’s far,” says a resident, David Shabangu. The residents want clean drinking water among other things. The beleaguered Bushbuckridge Municipality acknowledged the water challenges and promised to intervene. But until then, the residents will be forced to travel kilometres to neighbouring villages to access clean drinking water. Or continue to share it with livestock.
