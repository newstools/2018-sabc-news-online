The Telecommunications and Postal Services Minister Siyabonga Cwele says his Social Development counterpart Susan Shabangu has been left without an option but to take the Cash Paymaster Services (CPS) to court. Cwele says CPS has kept the grants recipients in the dark about the switch from them to the South Africa Post Office (SAPO). The South African Social Security Agency (SASSA) and the Post Office plan to migrate all beneficiaries who are currently receiving their grants in cash at the CPS paypoints by the end of next month. Cwele says, “They claim that these are normal bank charges, but because they were part of the CPS process, they should have informed the beneficiaries and the Minister of Social Development – but all those things were not done… that’s why the Minister is taking them to court. We are still encouraging people to move from that green card to the new gold card, to avoid these illegal things.” Watch related videos below:
