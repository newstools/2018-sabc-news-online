A 29-year-old suspect in the murder of 25-year-old ANC official Bongani Mkhize is expected in court soon after handing himself over to KwaZulu-Natal police. Mkhize was ANC Deputy Chairperson for Ward 88 in Umlazi, south of Durban. Mkhize was returning from the KZN ANC Provincial Elective Conference at the Durban University of Technology. Police spokesperson Jay Naicker says the two men were seen arguing before the suspect shot Mkhize. He says: “The two men were seen arguing at V-section in Umlazi when the man then shot Mkhize.” “A 25 year old man was shot and a 29 year old suspect handed himself over to the police. The firearm that was used in the shooting incident has also been seized by the police. The suspect will be charged for murder as well as for possession of an unlicensed firearm and is expected to appear in court soon,” says Naicker.
