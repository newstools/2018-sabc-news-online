The Economic Freedom Fighter (EFF) is gearing up for the 2019 national and provincial elections. It is holding a three-day elections workshop in Johannesburg with members from across the country, seeking to provide clear guidelines on how the elections will be handled. EFF deputy president Floyd Shivambu says their main focus is to consult the masses on what they would like to see transpire on the people’s manifesto for the elections. “These are third elections that we are participating in as an organisation and we have learnt great lessons from the previous elections, in terms of how do we best communicate with our people, in terms of when do we start; how do we cover the ground; how do we get to respond to the concerns of the people. “So, the people that are here represent all the regions and provinces. So, they’re going to give the best in terms of their own experiences, in terms of, how best do we come with a clear elections program which is going to lead us to victory in 2019,” says Shivambu.
