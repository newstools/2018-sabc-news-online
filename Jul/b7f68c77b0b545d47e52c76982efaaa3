The website of the Presidency is up and running again after it was hacked earlier on Saturday. It was then temporarily disabled. The presidency confirmed that no information had been compromised.  An investigation has been launched but the identities of the hackers remain a mystery. Presidency spokesperson Khusela Diko says no information has been compromised following the hacking incident. Diko says there is no need for panic as the information on the website was freely available to the public. “Our technicians are currently investigating. We hope to have it restored to operation very soon and only then will we be able to get a better sense of who is involved. What the motive behind it could have been,” says Diko. Meanwhile, President Cyril Ramaphosa will only make a decision regarding suspended SARS Commissioner Tom Moyane‘s request after the start of Moyane’s disciplinary hearing to be led by Advocate Azhar Bham. Yesterday the President met the deadline to respond to Moyane’s legal team that had requested him to to stop or disband the investigation into the Revenue Service. Moyane had earlier requested the chair of the SARS Inquiry, retired Judge Robert Nugent to suspend the investigation, pending the end of his disciplinary process. The commission is investigating tax governance and administration issues at SARS and will reconvene in August. Moyane wrote to the President saying that it was unfair that he was facing two inquiries that probe the same thing. Presidency spokesperson, Khusela Diko says, “In essence Mr Moyane is arguing what he believes is unfairness of the process of the disciplinary process as well as the commission of inquiry into SARS. So the President has said that he understands that Advocate Bham has scheduled a hearing where the same matter will be heard before Advocate Bham. And the Presidency would like to get the benefit of Advocate Bham’s views on the matter before any decision is made on that regard,” says Diko. WATCH BELOW:
