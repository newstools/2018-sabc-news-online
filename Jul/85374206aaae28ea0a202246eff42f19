Former Democratic Alliance (DA) Member of Parliament Lindiwe Mazibuko has called for an active citizenry to take up the matter of electoral reform even to the Constitutional Court. Mazibuko addressed the Cape Town Press Club on various issues. Mazibuko was the youngest leader of opposition and also the first black woman in this position in 2011. Fast forward a few years after her public break up with former DA leader Helen Zille and her abroad studies at Harvard, Mazibuko has set up an A-political academy aimed at identifying and mentoring young potential leaders in public office. She says more young people should be in leadership roles in political parties and government. However the only way to bring about meaningful change is for the citizens themselves to take the issue of electoral reform to the Constitutional Court. She says her academy will work with any civil society group that takes up the case in the Constitutional Court. It is for this academy that Mazibuko is going around to look for opportunities of mentoring, not looking for a new political home. Asked to give her opinion on the effect of the Patricia de Lille saga on the DA, Mazibuko did not mince her words. “I would like to know what she actually did?”
