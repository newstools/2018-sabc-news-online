The Democratic Alliance says the African National Congress should pay back the money it received from entities that had an alleged corrupt relationship with Brian Hlongwa. It says it is going to lay charges against the ANC and the ANC Women’s League. The DA says this happened while Hlongwa was Gauteng Health MEC between 2006 and 2009. The DA’s Jack Bloom says this is likely a contravention of the Prevention of Organised Crime Act. “We have got the evidence from an anti-corruption task team report has been before court. The amount is more than R800 000  and was given to the ANC by entities that had dealings with the  Gauteng Health Department that appeared to be corrupt. And we think that the ANC should pay back the money. This money should be returned to the Gauteng Health Department so that it can be used to fix our hospitals and clinics.”
