Telkom and the South African Post Office workers are still on strike following negotiations that hit a deadlock. Workers are demanding a 12 % salary increase while Telkom is offering workers 3% and the Post Office 6%. Negotiations started earlier this year before the matter went to the CCMA where unions were granted a certificate to embark on industrial action. Communication Workers Union’s Aubrey Tshabalala explains, “We are going to the CCMA today so that we can be able to try to find each other. And on the side of Telkom we obvisously gave them 72 hours to respond. We anticipate that we will get our responce at the end of the day today. As far as we are concerned our industrial action goes on. There is an attempt to interdict us by the South African Post Office last night. So we are going to respond to that interdict this morning”
