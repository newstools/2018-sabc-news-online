Women’s Month will kick off with widespread marches across the country to protest against gender-based violence. Protests organised under the hashtag “Total Shutdown” want women to stay away from work and school for one day. Demonstrators will, among others, demand stronger sentencing in gender-based violent crimes. Crimes against women to be included in school curricular and strengthening the presence of social workers at school. The ANC’s Women’s League has asked women to call-out the men who have abused women. The league’s young women’s desk posted the names of men, some of whom are members of the ruling party, who were found guilty of violence against women on their Facebook page. Women’s Month begins on Wednesday, and it commemorates the women who marched to the Union buildings in August 1956 against apartheid-era Pass laws.
