The South African National AIDS Council (Sanac) has challenged South African men to play are more proactive role in fighting HIV/AIDS in the country. Part of the findings of the South African HIV Prevalence, Incidence, Behaviour and Communication Survey showed that men were falling far behind women in testing for HIV, taking treatment and having the virus suppressed in their bodies. It has also shown that men contribute to the high number of HIV infections in young girls and women through the sugar daddy and blesser phenomena. Sanac’s Steve Letsike says, “We have women leading the response but we have men in strategic positions. Where are the men? Why are they not playing their role? Many of the politicians are men, many of faith leaders are men, many of traditional leaders are men, we can’t be complacent, why are we not responding, why are they not testing? Why are they not taking treatment? Whose responsibility is that?”
