Gautrain commuters may be forced to find alternative means of transport as workers threaten to go on strike. Workers affiliated with the United National Transport Union have warned that they will down tools if their wage demands are not met. This comes as wage negotiations between the Bombela Concession Company, the operator of the Gautrain, and the union came to a deadlock. Bombela has tabled an 8.5% wage increase while workers are demanding 10%. The company has been given a 48 hour deadline to respond. The union’s General Secretary, Steve Harris says: “Our constituents have indicated that they are ready, able and willing to continue with the strike action if the company does not meet their demands. We are far apart from each other. The strike will commence on Monday morning.”
