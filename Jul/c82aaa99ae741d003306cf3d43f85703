The SABC is to undertake a second round of public consultations as part of the review of its 2004 Editorial Policy. The consultations will take place between the 23rd and 31st of July. SABC spokesperson Kaizer Kganyago says submissions from the first round of consultations have been collated into a draft policy and submitted to the SABC board for comment. He says the draft policy is now available on the SABC website. “We are now going to go on a roadshow to all the provinces again to make sure that people comment, but also we’re going to make sure that we encourage people to go onto our website and check these documents so that they can then comment before we make a final document that will be sent to ICASA.” Kganyago says submissions from the first round of consultations have been collated into a draft policy and submitted to the SABC board for comment.
