Many have gathered at Westonaria Civic Centre in the west of Gauteng for the first land hearings on whether Section 25 of the Constitution should be amended. This is the first of such meetings in Gauteng and parliamentary Constitutional Review committee chair, Vincent Smith has asked the people here to exercise tolerance. “You are here to talk to parliament. The rules of parliament apply. Tell us what your view is and be tolerant towards someone with a different views.”  As the proceedings continue inside, a demonstration is taking place outside. Artist and Activist, Masello Montana, says the process followed at these hearings is incorrect. She says staring at 1913 concerning the land matter is wrong, “there were incidents of dispossession before 1913, why aren’t incidents from that period taken into consideration?” she asks. Her protest is of an artistic nature. She is backed by three headless figures whom she says represent three decapitated kings, Hintsa, Bambatha and Jantjies.   Meanwhile, inside members of the public dressed in their different political regalia are raising their view on the question of the day. It is evident that the Democratic Alliance and Economic Freedom Fighters are the most represented here. Vincent’s call of tolerance is somehow ignored as a white Afrikaans speaking young man says “Die land was nice he steel nie (the land was not stolen). He says the EFF must stop lying to the people about land. Another woman, is also hackles after she says “black people are lazy, they don’t deserve land.”    Smith intervenes and asks the public to not insult each other but focus on the matter at hand. The hearings will continue until 16h00. They will move to Vereeniging on  and Pretoria on Saturday.
