The DA has begun its marathon interviews for premiers of the nine provinces ahead of the 2019 national elections. So far 31 candidates have been lined up to appear before the 18 member-panel at the party’s Bruma Offices, east of Johannesburg. The hotly contested provinces of Gauteng and the Western Cape have three and two candidates respectively. Speaking to the SABC, Chairperson of the DA Federal Council James Selfe says they are using strict criteria for the choice of their premier candidate. “They have to obviously show leadership characteristics. They have to be visionaries, and they have to inspire people with hope. But they also have to be rooted in the values for which the DA stands of opportunity, fairness, freedom and diversity. But they also have to able to do the job and it’s a very complicated job, a highly technical job and we would like them to  be competent to that,” says James Selfe.
