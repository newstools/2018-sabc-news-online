Security expert Jasmine Opperman from the Terrorism Research and Analysis Consortium says it is too soon to speculate on who could be behind the spate of suspicious devices found in shopping malls and public places in Durban. Five devices have been found since last week, three of which were placed at Woolworths branches in shopping malls. Two Woolworths clothing stores in Durban were partly burnt after explosives went off. The affected stores are at the Gateway Shopping Complex east of the city and at the Pavilion Mall in the north. There were no injuries. Opperman says this is cause for serious concern. ”We have people now willing to make use of such devices in public areas which could easily lead to the death or collateral damage of innocent civilians being killed. That is the fundamental issue at stake here, a person or group of people with no respect for innocent civilians willing to make use of violence to achieve a specific goal.”
