Scores of residents of the Bojanala region in the North-West are on Thursday expected to make submissions on the land question at the Rustenburg Civic Centre. Hundreds of people made their submissions in Taung and Mahikeng in the past two days in which robust debates were held. A Parliamentary Committee is overseeing the hearings. Traditional leaders of the Barolong clan said the amendment of the constitution should go ahead as it was long overdue. The Democratic Alliance (DA) remains opposed to the call for amendment to Section 25 of the constitution to allow for expropriation without compensation. DA Parliamentarian Carrin Visser says this would have a negative impact on the economy. Visser says: “We are earning a lot of money through exporting agricultural produce so that will also stop. We will have a negative impact on big farmers, the farmers that are really feeding our nation.” Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) Parliamentarian Mathapelo Sewisa on the other hand says there’s no need to panic about food security as South Africans will be able to produce their own food. She says: “Poverty is going up and unemployment is going up. If we get the land back, we will be able to say that now we can produce more as South Africa, which means there will be more employment.” The KwaZulu Natal leg of the hearings will move to Jozini on Thursday after being held in Vryheid on Wednesday.
