The Zimbabwe Election Support Network (ZESN) says the few female candidates who stood for elections have been subjected to hate speech on social media during the election process. The ZESN is an independent body that observes all aspects of the electoral process in Zimbabwe. It was briefing the media on its observations. Chairperson of the ZESN Andrew Makoni says the country’s Electoral Act needs to be reviewed, so it allows participation of more female candidates. “The Electoral Act is silent on the matter of women  being equally represented in political spheres. 90% of the candidates for the major contesting parties namely Zanu-PF and the MDC respectively are male.” “There was hate language on social media especially targetting female candidates and officials and perhaps it is one of the issues that resulted in a very insignificant number of women candidates in this election.” Related video click below:
