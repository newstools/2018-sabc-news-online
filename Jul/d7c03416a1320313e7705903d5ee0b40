The City of Cape Town has started its R57 million housing project. The 340 unit Belhar project is scheduled for completion in two years’ time. Mayoral Committee Member for Urban Development, Brett Herron, says the project will include amenities and play areas for children. “I visited the site with several local Councillors and assisted in the building as part of our 67 minute Mandela Day initiative to commemorate Tata Madiba’s centenary birthday celebrations. The project entails the building of semi-detached and free-standing single storey houses, as well as the installation of electrical infrastructure, street lighting and sidewalks.”
