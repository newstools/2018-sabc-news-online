Social Security Agency (Sassa) has warned grant beneficiaries who have the new gold card that it can’t be used at cash pay points for at least two months. The social grant agency however says the cards can be used at ATM’s, Post Offices and merchant stores. Earlier system glitches affected 700 000 out of the 12 million beneficiaries with the new gold card. Sassa spokesperson Paseka Letsatsi says they’re ready for the August payments. Letsatsi says, “The Sassa together with the South African Post Office have worked 24 hours around the clock to make sure the system is up and running. We know there were system glitches in the past month but we can safely say we are confident from where we are that payment of social grants will go without any problems this time around.”
