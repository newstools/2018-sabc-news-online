Former President Jacob Zumas son, Duduzane Zuma has handed himself over to the Johannesburg central police station. This is ahead of his appearance at the Specialised Commercial Crime Court in Johannesburg. It’s understood that Zuma is currently being charged with corruption, allegedly for his role where former deputy finance minister Mcebisi Jonas claims there was an attempt to bribe him at the Guptas’ Saxonwold home in 2015. Jonas alleged in a sworn affidavit to former public protector Thuli Madonsela that he was offered a bribe of R600 million. Accompanied by his legal team, Duduzane arrived at the Johannesburg central police station just after 7am. Duduzane looked relaxed as he shook hands with the media at the police station. It’s understood that Zuma is being charged with contravening the Prevention and Combating of Corrupt Activities Act. The former president’s son returned to South Africa on Thursday when he was detained for several hours at the OR Tambo international airport and questioned by the Hawks. Earlier this month, Zuma also received a summons to appear in the Randburg Magistrate’s Court on the 12th of July on two charges of culpable homicide. Duduzane  is being transported by police to the Johannesburg Specialised Crimes Court. Watch related videos below
