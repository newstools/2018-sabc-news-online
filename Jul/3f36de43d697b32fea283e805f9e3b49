Gautrain operator, Bombela Concession Company has assured commuters that they will be safe when travelling using the Gautrain service. This, after reports of alleged intimidation against non-striking workers led to police presence at various Gautrain depots. Gauteng Roads and Transport MEC, Ismail Vadi has also condemned acts of intimidation. Workers affiliated to the United National Transport Union (UNTU) went on strike this morning demanding among other things a 10% wage increase while Bombela is offering 8.5%. Gautrain spokesperson, Kesagee Nayager says they have implemented additional security measures. “We have implemented additional security measures and the safety of passengers and workers will not be compromised at any time. We have taken the necessary legal steps to ensure that the UNTU members protest peacefully and within the ambits of the law,” says Nayager.
