Nine people have been arrested on the N3 Highway in the vicinity of Pietermaritzburg in the KwaZulu-Natal midlands following a protest by residents and truck drivers against the petrol increase. KwaZulu-Natal MEC for Community Safety, Liaison and Transport Mxolisi Kaunda says the highway has been opened to traffic. Kaunda says police will not tolerate those who are breaking the law. He says they arrested nine drivers including one female driver. He says the message is clear: “This country has got laws and the laws do not allow people to just do as they want, blocking roads and shutting down the economy of the province.” “This government is going to act decisively against those who are causing anarchy in the country. There are laws in place and people will be brought to book,” adds MEC Kaunda.
