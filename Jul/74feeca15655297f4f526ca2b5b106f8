Initiatives to honour Nelson Mandela’s legacy ahead of his centenary are continuing around the country. At Madiba’s birthplace of Mvezo in the Eastern Cape, a machine to produce sanitary pads will be put in production on Tuesday. The machine which will be the first of its kind in rural South Africa, is able to produce 2500 pads per day. Chief of Mvezo and Madiba’s grandson Nkosi Mandla Mandela says a number of famous women will attend the event. A delegation led by Julia Molley, the founder of beauty with a purpose as well as the current Miss World will be in Mvezo along with three former Miss Worlds. Mandla Mandela said, “They are coming with Ankari innovation, which is an Indian based company that is donating a machine that is worth US$50k to produce sanitary towels. We will be empowering local women in the community to be able to produce these sanitary towels for the young girls at school.” WATCH RELATED VIDEO BELOW:
