The Northern Cape Education Department has appealed to protesters not to stop pupils from attending schools when they re-open on Tuesday. This comes amid an on-going electricity hike protest in Kimberley as the Sol Plaatje municipality is trying to resolve protests that have seen looting and the arrest of scores of people since last week. The education department released a statement advising parents, pupils and teachers to use their discretion and assess whether it’s safe to go to school. Department spokesperson, Geoffrey Van Der Merwe says, “At this stage we are at risk of losing valuable learning and teaching time if an amicable solution is not reached. We are appealing to the public to ensure that schooling commences as normal. “We are entering a crucial term especially for our matriculants as they are preparing for their final examinations, adds Der Merwe.
