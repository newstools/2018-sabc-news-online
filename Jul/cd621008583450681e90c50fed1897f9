Pinetown ward councillor Melanie Brauteseth has called on KwaZulu-Natal police to investigate attacks on construction firms around the Ethekwini Metro. This comes after the latest incident in which seven construction vehicles, mainly trucks, were torched in Pinetown near Durban on Tuesday night. The owners of the vehicles say there is an ongoing feud in the construction industry and that they have been several attacks of this kind recently. They’ve called for government intervention. Brauteseth visited the site of the latest attack on Wednesday. “Unfortunately this is not an isolated situation, it’s an issue all over eThekwini where construction has been affected by different association. We request a full investigation with the SAPS to give us feedback on how they are going to deal and what they will be doing in terms of this investigation.”
