Port Elizabeth police have arrested three members of the same family as suspects in the murder of an elderly electrician this week. Detectives and Hawks members arrested a mother, daughter and son at a house in Kabega Park on Saturday in connection with the death of 70-year-old Petrus Scholtz. His body was discovered by a pedestrian near Fairview outside the city on Thursday with gashes on his head. His hands and feet had been tied together with a nylon cord. Scholtz’s vehicle and tools were recovered. The three suspects will appear in the Port Elizabeth Magistrates’ Court on Monday.
