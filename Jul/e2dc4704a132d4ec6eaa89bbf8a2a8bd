Police Minister, Bheki Cele has arrived in Kimberley to urgently intervene in the impasse between the community and the Sol Plaatje Municipality. Community members are protesting and have barricaded roads in Galeshewe calling for the ousted Sol Plaatje Mayor, Mangaliso Matika to leave office. Cele is expected to first meet with Premier Sylvia Lucas who has been mum about the issue. Some schools around Kimberley instructed parents to keep their children at home, fearing violent altercations. Meanwhile, the Kimberley High Court is yet to hear the urgent application filed by the Democratic Alliance to force Matika to vacate office. There are still sporadic clashes between police and protestors in Galeshewe.
