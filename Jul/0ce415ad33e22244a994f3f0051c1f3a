ANC Youth League president Collen Maine has appealed to members of the party who will be volunteering to campaign for the party for next year’s general elections, to humble themselves to the electorate. He was speaking during the league’s launch of the Volunteers’ movement in Taung in the North West. “As responsible members of the ANC, we must appreciate that we have wronged people and as we do door to door raise issues… for instance we pronounce that certain projects will be delivered at a particular financial year, and such projects would not have been delivered at this point in time, and that promise would have been made four years back… As responsible ANC people we are to our people, we appreciate that this commitment was made and has never been fulfilled – it is not how the ANC should do things.” Maine explains why they decided to launch the campaign in the North West. “…given the challenges that has besieged the party in this province of the North West, we deemed it important for us to make our contribution… and you see that young people have responded in their numbers and are committed in ensuring that the ANC emerge victorious in all  challenges that they are facing.”
