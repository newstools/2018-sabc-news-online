United Nations (UN) experts will step in on Monday to help the North West with its turnaround strategy. The objective of the UN agencies is to assist in the process of ensuring that the Section 100 interventions lead to a sound and sustainable provincial administration, before the end of the 5th administration’s term next year. Spokesperson in the office of the premier Vuyisile Ngesi says Premier Job Mokgoro is expected to welcome the UN technical team in the province. Ngesi says UN agencies with experience and expertise are to assist the provincial government to recover following Cabinet’s resolve to invoke Section 100 1 a and b of the Constitution in the province. “To assist the province in the areas of administrations focusing primarily on agriculture and health and also to assist with departments with planning, monitoring and evaluation on areas that have been identified as the reason for section 100. It’s a Marshall Plan approach in a sense that we leave nothing out. Basically, United Nations is mobilising all its resources to come and assist us,” says Ngesi. WATCH RELATED VIDEO:
