It’s not clear yet whether government will take any action over Zimbabwe’s former first lady Grace Mugabe after a court removed her diplomatic immunity on Monday. The Democratic Alliance (DA) and lobby group AfriForum brought the case before the court. The high court in Johannesburg ruled that the 2017 decision by then Minister of International Relations, Maite Nkoana-Mashabane to grant Mugabe diplomatic immunity was unconstitutional. Mugabe was accused of assaulting a model Gabriella Engels and two others at a Johannesburg hotel in August last year. The Department of International Relations says it will study the judgment before deciding on its next course of action. The judgment by Bashier Vally is most likely to bring diplomatic ties between Pretoria and Harare under spotlight. It’s been suggested that the department may appeal the judgment, while lobby group Afriforum has warned that it may seek private prosecution of Mugabe. Related Video:
