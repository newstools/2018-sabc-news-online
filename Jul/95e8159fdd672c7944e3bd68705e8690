Four Metro officials have been arrested at the Germiston Licensing Department, in the east of Johannesburg, over fraud and corruption. A total of 13 officials have now been arrested. They’re accused of registering vehicles in the names of deceased people as a means to clear fines. They would then re-register the cleared vehicles under the names of the rightful owners. The first four suspects who were arrested last week are due at the Johannesburg Specialised Court on Monday. Road Traffic Management Corporation’s Simon Zwane says the scam has been costly. “This scam is estimated to be costing the municipality provincial authorities and even the RTMC about R18 million in lost revenue. We believe that they do take bribes as a result of manipulating the system in favour of the motorists who are owing monies on license fees and penalties that have not been paid,” says Zwane.
