Congress of SA Trade Union (Cosatu) in the Western Cape says it will hold a night vigil outside Parliament on Thursday to protest against the recent 1% VAT increase. Value added tax went up to 15% on the 1st of April. The organisation’s new office bearers in the province say they will address a number of issues affecting people’s lives, including the continuing fuel hikes and the increases in the prices of food and electricity. Cosatu’s new provincial secretary, Malvern de Bruyn, says there is a total assault on workers in the Western Cape . “Poorest of the poor are the onse that will be harmed the most and in terms of that we are saying as Cosatu we will have a night vigil on the 12 of July outside of parliament. We want to show government we are serious and we can’t allow VAT increase to continue. ” Parliament says National Assembly Speaker Baleka Mbete has to consider various factors before responding or granting IFP MP Mkhuleko Hlengwa’s request for an urgent debate on the effects of the fuel hikes. Hlengwa has written to the Speaker week ago requesting her to resume the House urgently for such a debate. FOR MORE WATCH VIDEO BELOW:
