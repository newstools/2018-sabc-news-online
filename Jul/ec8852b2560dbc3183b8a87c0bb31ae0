Chairperson of Parliament’s Police Committee, Francois Beukman, says a request to investigate the alleged unethical conduct of Independent Police Investigative Directorate (IPID) head, Robert McBride, will be treated as a priority. The request was made by Police Minister Bheki Cele. The Speaker of the National Assembly has referred the letter to the Police Committee. Parliament is currently on a two-month constituency period. Beukman says they will discuss the matter as soon as committees reconvene in mid-August. “In the case of IPID, of course it makes provision where there are complaints with regards to the ED, that that matter will be referred to a parliamentary committee for referral and consideration. Of course, this matter will be part of our agenda for discussion and consideration.”
