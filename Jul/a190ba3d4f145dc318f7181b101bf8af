Political analyst, Ralph Mathekga says the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) is contradicting its earlier stance on the land issue through its plans to form an alliance with traditional leaders body, Contralesa, ahead of next year’s elections. During a press briefing on Thursday the party defended comments by the King of AmaZulu, Goodwill Zwelithini, calling on his people to stand up and defend their land. Public hearings on land expropriation without compensation continue around the country. Both the EFF and Contralesa pledged their support for amendments to Section 25 of the Constitution, to allow for expropriation of land without compensation. Mathekga says the EFF is capitalising on the current rift between the ANC and Contralesa regarding the land issue. “If you go back, you realise that the EFF had actually taken a position that had said that the land actually belonging to the King will also be affected by expropriation of land without compensation… and I think they are being mindful of the fact that Contralesa’s relationship with the ANC seems to be fraught, and Contralesa is being seen as quite a powerful force going into elections because it is seen as connecting point with larger constituencies… and now what we are seeing is that the EFF’s position on this, it’s not based on the principals. I wonder if they will still maintain the same position after the elections,” says Mathekga.  Watch related video below:
