Another Metrorail train has caught alight at Retreat train station on the Cape Peninsula. Fourteen firefighters and two fire engines of Cape Town fire services are on the scene. The cause of the fire is unknown at this stage. The fire comes barely a week after seven train coaches were torched at the Cape Town station at the weekend causing an estimated damage of R30 million. It’s the sixth incident this year. Metrorail spokesperson, Riana Scott says: “We have just received confirmation of another train on fire at the Retreat train station. Our teams are on site and according to first reports our employees are busy separating the burning train from the rest of the carriages to contain the damage.” He says currently they have no further information but will issue a statement as soon as they do.
