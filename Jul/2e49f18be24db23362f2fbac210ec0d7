The African National Congress Women’s League has condemned what it calls racist attacks on former National Prosecuting Authority deputy head Nomgcobo Jiba by the General Council of the Bar (GCB) and Freedom Under Law. In a statement the League says it has observed a well-orchestrated racist campaign launched by these NGOs against Jiba, working with the media and the NPA. The League says Freedom Under Law also instituted the disciplinary inquiry against Jiba as retaliation for the prosecutions that she had instituted against certain white people. Jiba was recently in the news when the Supreme Court of Appeal overturned an earlier High Court judgment in favour of the General Bar Council’s claim that she was unfit to hold office.
