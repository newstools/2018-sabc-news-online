The Verulam Family Court north of Durban has denied bail to a 43-year-old man accused of rapingÂ his 10-year-old step daughter. He is facing a string of charges including rape, sexual grooming of children, sexual assault, display of child pornography to children and assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm. When denying him bail, Magistrate Irfaan Khalis said it will be difficult to trace the accused if he decides to abscond the trial as he does not have an identity document, permanent employment or fixed assets. Khalis says his release on bail was going to disturb public peace. The case has been postponed to 23 August for further investigation. Watch the video below for related news:
