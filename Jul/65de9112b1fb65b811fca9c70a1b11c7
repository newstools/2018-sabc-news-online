Police Minister Bheki Cele has welcomed the arrest of African National Congress (ANC) employee Errol Velile Present for alleged involvement in a cash-in-transit heist in Dobsonville, Soweto, earlier this month. The ANC has since dismissed the employee who worked at the party’s headquarters Luthuli House in Johannesburg. Present and three co-accused were arrested on July 7 and 8 and have already appeared in the Roodepoort Magistrate’s Court. “The full might of the law will be felt and exercised at all times, no matter who you are, who you know or where you work, we are coming for you. An arrest of this nature is a sign of our commitment to ensuring all South Africans feel safe.  It is our responsibility to uphold and enforce the law, create a safe and secure environment for all,” says Police department spokesperson Reneilwe Serero.
