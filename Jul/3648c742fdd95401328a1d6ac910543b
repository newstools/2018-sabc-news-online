South Africa is to host the 10th BRICS summit at the Sandton Convention Centre this week. The BRICS countries will engage on matters relating to building programmes around social and economic development and promoting human rights. The meeting is meant for the countries from the different regions. South Africa, the host, will push for an African agenda. It is for that reason that other African countries have been invited with development and prosperity to be at the centre of the discussions. Itâ€™s an important milestone in building stronger solidarity and cooperation among emerging markets. South African Development Community (SADC) objectives are informed by its common agenda which seeks to advance peace and sustainable development in the region, a role which BRICS can enhance. Taking the BRICS theme into consideration, its leaders will have time to interact with African leaders on how best they can bring about inclusive growth and share prosperity. BRICS also aims to reach out to fellow developing and emerging markets, among them, Turkey which has shown a great deal of interest in the continent. South Africa also wants BRICS to look at establishing a working group on peacekeeping. Some civil society organisations are expected to protest during this summit citing human rights violations by some of the invited heads of state. Click video below:
