Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba says his department is ready to introduce its programme of modernisation of ID documents application and birth, marriage and death certificate registrations. Briefing the media in Pretoria about the live capture system upgrade, Gigaba says the home affairs offices will be ready to move into paperless process by the end of this month. He says the shift into new technology is an attempt by government to eradicate corruption and it will be more convenient for people applying for those services at home affairs office. “From the moment you apply for your ID card to the moment your ID card is printed or your passport, there is no human intervention whatsoever. The process is fully automated even how your ID card is dispatched from the printing machine into the white envelop from which you receive it when you come to collect it there is no human being who touches it. So the same will apply with the birth certificate. “The human intervention which was involved here which would have enabled some people to even register children that are not theirs so that they can obtain child’s support grants; all of that is going to be shut down by this system.”
