The Youth Employment Service (YES) has been granted a go ahead by South African Revenue Services to be a Public Beneficiary organisation. YES is an initiative that seeks to find employment for young people, “giving them a chance at a life-changing first work experience with a unique collaboration between governments, labour, civil society and the youth.” CEO of the organisation, Dr Tashmia Ismail-Saville says, “We need to give young people exposure and better choices, so that they can see a range of opportunities that are out there for them.” Ismail-Saville says they want to build economic opportunities that are closer to where young people live. “We are focusing deeply on Small, Medium and Micro-sized Enterprises (SMMEs), because growth comes from SMMEs,  not from big companies,” says Ismail-Saville. The initiative was launched earlier this year in March. Click link for full interview
