North West University professor Theo Venter says he is in support of the re-configuration of the cabinet size which critics say became bloated in the former President Jacob Zumaâ€™s era. Venter says he agrees with the announcement by President Cyril Ramaphosa that it was important to cut the size of the government to foster more efficient use of public funds. Prof Venter says there are currently 35 cabinet ministers and no less than 37 deputy ministers. He says the running of the cabinet is estimated to cost up to R720 million per year. He says if cabinet can be trimmed down, it can possibly bring the number of ministers down to below 30. WATCH RELATED VIDEO:
