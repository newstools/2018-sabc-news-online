Students at the University of Cape Town have praised the work of the late Dean of Health Sciences Professor Bongani Mayosi. Mayosi died last Friday following a two year battle with depression. He was awarded the country’s highest honour, the Order of Mapungubwe in 2009. Students have described his death as a great loss. One of the students says: “Going into the memorial service I didn’t really know much and I was just coming to pay my respects. But coming out of that I certainly felt sadness and I think that it was a good service because you came out wanting to know him.” WATCH RELATED VIDEO BELOW:
