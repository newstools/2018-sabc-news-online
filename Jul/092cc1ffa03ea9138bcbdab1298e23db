One illegal miner was killed, one wounded and two arrested during a shoot-out with police at Lily mine near Barberton in Mpumalanga. A manhunt for more illegal miners is underway. On high alert combing the area for clues, illegal miners allegedly shot at police on Sunday night. A shoot-out  resulted to an illegal miner being fatally wounded. Mpumalanga Police Spokesperson Leornad Hlathi says: “Four guns were recovered, they are the ones that started shooting and police responded, our operations are underway to ensure that we arrest other suspects” A shortage of jobs appears to be the reason for the illegal mining. An illegal miner says the closure of the mine worsened the situation. Over 2 000 workers lost their employment when Lily Mine stopped operating in 2016. This was after the mine ground caved in, trapping three staffers who were working in a lamp room container. The community living on the outskirts were dependant on the mine for employment. South Africa loses billions of rand each year due to illegal mining. Some mining companies in Mpumalanga are spending about R1.5 million per month on security. Police have urged community members to play their part in curbing illegal mining.  Click video below:
