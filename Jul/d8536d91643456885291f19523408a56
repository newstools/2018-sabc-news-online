Social Development Minister Susan Shabangu says progress has been made in changing the South Africa Social Security Agency (Sassa) cards, as the South African Post Office has now taken over the grant payment service. The Constitutional Court gave Sassa until September this year, to finalise the roll out of new cards. The South African Post Office has taken over from the controversial Cash Paymaster Service following the court order. Minister Shabangu visited Sassa service points in Jouberton Township, Klerksdorp in North West. “We are making good progress, by yesterday (Friday) from the 2.5 million which was getting their money in cash we are now at 1.8 million. So when I see this it makes me very excited because it means we are on track, and our people understand the need for them to change the cards to the new system of government is offering to them.” Click below for more on the story:
