Sibusiso Tshabalala , who shot dead his son Luyanda at Fred Norman Secondary School in Ennerdale, south of Johannesburg last month, is expected to appear again in the Lenasia Magistrate’s Court on Tuesday. He was released on a warning when he made his first court appearance last month. Tshabalala told the court that he accidentally shot his teenage son upon his return from an evening class. He says he had fallen asleep while waiting for the Grade 11 learner in the car and thought he was being hijacked when Luyanda tried to get into the car. The suspect faces a charge of murder. During his bail application last month, an emotional Sibusiso Tshabalala told the court through his lawyer that it was after he had fired the fatal shot that he realised that it was his son, and not a hijacker as he had thought. He says he then rushed the teenager to the Lenasia Clinic where the nurses tried to save him, but it was too late. Tshabalala pleaded with the court to release him on bail so that he could bury his son in dignity. Magistrate Maggie van der Merwe obliged and released him on a warning saying he had submitted a plausible version. The state did not oppose bail on the basis that it did not deem him a flight risk. The matter was postponed to Tuesday for further investigation. Watch for more:
