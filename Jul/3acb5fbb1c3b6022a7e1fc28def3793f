Thirteen men accused of last year’s killings at Marikana in the platinum belt are to appear in the Brits magistrate’s court on Wednesday. They are charged with murdering at least 10 Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (Amcu) leaders in Marikana between March and September last year. They are also facing multiple attempted murder charges. A special police task team arrested them around Marikana and Idutywa in the Eastern Cape. Nine of the accused are on bail, while four believed to be the ring leaders are in custody. Scores of Marikana residents including mineworkers have filled the court gallery.
