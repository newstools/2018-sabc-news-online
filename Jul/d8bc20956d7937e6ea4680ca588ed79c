The man accused of the murder of his girlfriend’s three-year-old son is expected to undergo re-examination in the High Court in Johannesburg on Tuesday. Timothy Naidoo is in custody while his long-time girlfriend Mary is out on bail. Their names have been changed in this story as per court order. They have both pleaded not guilty to charges of murder, abuse and neglect after the three-year-old Daniel died after allegedly been submerged in boiling water. According to the expert testimony of Dr Candice Hansmeyer who conducted the autopsy, Daniel succumbed to blunt force trauma to the head. His injuries dated back to early 2016 and included a broken femur, broken elbow, several bruises, injuries to his ribs and 60% burn wounds on his body. Hansmeyer  said Daniel’s injuries indicate that his feet were held in the boiling water. During her cross-examination on Monday, Mary said her boyfriend had sent her a text message saying that he had killed Daniel and she did nothing. This was the first time the court heard this information. Mary’s cross-examination ended on Monday after six days on the stand.
