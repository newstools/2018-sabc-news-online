Eskom says it may resort to load-shedding after several incidents of intimidation and sabotage at some of its power stations. The power utility believes that the incidents are aimed at forcing the power utility to accede to the demands of the unions. The main sticking point appears to be unions demanding bonuses. Eskom says it’s currently working closely with the police to secure its infrastructure. Eskom’s spokesperson Khulu Phasiwe says the latest incidents have put pressure on the system. “The current industrial action has negatively impacted plant operations at several power stations,” says Phasiwe. He says while the risk of load shedding remains high during this period,Eskom has activated all its emergency structures and they are also urgently engaging union leaders to resolve this impasse. “Because of this illegal action we are not in a position to guarantee that light will be kept on, there is a high risk of load-shedding. It may not happen today it may happen tomorrow because of intimidation that we are seeing. We are urging all union leaders to come to meeting with Eskom so that they can speak to their members…they are saying they are not aware that their members on an illegal strike,” says Phasiwe. He says customers are advised to plan on the assumption that load-shedding will take place and are encouraged to check their load-shedding schedules on the Eskom and their municipal website. — Khulu Phasiwe (@KhuluPhasiwe) July 30, 2018
