Western Cape Minister of Transport, Donald Grant, has called on the public to help authorities in their investigations into the spate of suspected arson attacks on Metrorail trains. In the latest incident, five coaches were left gutted at the Retreat Station in the South Peninsula. Last week seven coaches were set alight at the Cape Town Station. Grant joined Transport Minister, Blaze Ndzimande, at the Paarden Island train depot to inspect the gutted coaches. He says the public needs to play their part. “The biggest area that has been affected is the Central Line. It used to have 33 trains running and we have got eight at the moment on that line. It’s a question of we need to get out into the communities. “I think we need to show them what the future looks like but the communities must also understand we need their partnerships as commuters to help us identify people who are hell bent on destroying the opportunities which are created by rail which is the backbone of the public transport sector.” WATCH RELATED VIDEO BELOW:
