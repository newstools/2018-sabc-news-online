The African Union (AU) and the United Nations (UN) say they fully support the recent agreement between South Sudan’s warring parties to form a unity government. The two institutions say that the agreement can be perfected with time, what is important now is peace in South Sudan. South Sudan was one of the countries whose status was discussed at the second AU/UN annual conference held in Ethiopia. In their recent round of talks South Sudan President Salva Kiir and opposition leader Riek Machar have agreed to a ceasefire and to work together. The two agree that there will be four vice presidents and opposition leader Machar be the first. The UN says that with the worsening humanitarian crisis in South Sudan, any peace deal that can end the war is a good deal: Antonio Guterres UN secretary General says: “When I saw that there is a chance of peace I immediately believed that all of us need to do everything possible to make that chance become a reality. The details of the transitional agreement might not be perfect; I think that is totally secondary if peace is indeed achieved.” With the new agreement there will be additional members to government to accommodate the other warring parties in the conflict. The terms of the latest deal by the South Sudan warring parties is similar to one that was reached in 2015 but never held. The African Union agrees that the agreement is not perfect but says it is workable for now. South Sudan continues to reel from the effect of internal conflict that began in 2013 and has since displaced over 1 million people internally and those seeking refuge in neighbouring Sudan, Uganda and Ethiopia. The AU and the UN say they will not hesitate to take punitive measures against spoilers of peace in South Sudan should the warring factions fail to uphold the new peace  deal they have agreed on.
