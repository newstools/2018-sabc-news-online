Eskom is expected to table its revised offer on Tuesday afternoon. This is after all unions rejected the power utility’s last wage increase of 7%. Power utility Eskom and unions have entered their fourth round of wage negotiations on Tuesday. On Friday, Eskom upped its wage offer to seven percent. This after unions turned down the earlier offer of 6.7%. Eskom has made it clear that it wants a three-year wage deal. However, the company wants unions’ demands for bonuses to be deferred. “Eskom management indicated that they are willing to increase their offer of 7% and also put something on housing allowance, but when it comes to bonuses they are waiting for audited financial statements to be signed off…. so we are waiting for Eskom to present its latest offer,” says National Union of Mineworkers’ spokesperson Livhuwani Mmamburu. Eskom spokesperson Khulu Phasiwe says, “We have upped the offer now to 7% and the gap with what Eskom is offering and what the unions are demanding which is 9%. It is narrowing down. So we are hopeful that all parties are going into these wage negotiations to be influenced and this is why we are confident to getting closer and closer to resolving this impasse.”  Eskom and unions have entered their fourth round of wage negotiations…
