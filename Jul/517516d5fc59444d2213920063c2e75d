The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) marked its fifth birthday in the Eastern Cape on Thursday by lending a helping hand to the less fortunate. The party’s leadership donated electronic wheelchairs and laundry equipment to the Vukuhambe Special School in Mdantsane. This past week, the EFF has been drumming up support for its birthday rally to be held on Saturday. The EFF was born when its two founding members – Julius Malema and Floyd Shivambu – were expelled from the African National Congress Youth League (ANCYL). The EFF is the third biggest party in parliament with 25 seats, and plans to increase its footprint in the political arena. The donation to the Vukuhambe School formed part of the EFF’s drive to make a meaningful difference to the less fortunate. A birthday rally will be held in the Sisa Dukashe stadium on Saturday.
