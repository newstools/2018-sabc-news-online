The Social Justice Coalition (SJC) says it does not think that deploying the army to crime-ridden areas in the Western Cape is the answer. It says the crime problem will persist as long as all spheres of government do not prioritise the safety of their people. There have been calls by provincial authorities for the SANDF to be deployed to various areas including the Cape Flats. However, Police Minister Bheki Cele has turned down the request. SJC general secretary, Axolile Notywala says no government striving for justice and equality would deploy the army in townships. He says: “Crime and violence in the Western Cape has always been high and we saying that the army is not going to resolve these issues. All levels of government need to work together to resolve some of the issues.” “All what is needed is the redistribution of the police,” he adds. He says police need to be removed from areas where crime is not too bad to areas where they are seriously needed.
