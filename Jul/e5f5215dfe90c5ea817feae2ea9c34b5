The State Capture inquiry has been extended by nearly two years. This will be backdated from March 2018. The Commission will therefore conclude its work by or before March 2020. It’s headed by Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo. The inquiry will focus on how government SOE’s and departments had been manoeuvred by private entities to strip the State of billions of rands. Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo sought an extension last week. The court granted the request on Monday, subject to confirmation on October 2. Former President Jacob Zuma established the commission in March. This followed a High Court ruling which ordered him to comply with the Public Protector’s remedial action. Zondo’s office says one of their challenges was that it was never indicated on which date the 180-day time period had to be calculated from. The time-frame was given by the former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela. This meant that there was no certainty as to when it would expire. Zondo brought the application last week but without notifying anyone due to its urgency. President Cyril Ramaphosa, the Public Protector and several political parties can oppose the finalisation of the order on October the 2nd. The interim order extends the 180-day deadline by a further 24 months, calculated from 1 March 2018. Related video click below:
