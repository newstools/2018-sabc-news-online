Police say a suspect arrested for a different crime has been linked to the Colenso taxi shooting incident in KwaZulu-Natal on Saturday last week. A taxi transporting 17 people from a funeral of a taxi boss in KwaZulu-Natal was ambushed on the R74 while heading to Johannesburg. Twelve people including members of the Ivory Park Taxi Association in Johannesburg and their friends were killed. National police spokesperson Vishnu Naidoo says: “I can confirm that we do have a suspect in custody on another matter and I can also confirm that we are very confident that this suspect is also linked to the massacre we are investigating but he hasn’t been charged with that as yet.” Meanwhile, Gauteng taxi operators and bosses are living in fear and say they don’t know who’ll be killed next. They appealed for calm during the memorial service for the deceased held in Rabie Ridge, Johannesburg on Thursday. Under heavy guard, Gauteng taxi associations remembered their slain colleagues. One by one, speakers took to the podium to call for calm and peace and from those who keep the wheels of the industry turning – a plea for protection. Related video
