The Competition Commission’s Health market inquiry has revealing some distressing findings in the private healthcare sector. These include lack of competition, the rising cost of the medical aid cover and disempowered consumers. The Commission released its findings in Johannesburg on Thursday. It initiated the inquiry after suspecting that some features of the sector stifled competition with over-servicing doctor who made hasty decisions on hospital admissions. Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi says his Department is vindicated. “The report is just confirming exactly what we have been complaining about – that the costs are exorbitant. Remember that during the hearings, there were two presentations from the World Health Organisation and the Organisation for Economic, Co-operation and Development which said only ten percent of South Africa’s population can afford private health care.” Watch related video below:
