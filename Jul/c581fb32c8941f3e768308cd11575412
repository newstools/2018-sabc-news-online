The High Court in Pretoria has granted with costs an urgent interdict application to United Democratic Movement (UDM) leader Bantu Holomisa. The order prevents Holomisa from making allegations about corrupt dealings between the Public Investment Corporation (PIC) and a number of Investment firms and fund managers. Lebashe Investment, Harith General Partners, Fund Managers and former deputy finance minister Jabu Moleketi are among the applicants who took Holomisa to court after he wrote an open letter to President Cyril Ramaphosa implicating them in alleged looting at the PIC. In his letter to Ramaphosa, Holomisa called for the scope of the State Capture investigation to be widened to include alleged corruption at the Public Investment Corporation. Holomisa says he will continue to pursue the matter in Parliament. “Well we have taken note of the judgment, however it’s true that one might have limitations outside parliament but the questions I’ve been raising, especially that of conflict of interest, where a former deputy minister and an employee of PIC ended up owning the Harith Company which was established by the government and so on, those questions are not going to be swept under the carpet.” Holomisa says he may consider appealing the judgement. “I am waiting for the reasons for judgement, once we get those and satisfy ourselves that we can appeal, we will do so.  So we’re not just going to be tossed around, we’ve got a right to know about the pensions of the workers.” The litigants in the matter have welcomed the court ruling and are also considering pursuing defamation charges against Holomisa. The PIC manages close to two-trillion rand in funds, most of which belong to the Government Employees Pension Fund. Related video click below:
