The Baby Daniel case will on Thursday continue when murder accused Timothy Naidoo returns to the stand in the High Court in Johannesburg. Naidoo has been charged with the murder of his girlfriend’s child, Baby Daniel. Their names have been changed by court order. On Wednesday Naidoo testified that the death had been an accident. In his evidence Naidoo painted a picture of the close relationship he had with Baby Daniel although he was not his biological father. He cried when he explained what happened the day before Daniel died. The child had stood on the bath while Naidoo had stepped away for a few minutes and then fell in. At the sound of screaming and bumping against the tub, Naidoo rushed back to the bathroom where he took Daniel out of the water. He then put ointment on his skin which had become red. When he saw the pictures of the body for the first time in court on Wednesday he cried saying the child had not been that bad. It also emerged that Naidoo and Daniel’s mom Mary Vermaak had been arguing since the day before.
