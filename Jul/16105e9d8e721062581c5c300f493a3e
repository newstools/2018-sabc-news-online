Another specialised aviation school has opened its doors in Kempton Park, Johannesburg. The Rhodesfield Engineering School of Specialisation teaches students all aspects of the aviation industry. The school is one of 29 schools in Gauteng that have been converted into schools of specialisation. Just a stone’s throw away from one of Africa’s busiest airports, aviation students will now have another space to learn at the Rhodesfield Engineering School of Specialisation. Aviation industry experts will teach aspiring pilots the tricks of the trade. Areas of learning will be technological, technical and mechanical. Teaching will also include mentorship and career guidance. The national department of education says private partnership is important because there is a skills shortage in the country. While learning to fly is costly, some have overcome the challenge and fulfilled their dreams of becoming pilots. More schools of specialisations are set to be launched in the province. A school focusing on automobile will be constructed in Tshwane. The Vaal will also house a maritime school of specialisation. The school is set to be launched in the next two months.
