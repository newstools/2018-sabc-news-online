Thousands of social grant beneficiaries in the Eastern Cape are hoping June’s payment glitches will not be repeated. The South African Post Office experienced technical problems causing delays in grant payments. The Eastern Cape is one of the provinces with the highest number of South Africa Social Security Agency (Sassa) beneficiaries. Last month frustrated recipients resorted to queuing outside post offices as early as 5am. Sassa is assuring beneficiaries that this month payments will run smoothly. “For the month of August, people will see a different government approach in terms of dispensing social grants. Everybody will be happy. There will be no problems. Our teams will be all over South Africa,” says Sassa Eastern Cape Regional Executive Manager, Bandile Maqetuka. Sassa aims to be ready to move the distribution of social grants from Cash Paymaster Services to the Post office by September. “We are planning for September. Now we are doing dry runs; now we are sweeping wherever. It is not ok. Siyalungisa (we are fixing). All systems should go,” Sassa Acting Chief Executive Officer Abraham Mahangu. Beneficiaries remain concerned about the switch over to the Post Office.
