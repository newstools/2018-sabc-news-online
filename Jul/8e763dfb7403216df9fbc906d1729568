President Cyril Ramaphosa is to meet King of AmaZulu, Goodwill Zwelithini, over the weekend to discuss concerns he raised about the possible dissolution of the Ingonyama Trust. On Wednesday the King, during an address to AmaZulu, warned that they would resist any attempt to dissolve the trust – which accounts for about 60% of rural land in Kwa-Zulu Natal. Speaking at the BRICS breakfast meeting in Pretoria on Friday morning, Ramaphosa says government has no intention to take land away from traditional leaders. “I would like to make it very clear… it is not government’s intention to go and grab land from rural communities, land that is under the control of traditional leaders. And, more particularly, we have no intention whatsoever to go and grab the land that is controlled by the Ingonyama Trust. There is just no need for anyone to feel fearful about this… I am going to be meeting with His Majesty the King to address this matter – so that whatever fears he and the Zulu nation has on this matter should be completely dispelled,” says Ramaphosa.
