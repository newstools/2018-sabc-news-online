The Kwazulu Natal leg of Parliament’s public hearings on land expropriation wraps up in Kokstad on Saturday. The hearings by Parliament’s Constitutional Review Committee will move to the Eastern Cape on Monday. The committee has been conducting hearings in the North West and Kwazulu-Natal this past week. The committee which split into two groups has been on a six week road show to possibly review section 25 of the constitution to expropriate land without compensation. The group led by committee co-chairperson Lewis Nzimande will conclude hearings on Saturday at the Kokstad Town Hall in the Harry Gwala District Municipality. They already conducted hearings in Vryheid, Jozini and Pietermaritzburg over the past three days. After concluding the Kokstad public hearings, the same group of committee members will resume the Eastern Cape leg of public hearings at the Umtata Town Hall in the OR Tambo District on Monday. The other group led by co-chairperson Vincent Smith will only resume its Gauteng leg of public hearings at Westonaria in the West Rand District Municipality next Thursday.
