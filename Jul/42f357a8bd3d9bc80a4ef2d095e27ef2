Only a small group of VBS depositors is queuing outside the Nedbank game centre in Thohoyandou in Limpopo on Saturday morning. On Friday, the queue started forming from as early as 3am. Nedbank spokesperson Elelwani Pandelani says they helped about 400 VBS clients at the branch on the first day. “…I must say it was a huge success – because we anticipated having many challenges [but] the only challenge we had was when people were coming forth without the relevant documentation… But where everybody was able to produce the required documentation, we were able to assist each and every client,” explains Pandelani.
