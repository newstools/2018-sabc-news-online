The Democratic Alliance (DA) caucus in the City of Cape Town has passed a no confidence motion in Mayor Patricia de Lille at a meeting on Wednesday night. This vote was requested by councillor Mercia Kleinsmith and was thoroughly debated at the lengthy meeting. DA leader in the Western Cape, Bonginkosi Madikizela says the matter will now be referred to the Federal Executive which will decide on the best course of action. “As it is a norm and a procedure it was then taken to a caucus. Caucus had a long debate about the motion. The Mayor herself was also there and then ultimately the caucus decided to put it into a vote. The outcome of the vote is that out of 144 councillors, who participated, at the vote, 84 voted in favour of the motion. There was 1 spoilt ballot and 59 voted against the motion,” says Madikizela.
