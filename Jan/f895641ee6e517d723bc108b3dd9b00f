A large group of community members have gathered outside Hoerskool Overvaal in Vereeniging. This after a Whatsapp voice note spread in the area calling on community members to gather at the school to stage a protest to preserve the Afrikaans language. On Thursday, protesting EFF and ANC members engaged in a heated argument with community members threatening each other with baseball bats and broomsticks. The protestors were upset over a court ruling that the Afrikaans medium school did not have to take in 55 English speaking learners as other schools nearby could accommodate them. A large contingent of private security guards has also been stationed at the gates of the school, while several police vehicles are parked outside. Despite threats of ongoing protest action by members of the ANC and EFF the situation remains calm.  About Sashin Naidoo View all posts by Sashin Naidoo
