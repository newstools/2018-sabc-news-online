Firefighters have nearly managed to contain a veld fire in a mountainous area at Villiersdorp in the Southern Cape which has been burning for more than a week on multiple flanks. It has destroyed more than 7 000 hectares of vegetation. Cape Winelands Regional Fire Commander, Ian Ross, says the fire poses no threat to property at this stage. He says a team of 12 firefighters with four firefighting vehicles are still monitoring the fire. He says, “The volunteers and our ground teams worked throughout the night to suppress the line and to extinguish it along the mountain.” “There’s still one section of about 800 metres still burning in an inaccessible area. We’ll try and get guys in there today to finish up this fire,” adds Ross. About Corbin August View all posts by Corbin August
