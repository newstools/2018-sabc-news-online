A bail application in a kidnap and murder case against two men accused of killing 56-year-old Lekoko Primary School teacher Thulisile Ngwenya of Riviera Park, is expected to be heard on Friday at the Molopo Magistrate’s Court in the North West. Ngwenya was murdered in Mahikeng late last year. Her car was found abandoned in town and her decomposed body found in the bushes. The suspects, Headboy Njokweni and Sfiso Ndawande, both 51-years-of-age are linked to the killing of Ngwenya. They are facing four charges including kidnapping, murder, rape, and robbery with aggravating circumstances. They were arrested in Johannesburg allegedly after being found in possession of the victim’s cell phone. Earlier the court heard that the first suspect, Ndawande, has nine previous convictions that happened between 1988 and 1990. He still has a pending case of robbery in Ermelo in Mpumalanga. The second suspect, Ndawande, was also previously convicted for robbery at the Vereeniging Magistrate’s Court. About SABC View all posts by SABC
