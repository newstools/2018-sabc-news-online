The bail application of a crime intelligence police officer who allegedly stole more than R500 000 from a secret police slush fund will continue on Tuesday morning. Lesiba Tshabalala, also known as Captain KGB, who was arrested by the IPID last week, was also convicted of armed robbery in 1996 and sentenced to 10 years imprisonment but somehow evaded going to prison until 2013. Tshabalala allegedly defrauded the police service by claiming that more than R400 000 was needed for blinds at a safe house. He then pocketed R200 000. The state is opposing Tshabalalaâ€™s bail application saying his release would endanger the life of potential witnesses.   About SABC View all posts by SABC
