Matric learners who want to write supplementary examinations have until this Friday to register at district offices. The exams will be written between February and March and results will be available at the end of March. The 2017 national matric pass rate for last year was 75.1% – a 2.6% increase from the 72.5 % achieved in 2016. Basic Education spokesperson Elijah Mhlanga has encouraged learners who failed subjects and qualify for supplementary exams to improve their results. “The deadline for those wishing to sit for the supplementary is Friday the 19th of January. So people need to make sure that they go quickly to register there’s not much time left. Once we closed for registration you will not be able to do it. You might lose that opportunity of sitting for the examination again so make sure that you go to a district office they will be able to help you with the form that you need, and any other information that you might require for your preparation for the supplementary examinations,” says Mhlanga.
