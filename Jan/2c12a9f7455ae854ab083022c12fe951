The ANC NEC has discussed President Jacob Zuma’s fate. The matter is now in the hands of the ANC top six. The ANC NEC meeting is currently underway in Pretoria. This is the first ordinary NEC meeting of the newly elected ANC leadership. It appears the future of President Jacob Zuma lies in the hands of the top six officials following the NEC meeting which discussed the issue of his recall last night. Despite the matter not being part of the agenda, SABC sources have learnt that it was raised from the floor. After debating the matter, it’s understood that the officials were tasked with the responsibility of managing the issue by engaging with President Zuma. There appears to be an agreement that by the time 2019 election comes, he should no longer be in office. After the election of Cyril Ramphosa as ANC president last month, the two centres of power debate was re-ignited. Many felt Ramaphosa should take over as the political centre is in Luthuli House. The ANC is expected to clarify this matter upon conclusion of its gathering at St. Georges, in Irene, outside Pretoria. On Thursday, the party’s Secretary General Ace Magashule says the two day meeting of the highest decision making body of the governing party will discuss appeal cases of the KwaZulu-Natal and the Free State PECs among others, but not President Jacob Zuma’s future, he said. The new ANC leadership met in East London last week to draft the January 8 Statement. But pressing issues facing the organisation will only be effectively dealt with in the Pretoria gathering. And  speculation is rife about President Jacob Zuma’s future.  About SABC View all posts by SABC
