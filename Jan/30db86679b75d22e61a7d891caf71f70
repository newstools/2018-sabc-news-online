Trade union National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (Numsa) has vowed to intensify its strike at the Wits University in Johannesburg. Numsa says university management has refused to treat workers like human beings and pay them a living wage. The labour union also demands an end to labour brokering and insourcing. “Our members are some of the lowest earners at the institution and they had no choice but to go on strike. Include in our list of demands is that we demand a 12% increase across the board. We demand an end to insourcing and that all temporary workers must become temporary employees as per the labour law. As Numsa we will intensify the strike and from Sunday we will be staging a picket and protest on campus to highlight our demands,” says Numsa acting spokesperson, Phakamile Hlubi.
