Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini is adamant that her department has done nothing wrong, accusing the media of demonising her. This follows allegations that Social Development department has paid the SABC R500 000 to interview Dlamini. These allegations have raised concerns about the use of taxpayers’ money to secure the interview on the SABC 3 show Real Talk With Anele. Dlamini says, “It’s important for all of us to understand the breakdown of how we have used the money that we have paid the SABC. Who came up with the story, there was a time when I felt the media is demonising me and I think we are going back to that. I don’t have a problem with people raising concerns about what has happened, but also to talk about issues without understanding how we used that R500 000 as Social Development with the SABC is very important.” Click here for more:  About Morning Live View all posts by Morning Live
