Lead Change Developments is an IT training facility for the blind and people living with disabilities in Dobsonville, Soweto. They say they are one of few organisations that are delivering free educational skills without any sponsorship and despite this the NGO has managed to open two classrooms and has reached dozens of individuals. Lead Change Developments offers various Microsoft courses with certificates upon completion and now they would like to extend their services to rural areas. Lead Change Developments Executive Director Shaun Soko says he started the organisation when he realised that there was a need to set it up especially in communities where they reside in. “There were challenges that people with disabilities were facing, especially when it comes to issues of education. There were quite a lot of dangers in travelling that people with disabilities are faced with. At times we heard stories of people being knocked down by cars and some falling into manholes when they were going to the institutions. So we decided to take this concept into the community.”  Click below to watch full interview:  About Morning Live View all posts by Morning Live
