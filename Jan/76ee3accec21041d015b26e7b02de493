The South African Democratic Teachers Union (Sadtu) says it will intensify its protest outside Hoërskool Overvaal in Vereeniging in the Vaal, next week. On Thursday, hundreds of members of unions including Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) and Sadtu and students’ organisation Congress of South African Students (Cosas) marched to the school. This after the High Court in Pretoria found that the Afrikaans medium school did not have the capacity to accommodate 55 English-speaking learners. The school was shut down yesterday but has since reopened. Sadtu’s Tseliso Ledimo says, “The mass action will be rolling. The African National Congress (ANC) for example has already applied for another march that will be staged next week Friday. So community structures will be taking up this matter with their various constituencies, so it’s a big community issue, it does not rest with Sadtu or Cosas or with any one organisation. It’s a big community issue and mass action will be rolling including planning by the ANC.”
