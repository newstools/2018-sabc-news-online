Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa says the corruption scourge continues to deter foreign direct investment. He was addressing the Nedlac meeting in Pretoria East where leaders of various labour movements are discussing measures to stimulate economic growth in order to reduce the high unemployment rate. South Africa’s image has been tarnished as the result of the revelation of state capture, rampant corruption and fraud. This has led to the downgrading of the country’s credit rating, a scenario which has led to high levels of unemployment, poverty and inequality. Ramaphosa says he will ensure that law enforcement agencies act against those implicated in both public and corporate sector corruption. He says Eskom has been having rife theft, corruption and embezzlement which has impeded South Africa’s growth. “In the private sector too they have been stealing money. These people who are responsible must be hunted down and arrested and locked up,” says Ramaphosa. About Tshepo Ikaneng View all posts by Tshepo Ikaneng
