The United Nations Secretary General Chief Antonio Guterres has defended immigration as a positive development for countries while arguing that the global organisation would continue to fight racism in all its forms. He was responding to a question on US President Donald Trump’s alleged derogatory statements regarding immigration from Africa and Haiti to the United States. “As far as I understand, the United States President has denied that he has said that. Our position is very clear, we need to have relations of mutual respect with all peoples in the world and in particular migration is a positive aspect.” “And migrants contribute not only to the welfare to their countries of origin but to the welfare of the countries where they are part of the development process. The respect for migrants and the respect for diversity, the ethnic diversity, religious diversity, is a fundamental pillar of the UN and it will be a fundamental pillar of the action of the Secretary General,” says Guterres.
