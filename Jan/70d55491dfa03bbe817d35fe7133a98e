Trade union federation, Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) in the Western Cape will be protesting outside the Cape Town City Council on Sunday to highlight the impact the water crisis has on poor families. Secretary, Tony Ehrenreich says residents on the Cape Flats will be the hardest hit when the city reaches Day Zero in late April. “When we run out of water, it’s going to lead to disease and death on the Cape Flats. It’s going to lead to job losses and the closing of factories that need water to continue their operations. The City has entirely mismanaged this problem.” “That’s why we bringing it to protest action at the city’s council offices on Sunday. There are a number of things the City can do to address the crisis. Amongst them is desalination, better water recycling and also better water management as there’s also no cost to the wealthy,” says Ehrenreich.
