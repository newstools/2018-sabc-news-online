Former Gauteng Health MEC, Qedani Mahlangu is expected to appear before the Life Esidimeni Arbitration hearings in Johannesburg as the hearings continue. Mahlangu’s appearance follows Friday’s testimony by Deputy Director-General for Mental Health in Gauteng, Hannah Jacobus. Jacobus revealed for the first time that it was Mahlangu who made the decision to terminate the long-standing contract with Life Esidimeni, forcing patients to be transferred to ill-equipped NGOs, where 143 of them subsequently died.
