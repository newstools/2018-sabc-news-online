The South African Democratic Teachers Union (Sadtu) says it is shocked and angered by the Reiger Park High School’s sex scandal. This after videos and photos of the former school principal went viral on social media, showing him having sex with pupils in his office. Sadtu Secretary General, Mugwena Maluleke says, “I have not seen the videos but, my colleagues have shared with me what they have seen, and indeed we were shocked as an organisation. We also angered that we are not seeing a decline in this kind of conduct from our own colleagues that are supposed to be caring for our children, because teaching is nothing but caring for our children.” Maluleke says as Sadtu they are determined to root out this kind of behaviour out of the profession.
