Embattled South African international retail holding company, Steinhoff International, has withdrawn its sponsorship of the Springbok Men’s and Women’s, and SA Rugby Sevens Academy teams. The teams will no longer carry the company’s logo. SA Rugby CEO, Jurie Roux, says they have been informed by Steinhoff of the decision and its intention to withdraw it’s sponsorship of Sevens rugby with immediate effect. Roux said that the process had already begun to identify an alternative partner. The Blitzboks hope to defend their World Rugby Sevens Series and Commonwealth Games titles this year and then challenge the Sevens Rugby World Cup title in San Francisco in July.
