Suspected Boko Haram suicide bombers killed 12 people and injured 48 others in an attack on Wednesday, on the northeastern Nigerian city of Maiduguri, officials from the State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA) for Borno said. Two bombers struck a market in the Muna Garage area on the outskirts of Maiduguri late on Wednesday afternoon, the SEMA officials said. Muna Garage is the site of a camp for displaced people and a frequent target of Boko Haram attacks. In recent weeks, Nigeria’s military has embarked on an offensive against the Islamist insurgency in the north eastern state of Borno, the epicentre for much of the conflict, which began in 2009. That has not stopped Boko Haram’s attacks, which target both civilians and the military. About Reuters View all posts by Reuters
