Suspended acting national police commissioner Khomotso Phahlane says unending allegations of corrupt behaviour against him are hurting his family. Phahlane has been on suspension since July last year. Phahlane spoke to the SABC in Pretoria where he opened his heart about recent developments in his life, including allegations that controversial crime intelligence officer Morries Tshabalala, also known as Captain KGB has links with him. He also referred to corruption and money laundering allegations against him. “All that goes with I have built a house of R8 million. So someone must come and prove to you and the nation that there is a house which was built for eight million rands. My transactions are documented, so I am not going to go around circle on that. It is not for me to prove, it is for them to prove what they have been alleging. I’m on record that’s why I am saying to you my conscience is not bothering me. I am asking do they have the integrity. Is their conscience clean?” About SABC View all posts by SABC
