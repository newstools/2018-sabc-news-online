The terms of reference for the Commission of Inquiry into alleged “state capture” have been officially published. According to the terms of reference, the Commission must investigate the truth of allegations that former Deputy Finance Minister Mcebisi Jonas and former ANC MP Vytjie Mentor were offered Cabinet positions by the Gupta family. The terms also stipulate that there must also be a probe as to whether there were irregularities, undue enrichment and corruption in the awarding of contracts, mining licences and government advertising in the Gupta owned New Age newspapers. The publication will pave the way for Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo to begin the proceedings of the commission, expected to last for six months. The Department of Justice published the terms of reference for the Commission of Inquiry into alleged “state capture”. Justice Minister Michael Masutha on Wednesday indicated that the terms of references will be published in the Government Gazette, but may not be final. “The terms of references can be amended and that is stated in the terms of references. They are never cast in stone. After they’ve been published the judge can then put together his team,” said Masutha.
