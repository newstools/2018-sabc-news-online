The Department of Infectious Diseases at Groote Schuur hospital in Cape Town has cautioned the public not to panic over the fungal disease known as Emergomyces Africanus. The disease was initially detected in the Western Cape. Professor Sipho Dlamini of Groote Schuur Hospital says those who are severely immunosuppressed, are most at risk. “This particular fungi affects people with a weakened immune system, so people with strong immune systems are by and large not affected; it’s those with weakened immune systems and certainly those who have an advance HIV disease, meaning people whose immune system is very well, when it comes to HIV infections.”  About SABC View all posts by SABC
