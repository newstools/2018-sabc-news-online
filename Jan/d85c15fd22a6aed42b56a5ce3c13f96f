Parents of learners at Hoërskool Overvaal in Vereeniging in the Vaal say they fear for the safety of their children. This follows Wednesday’s violent protest in which eight people were wounded and at least 10 arrested. Protesters from the African National Congress (ANC) and the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) gathered in front of the school. They were upset over a court ruling that the Afrikaans medium school did not have to take in 55 English speaking learners as other nearby schools could accommodate them. A large contingent of private security guards is currently stationed at the school gate while several police vehicles are parked outside. Parents are also sitting in their vehicles outside, keeping watch over the situation. A small group of ANC supporters are present.  About Sashin Naidoo View all posts by Sashin Naidoo
