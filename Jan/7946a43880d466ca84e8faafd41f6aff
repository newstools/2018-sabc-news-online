African National Congress (ANC) struggle stalwart Winnie Madikizela-Mandela has been admitted to the Milpark Hospital in Johannesburg for a kidney infection. In a statement, the Mandela family says prior to being hospitalised, she was uncomfortable and complained of loss of appetite and one of her legs was painful. The statement further says upon admission it was discovered that she had an infection that had affected her kidneys. She is expected to spend approximately a week at the hospital. The family says Madikizela-Mandela is in high spirits and she’s constantly surrounded by family. She successfully underwent a minor knee surgery last year. Earlier in January, Madikizela-Mandela had her appeal to get her hands on the Mandela house in Qunu dismissed by the Supreme Court of Appeal. Madikileza-Mandela had challenged the ownership of the Mandela home in Qunu in the Eastern Cape, arguing she was the rightful owner. She claimed that she only found out in 2014 that the property was registered in former President Nelson Mandela’s name and that it was part of his will. Madiba bequeathed the property to the Nelson Rholihlahla Mandela Family Trust. Click video below:  About SABC View all posts by SABC
