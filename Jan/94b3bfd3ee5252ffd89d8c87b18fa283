The Standing Committee on Public Accounts (Scopa) has raised concerns about expansion and deviation of some Transnet contracts,  that appear to be constantly extended. Scopa is also concerned about the nature of the relationship between Transnet and the National Treasury in relation to the approval of the expansion and deviation of contracts. Scopa has agreed with the National Treasury that they will be briefed on a quarterly basis on expansions and deviations. This will allow Scopa to monitor Transnet’s contracts closely. Scopa has also informed Transnet that the latter is liable for the costs which amounts to fruitless and wasteful expenditure that were incurred by members of Scopa when they travelled to Cape Town for the hearing that was not honoured by Transnet on December 06, 2017. Scopa chair Themba Godi says there are companies whose contracts get renewed all the time like the case of Bidvest subsidiary Protea coin whose contract was extended 13 times which was the longest contract they have ever seen.
