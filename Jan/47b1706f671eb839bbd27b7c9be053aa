Several learners from Hoerskool Overvaal in Vereeniging are receiving counselling for trauma caused by protests outside the school. The violent clashes have led to several people being arrested this week. The protest was sparked by a Pretoria High Court Ruling that the Afrikaans medium school did not have space to take in 55 English speaking learners. Director of ‘New Foundation Generation’, Pierre Ronquest, from the organisation roped in by the school to counsel the affected learners says they have identified that there are some learners showing signs of trauma. He says, “Its obvious they see stuff they’re not used to. They see protestors in the media and on tv, but this was close to home, it was right in front of our main gate. We want to coach them through this.”  About Sashin Naidoo View all posts by Sashin Naidoo
