Economist Iraj Abedian says corruption at Eskom started as far back as when the current Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba was in the Public Enterprises portfolio. Government appointed a new board at Eskom with Telkom Chairperson Jabu Mabuza as the power utility’s new chairperson. Mabuza has replaced Zithembe Khoza who has resigned. The new board includes prominent health academic Professor Malegapuru Makgoba. Government recommended that the new Eskom board choose Phakamane Hadebe, a former Land Bank CEO and top manager at Absa, as acting group chief executive. Government has also directed Eskom to appoint a new group chief financial officer for the parastatal within three months. Abedia says Eskom’s new board and management will have to clean up the mess at the power utility. “At the same time, it’s so important that we get the energy policy right…The culture of looting and destroying is not sustainable and there has been nine years of it unashamedly. Politicians in the name of leadership have done it. Executives in the name of being business leaders have done nothing but disrupt businesses. You’ve seen it in Eskom, you’ve seen it in Transnet, you’ve seen it in SAA, you’ve seen it in Denel and you’ve seen it in government operations.” Watch the video below for related content:  About SABC View all posts by SABC
