Mineral Resources Deputy Minister Godfrey Oliphant will meet with Northern Cape Premier Sylvia Lucas and illegal miners or the so-called Zama Zamas in an effort to deal with the ongoing illegal mining in the province. Oliphant is expected to find solutions to the problem and help the illegal miners to comply with mining regulations. Zama Zamas in the province have in recent months made headlines as they demanded to be legalised. Chief of staff in the deputy ministers’ office, Solomon Rasmeni says the deputy minister will meet the leaders of the illegal miners. He says: “We do not tolerate illegal mining in South Africa, its a criminal offence. There are ways to deal with the problem so that people are not involved in crime.” “There are other ways in how they can do certain activities without being involved in crime,” adds Rasmeni.
