The Thohoyandou High Court in Limpopo has started handing down sentence in the case of a 45-year-old female traffic officer who has been found guilty of murder and kidnapping. Masingita Chabane-Mashau was found guilty of killing 17-year-old Hlulani Maswanganyi. She was also found guilty of kidnapping Maswanganyi and her then one-month-old son in October 2015. As part of handing down his sentence, Judge Fransis Kganyago has told court that a state pyschologist that assessed Chabane-Mashau described her as a person who is not a credible witness. He read that the psychologist also found her to be deceptive. Judge Kganyago also read that Mashau portrayed herself to the psychologist as self serving and a person with no regard for other peopleâ€™s feelings. The report further describes Chabane-Mashau as a person who has shown no remorse and has no regard for breaking the law. About SABC Radio View all posts by SABC Radio
