The Hawks have confirmed that they have raided the offices of former Free State Premier Ace Magashule and the Agriculture Department in Bloemfontein. The raids are connected to the Gupta family-linked Estina dairy farm project. Close to 100 emerging black farmers that government set to empower through the controversial 220-million-rand project were used to allegedly advance corruption by the Gupta family. Earlier this week, the unit also raided the farm to assess its assets. Hawks spokesperson Hangwani Mulaudzi says they have a strong case against the suspects. “We are dealing with the criminal aspect of our investigation where we are trying to tie up all information of whatever evidence we collected which will then be forwarded to the NPA for the decision if there is a need to go to court or not. The AFU is part and parcel of the NPA. Theirs is more on a civil matters where they attach assets of the suspects,” says Mulaudzi.  About SABC View all posts by SABC
