The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) has called on the African National Congress (ANC) to ensure that its Secretary-General Ace Magashule steps down from his position in the party. The call comes after the Hawks raided the offices of Magashule and the Agriculture Department in Bloemfontein. The raids are connected to the controversial Estina dairy farm project in Vrede. More than R220 million meant for the project has been paid to companies linked to the politically-connected Gupta family. Earlier this week, the Asset Forfeiture Unit also raided the farm to assess its assets. EFF spokesperson Mbuyiseni Ndlozi says the ruling party must stick to its commitment to fighting corruption among its members. “The ANC, when charges have been put and serious charges of corruption have been put against Ace Magashule, we hope they will be consistent because they said when any of them are facing serious allegations they will step down from responsibilities that they occupy so we will expect the ANC’s Secretary-General to follow on that word. This is important because they must all not be given space to interfere with the Hawks doing their work,” says Ndlozi.
