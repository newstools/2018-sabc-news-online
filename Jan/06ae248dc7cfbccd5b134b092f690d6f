Former acting Eskom CEO, Matshela Koko says he had never met any of the Gupta brothers. He faced questions from MPs following the viewing of a Carte Blanche video in which Koko was interviewed about the Gupta-linked Tegeta-Optimum coal deal. African National Congress MP Zukile Luyenge wanted to know whether Koko had ever met members of the Indian business family. In his response, Koko mentioned the former CEO of Gupta-linked Oakbay, Nazeem Howa, and other business figures. Koko says, “I do not know and I have not met any of the Gupta brothers I see on the pictures. I have met Mr Howa, I have met Ashu (Chawla), I have met Salim Essa…Salim Essa I met him a couple of times. He is a shareholder of Trillian and he met me a compile of times to discuss the Trillian  transaction with McKinsey.” Earlier, the Democratic Alliance (DA) member of the Eskom Parliamentary inquiry, Natasha Mazzone, refuted Koko’s testimony that he personally paid all the costs for his trip to Dubai in January 2016. When Koko was cross-examined by evidence leader Nthuthuzelo Vanara on Wednesday, Koko said he had paid for all the costs himself.
