Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa, who is also African National Congress (ANC) president, says the governing party is taking active steps to renew South Africa and its economy. He was addressing a breakfast gathering in Sandton in the north of Johannesburg ahead of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland next week. Ramaphosa, who will lead a South African delegation to the forum, shared a table with Ministers Malusi Gigaga, Jeff Radebe, Rob Davies, BrandSA CEO Kingston Makhubela and Black Business Council CEO Bonang Mohale. Ramaphosa has highlighted the importance of starting a new phase as a country. “The governing party came out with what I believe is a very powerful message of seeking to renew not only the governing party, but also our country…I want to stress this part because as South Africans we are renewing ourselves and uniting ourselves and also coming out of that period of uncertainty and darkness.” Watch Cyril Ramaphosa’s keynote address:  About SABC View all posts by SABC
