The High Court in Pretoria has just ruled that Brian Molefe had indeed resigned from Eskom as CEO and therefore is ordered to payback R11 million of the pension payout he received from the power utility. The court also ordered that the payment be made within 10 days. Judge Elias Matojane read out the judgment, “A…The decision taken by the board of Eskom in November 2016 to accept Molefe’s early retirement proposal is reviewed and set aside. B….The decision made by the minister to appoint and reinstate Molefe to the position of GCEO at Eskom is reviewed and set aside. C….It is declared that any payment or some of money received by Molefe under any purported pension agreement between him and Eskom is invalid, and Molefe is ordered to repay such amounts within 10 days of this house.”    About SABC View all posts by SABC
