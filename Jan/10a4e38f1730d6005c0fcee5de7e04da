The European Union says it’s ready to review its policies towards Zimbabwe, to take into account the recent developments in the country. This follows a meeting of an EU consultative body in Brussels this week where Zimbabwe’s transition from the 37-year-long Mugabe era was discussed. The EU has welcomed the new Zimbabwean government’s commitment to hold elections this year in line with the Constitution but says the vote must be peaceful, inclusive, credible and transparent. The EU has been at odds with Zimbabwe for years, but now it says Zimbabwe has created high expectations among its people. The EU has affirmed its availability to engage with the new authorities through structured political dialogue with political actors across the spectrum and with civil society. It says the upcoming electoral process will be an essential step and if it is invited it would be available for observation, provided that the required conditions are fulfilled.
