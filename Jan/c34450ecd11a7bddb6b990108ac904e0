The National Funeral Practitioners Association of South Africa (NAFUPA) says from the first of February 2018, non-black owned funeral companies will not be able to operate in predominantly black areas in South Africa. The statement was posted on the association’s Facebook page and reads, “Indian and white owned funeral companies will not be allowed to enter our townships and villages”. The statement has caused a public outcry with some suggesting it will cause further racial tensions in the country. NAFUPA Secretary-General Nkosentsha Shezi, however, is adamant that this does not amount to racism but that it is rather an effort to support black-owned businesses in township communities. He says, “I think racism is to keep the majority of people in areas that are not livable. This is not racism, this is to say that we don’t want people who reside outside these township areas to come in and steal economic opportunities that could be used to boost township economy and rural economy.” Meanwhile, General Secretary of the National Funeral Parlours Association Bonginkosi Ndaba says funeral companies should be allowed to operate in whichever area they wish. “We don’t understand why NAFUPA-SA wants to ban other nations to come and trade in so called African townships. Firstly, we are a multi-racial organisation. We have Indian members and white companies in our association and this is because we believe that we are one,” says Ndaba.
