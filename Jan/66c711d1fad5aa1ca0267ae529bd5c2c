A 29-year-old businessman is on Monday expected to appear in court in connection with the kidnapping and killing of a 20-year-old Durban woman. Siam Lee was allegedly abducted outside her workplace in Margaret Maytom avenue in Durban North earlier this month. Two days later a burnt body was found in the New Hanover area in the KwaZulu-Natal midlands. Family members later identified the remains but police say they are still waiting for conclusive DNA results. At the Hillcrest house where the suspect was arrested, police also recovered a firearm and a vehicle which is believed to have been used in the kidnapping.
