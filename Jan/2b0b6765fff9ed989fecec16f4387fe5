South African business leaders have called for a boycott of US President Donald Trump’s address at the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland next week. This follows Trump’s derogatory comments about countries in Africa‚ El Salvador and Haiti earlier this month. Trump faced global backlash over the comments he made during a meeting about US immigration policy. CEO of Business Leadership South Africa, Bonang Mohale says the boycott is the only way to protests against Trump’s comments. She says: “We have been left with no choice but to boycott the address of the President of the USA when he addresses the delegates at Davos in protest against these divisive comments and continued failure to unequivocally apologize.” “Therefore, we encourage like-minded peers to do the same. We have never felt hurt and exposed to such indignity as it comes from the biggest economy in the world,” she adds. About SABC Radio View all posts by SABC Radio
