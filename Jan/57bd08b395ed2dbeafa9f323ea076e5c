The South African Revenue Service (SARS) is reminding individual taxpayers who filed personal income tax returns in 2017, were assessed and found to owe SARS money, that they have until January 31 to pay. According to SARS, almost 240 000 individual taxpayers fall into this category. Acting SARS spokesperson Sicelo Mkosi has warned that these taxpayers will face actions, such as penalties, interest as well as criminal charges if they do not pay by this deadline. He, however, says SARS does make an allowance for taxpayers in financial difficulty, to approach it in order to defer payment or pay in instalments within qualifying criteria.
