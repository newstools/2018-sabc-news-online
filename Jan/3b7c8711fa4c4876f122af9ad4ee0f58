Political analyst Sethulego Matebesi has described the Hawks raid conducted at Ace Magashule’s offices as a blow to the outgoing Free State premier. The raid was extended to the offices of the Agriculture Department in Bloemfontein on Friday. The raids are connected to the controversial Estina Dairy Farm project in Vrede. More than R220-million meant for the project has been paid to companies linked to the politically-connected Gupta family. Earlier this week, the Asset Forfeiture Unit also raided the farm to assess its assets. Matebesi explains: “This is an indication. It’s definitely indicative that the ANC is serious about corruption and they are acting against this. But at the end of the day for the premier personally and the current chairperson of the African National Congress, I do not think this is good for him because this is indicative that there are a lot of things he did not handle in the right way and one of the things he should have done is to at least have acted against such serious allegations.” The Hawks have called an urgent meeting with dozens of intended beneficiaries of the Estina dairy farm project in Vrede in the Free State on Saturday. One of the intended beneficiaries, Luvuno Khubeka, is anxiously waiting to meet the Hawks. “I’m happy that the Hawks might help us to get through this. I’m waiting so that they can call me to ask me about what is happening in Vrede. It was difficult for me because what I was looking for was to put bread on the table at home. Until now, we’ve got nothing.”    About Aphumelele Mdlalane View all posts by Aphumelele Mdlalane
