Democratic Alliance (DA) leader Mmusi Maimane says he is not satisfied with the manner in which the City of Cape Town municipality has dealt with the water crisis, particularly the communication aspect. Maimane was joined by Western Cape Premier Helen Zille, Deputy Mayor of Cape Town Ian Nielsen and others, at a briefing on the plan of action to manage the water crisis. He has stressed that the situation is dire with Day Zero now expected on April 12, less than 80 days away. Maimane says the only way to defeat Day Zero is to use less water. “To avoid Day Zero, in the immediate term, is by further reducing demand. There’s no silver bullet, there’s no clever plan, there’s no clever device, and it’s about us reducing demand. Those are the short term facts, and that’s the reality we have to confront,” says Maimane. Click here to watch more:  About Berenice Moss View all posts by Berenice Moss
