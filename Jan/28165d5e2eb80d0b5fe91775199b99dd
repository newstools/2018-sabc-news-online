Cell phone provider Vodacom says its Gauteng based customers should now be able to make and receive calls. Earlier a number of customers complained that their phone lines were down. Vodacom has apologised for the inconvenience. “We were down for about an hour affecting most of Johannesburg, people were unable to make phone calls. Internet connectivity was working but our technicians have been out obviously prioritised the issue and they’ve managed to resolve it. From what I understand everything was back to normal about 5-10 minutes ago,” says spokesperson Byron Kennedy About Thabile Mbhele View all posts by Thabile Mbhele
