The Department of Justice says it will publish the terms of reference for the Commission of Inquiry into alleged Sstate capture late on Wednesday or Thursday morning. The department has confirmed that President Jacob Zuma has finalised the terms of reference, which will pave the way for Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo to begin the proceedings of the commission. The commission will probe allegations that the wealthy Gupta family used their friendship with President Zuma to influence the appointment of Cabinet Ministers and to benefit from lucrative multi-million rand tenders at state owned enterprises. Justice Minister Michael Masutha says the terms of references are ready to be promulgated and published in the Government Gazette. He says, “Because the terms were only signed by the President on Tuesday, we will also be interacting with the judge to ensure that the resourcing of the commission flows and when there are financial difficulties we engage the Treasury to ensure that we obtain the necessary support to give effect to this.” About Tshepo Ikaneng View all posts by Tshepo Ikaneng
