President of labour federation Saftu, Zwelinzima Vavi says it’s a shame that the Vrede dairy farm in the Free State was used to benefit those who are politically connected, not the poorest of the poor. This after the Assets Forfeiture Unit moved swiftly to seize the controversial farm. Vavi says he is happy that the unit has acted on their complaint which the lodged following reports that politicians in partnership with the Gupta family had looted money from the farm. According to leaked Gupta emails, R30 million was laundered to the family. The money originally belonged to Estina, a company that won a tender of R500 million to build the farm. Vavi has praised the unit for its quick response. He says: “We were complaining that money have been looted from South Africans purse.” “It is abuse of the tender processes, typical tenderpreneurship activity which is not about advancing the interest of any worker or economy. So that’s a scheme to milk SA dry and to creme off everything that belongs to us,” adds Vavi.  About Ismael Modiba View all posts by Ismael Modiba
