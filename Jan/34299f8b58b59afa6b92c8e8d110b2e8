Police spokesperson Vuyo Mhaga says stability will make it possible to restore public confidence in the South African Police Services (SAPS). Police Minister Fikile Mbalula says there’s an urgent need to replace Lieutenant-General Richard Mdluli, before the end of next month. At a media briefing in Pretoria on Wednesday, Mbalula announced the sacking of Mdluli. Mhaga says SAPS want to refocus its priorities and fulfill its mandate of addressing crime in communities. “On Wednesday the Minister said we will have a panel of experts that anyone who thinks is fit and proper to be the head of the Hawks must come forward, to make sure we get these people of integrity that we are looking for. So hopefully going forward we are putting that path of people who’ve got those kind of issues behind us and we make sure that we stabilise and originalise the SAPS.” Click below to watch full interview:   About Morning Live View all posts by Morning Live
