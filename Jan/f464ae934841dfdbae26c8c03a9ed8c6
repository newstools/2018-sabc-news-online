The African National Congress and the opposition have welcomed the terms of reference for the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture. The ANC’s Zizi Kodwa hopes the commission will clear the name of the party. “Remember the allegations left a black spot, the commission must leave no stone unturned.” Democratic Alliance leader Mmusi Maimane says the correct people must be appointed. “The commission must start its work and appoint competent people.” “We want legal representation in the commission to make sure all evidence is interrogated,” added EFF’s Mbuyiseni Ndlozi.
