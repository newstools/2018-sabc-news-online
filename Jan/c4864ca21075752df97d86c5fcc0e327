Department of Water and Sanitations spokesperson, Sputnik Ratau says the focus on water crises has been on the Western Cape because the situation in Western Cape is dire, and there has been some form of recovery in other provinces of water resources.

He says South Africa’s consumption patterns haven’t changed, considering the fact that we have seen less rainfall “We are really concerned about the consumption patterns because they are above the guidelines. It is only now whereby the city of Cape Town is going into even stricter restrictions of Level 6B that we are beginning to see a reduction in consumption but it is still not sufficient.”  Click below to watch full interview:   In Kwa-Zulu Natal, water restrictions have been experienced and some communities go without water for a week or more.
