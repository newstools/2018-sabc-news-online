Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema has taken his voter registration campaign to his home town Seshego outside Polokwane in Limpopo. The EFF won the ward in Masakaneng in the previous local government elections. Meanwhile, African National Congress (ANC) deputy secretary-general Jessie Duarte will also be wooing potential voters in Seshego. Malema and Duarte will be wooing potential voters to register on the voters’ roll in Seshego. The two leaders are expected to interact with potential voters as the voter registration weekend kicks-off. Duarte is expected to wrap up her voter registration campaign at Mogalakwena in Mokopane while Malema will continue his campaign in and around Seshego until Sunday. Meanwhile, ANC President Cyril Ramaphosa is headed to the home of party Winnie Madikizela-Mandela in Orlando, Soweto, from where he will take her to a voting station to verify her details.   Earlier, Ramaphosa verified his details at Hitekani Primary School in Soweto. Ramaphosa is one of the top brass who are visiting various communities across the country to urge all eligible voters to register and verify their details. He says registering to vote will assist in improving the country’s democracy. “I have registered and they’ve given me a proof of application of registration. I want to urge all South Africans that it is a good thing to do to go and check your registration [status]. If you have moved or changed your residence, you should go and check. I urge all of you to take responsibility of being citizens of this beautiful country very seriously and contribute to improving our democracy by registering [to vote],” adds Ramaphosa.
