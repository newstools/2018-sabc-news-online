Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba says he did not have any role in the interfering in the tender processes during the time when he was Public Enterprises Minister. Gigaba is appearing before the Eskom Parliamentary Inquiry into alleged state capture. He has been called to explain his role in allegedly influencing tender processes, the degeneration of the Eskom board, his relationship with the Gupta family and his alleged influence over board appointments at State Owned Entities. Gigaba explained to the inquiry: “The Minister of Public Enterprises does not have a role in procurement. The only time that  procurement issues serve before the Minister is when certain large tenders require PFMA approval, and are therefore submitted to both the Minister of Finance and Public Enterprises. Let me explain when this happened… Materiality thresholds are determined at every SOC (State Owned Companies). Materiality thresholds require section 54 PFMA approval from the Minister. They are different at each SOC because they are determined among others, by asset value.” Watch the Eskom Parliamentary Inquiry below:   About Mercedes Besent View all posts by Mercedes Besent
