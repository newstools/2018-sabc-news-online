The City of Tshwane has suspended water supply to residents of the greater Hammanskraal precinct, north of Pretoria. According to the Tshwane municipality, some water pumps have been flooded leading to the Temba treatment plant being switched off. The Tshwane municipality says the switching off of the treatment plant is aimed at enabling the flooded area and pumps to dry up. The affected areas include Temba, Hammanskraal, Babelegi and Stinkwater. The Tshwane municipality says it will take at least two days before the water supply operations to the affected areas could be resumed. Meanwhile, Johannesburg’s Emergency Services has appealed to parents to be vigilant of their children’s whereabouts amid bad weather conditions and flooding.
