Veteran SABC Television News Editor Alph Modiba is being laid to rest on Saturday at his home village of Lebalangwe in North West. The 60 year-old passed away on Monday after spending four months in hospital following a car crash. Family, friends and colleagues have gathered at the family home to bid him farewell. At the time of his passing, Modiba worked at the public broadcaster’s Limpopo region. Colleague Mike Maringa says Modiba was an excellent editor: “He was very blunt, Bra Alph was super intelligent, I can bare witness to that… In our unit, we knew that he was very sharp. When you are writing a story and there were words we didn’t know, or how we are going to structure that story – we knew we had a very good boss.” About SABC Radio View all posts by SABC Radio
