Chief Executive Officer of the Youth Employment Service (YES), Tashmia Ismail-Saville says the initiative will accommodate youth that has no matric, Grade 12 certificate holders and graduates. This follows the launch of YES by President Cyril Ramaphosa on Tuesday, which is in collaboration with the private sector in an effort to create one million jobs. The initiative aims at bringing the change in the lives of many young South Africans in cities, towns, and villages. Ismail-Saville says, “We have 5.9 million young people in South Africa that are not employed, and most of them are not even in  employment training or education. So the objective of YES is to be able to work on the other side of the economy to try and build new spaces, places and pathways for the youth to be able to transition to the economy.” Click below for more:   About Morning Live View all posts by Morning Live
