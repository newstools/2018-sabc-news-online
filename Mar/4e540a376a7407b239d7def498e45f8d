The South African Policing Union (Sapu) has criticised recent top police appointments, calling them awards to those loyal to national police commissioner General Khehla Sitole. The union refers to Sitole’s appointment  of Leutentant  General Jacob Tsumane as the deputy national commissioner for Crime Detection and Lieutenant General Ntombenhle Vuma to deputy national commissioner, Management Advisory Services. Sapu says it’s of the firm view that the national police commissioner is making appointments on the basis of their loyalty to him instead of qualifications and capacity for the respective posts. General Sitole’s office has yet to react to the criticism. About ANA View all posts by ANA
