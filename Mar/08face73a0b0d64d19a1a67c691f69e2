Political analyst, Joleen Steyn-Kotze says the Democratic Alliance (DA) should draw important lessons from the African National Congress (ANC) ahead of next year’s national elections. The DA’s disciplinary hearing against Cape Town Mayor Patricia de Lille will get under way on Tuesday. The party wants to remove her from her mayoral position following allegations of corruption and maladministration in the city. De Lille has denied any wrongdoing. Meanwhile DA leader, Mmusi Maimane has been nominated unopposed for the position of the party leader ahead of its federal congress in Tshwane on April. Kotze has urged the DA to deal with internal matters to avoid factions in the party. “I think the DA is walking a very fine line. It is a large party within the Cape Town City Metro, and as we have seen with the ANC, once party reaches a large majority especially within government, it does tend to open itself up to various factional battles, political score settling and so forth. So, I think the DA needs to draw a few lessons from what has happened to the ANC and in moving forward to try and squash those issues around the contestation of De Lille’s mayorship, just to make sure it builds sufficient political trust for the 2019 general election.”  Click below for more on the story: <a href="https://iono.fm/e/542043">Content hosted by iono.fm</a> About SABC Radio View all posts by SABC Radio
