The Cape Town Weather Bureau has issued a warning for possible flooding on Thursday mainly in the central Karoo and the Eden District in the Western Cape. A weather forecaster, Mmathapelo Makgabutlane, says no further activity is expected in the two regions from Thursday night once the rain has passed. Makgabutlane says the Cape Metropole can also expect light showers on Thursday. “We’re still expecting on and off showers and light rain on Thursday for the Cape Metro, and then the weekend, on Friday a very small possibility of light early morning showers, otherwise cloudy conditions prevailing and for the rest of the weekend, partly cloudy conditions and a little bit of warming in the temperatures, with no further rain expected.” About SABC View all posts by SABC
