Life Esidimeni arbitrator, Justice Dikgang Moseneke says the deaths of 144-mentally ill patients were not natural. This after the State, trade union Solidarity and Section 27 concluded that the families of the deceased mentally-ill patients should be compensated. The proposed compensation was R200 000 – which would cover funeral costs and claims for emotional trauma. Section27 also wanted R1.5 million for the violation of the rights of the victims. Moseneke  released a condensed final Life Esidimeni report in Parktown, Johannesburg on Monday. He says: The deaths of the mental health care users were not natural, but costs unlawfully and negligently by the employees of the government and that liability for the loss of affected families falls to the government.” “For its part the government contends that it is liable to compensate the families of the deceased, and the mental health care users who survived the marathon project, and their families, for estimated funeral expenses and common law general damages arising from pain, suffering and emotional shock. To that end the government tendered an amount of R200 000”.   About SABC Radio View all posts by SABC Radio
