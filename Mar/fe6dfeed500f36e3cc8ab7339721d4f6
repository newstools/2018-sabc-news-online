The social security agency Sassa has taken over the co-ordination of disaster relief efforts in the City of Cape Town. This follows Sassa’s decision to reassess its policies and procedures in funding NGOs which provide social relief. Mayoral Committee Member for Social Services, JP Smith says the new procedure entails that the City’s Disaster Risk Management Centre notifies Sassa of incidents in which relief is required. He says Sassa will then notify the service provider and monitor relief efforts.  About Corbin August View all posts by Corbin August
