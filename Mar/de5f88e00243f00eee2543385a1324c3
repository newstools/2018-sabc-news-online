Apple Inc‘s Chief Executive Tim Cook on Saturday called for “calm heads” and more open trade, amid rising fears of a trade war between the United States and China. Trade tension between China and the United States flared this week when President Donald Trump unveiled plans on Thursday to slap tariffs on potentially up to $60 billion in Chinese goods. China’s Commerce Ministry on Friday urged the United States to “pull back from the brink”, saying it was not afraid to engage in a trade war. Speaking to reporters on the side-lines of the annual China Development Forum in Beijing, Cook said he hoped “calm heads” would prevail. About Reuters View all posts by Reuters
