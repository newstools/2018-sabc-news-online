Former real estate agent Vicki Momberg has been sentenced to three years in prison with one year suspended in the Randburg Magistrateâ€™s Court in the north of Johannesburg. Momberg was found guilty of crimen injuria in November last year. This after she was seen shouting racial slurs at a black police officer who was trying to assist her after she was involved in an alleged smash and grab incident. Bystanders recorded the incident and it went viral. In June 2017, the Equality Court awarded damages of R100 000 to Constable Clement Mkhondo after he was verbally assaulted by Momberg. The court said Momberg was found to have been in a state of mind where she could appreciate the wrongfulness of her actions and was able to target her abuse at her victims.
