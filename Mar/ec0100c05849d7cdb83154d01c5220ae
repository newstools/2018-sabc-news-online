Gauteng Department of Correctional Services Regional Commissioner, Grace Molatedi, says they are putting systems in place, and are updating their strategy on gang members continuously, in order to be able to deal with challenges and dynamics they face as the Department. This comes after the death of an inmate after a stabbing at the Leeuwkop Medium B Correctional Centre in Johannesburg. The Correctional Services Department has since assured the public that it will maintain high levels of security in their facilities. However, the Police and Prisons Civil Rights Union (Popcru) has accused the Department of failing to put an end to drug trade and overcrowding in correctional centres. “We have seen a decrease in the number of correctional officers across the country, and we have a prison population that grows on a daily basis, while training for correctional officers can only take a thousand people on a yearly basis. It becomes impossible for an officer to control the inmates when one officer is in charge of a large number of people,” says Popcru spokesperson Richard Mamabolo.
