The Democratic Alliance (DA) in the North West says it will support the proposed debate on a motion of no-confidence in Premier Supra Mahumapelo. The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) has requested the motion. The party has also asked the Speaker to allow a secret ballot vote on the proposed motion. What seems to have necessitated the EFF’s request is the Hawks’ raiding of Mahumapelo’ offices on Thursday morning. Democratic Alliance provincial leader Joe Macgluwa says, “We would like to make it clear as the Democratic Alliance that should this motion be tabled, we are very eager. We are very excited to participate in this motion and yes of course as the DA in terms of what is happening in the North West province we will most definitely support such a motion. Because to us is about the elephant in the room and that is not only the Premier of this province but also the ANC itself.” Click below for more…  About Patrick Dintwa View all posts by Patrick Dintwa
