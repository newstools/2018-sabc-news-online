The Umkhonto we Sizwe Military Veterans Association (MKMVA) has expressed reservations about the country’s justice system. In a statement on Saturday, the MKMVA said it was unlikely that former president Jacob Zuma will get a fair trial in South Africa.  Former president Jacob Zuma’s legal representative is considering taking on review, the decision by the National Prosecuting Agency to reinstate corruption charges against him. NPA director, Shaun Abrahams announced on Friday that Zuma will be prosecuted on charges of corruption, money laundering and racketeering. Zuma’s lawyer, Michael Hulley says following a careful consideration on the matter, he feels the reason for the decision is not clear as the rationale behind it is not clearly outlined in the communication furnished to him as the legal representative of Zuma. He says while it appears if the likely cause of action will be to take Abrahams’ decision on review, it will only be done after careful consideration and consultation with his client. The charges against Zuma was dropped by the former acting director of the NPA Mokotedi Mpshe just before the 2009 elections in a decision that the Pretoria High Court found to be irrational in 2016.
