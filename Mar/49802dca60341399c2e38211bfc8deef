National Chairperson of the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) Dali Mpofu says there is “zero chance” that, party leader Julius Malema will ever go back to the African National Congress (ANC). This past weekend saw several leaders of the governing party, including veteran Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, Deputy President, David Mabuza and the president, Cyril Ramaphosa attempting to lure him back to the ANC. Malema has taken to Twitter and assured his party members that he will not go and re-join the confusion in the ANC. Mpofu has pointed out that they were both expelled from the ANC: “Julius Malema is on record as saying that he will never go back to the ANC, even myself as well. I mean, it would be absurd for us to go back to the ANC because the reasons still remain. And in the case of Julius and others, were expelled by the ANC. And you can’t just un-expel them in a TV interview.” Click below for more:  About Abongile Dumako View all posts by Abongile Dumako
