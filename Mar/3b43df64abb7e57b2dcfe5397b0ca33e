Democratic Alliance (DA) leader, Mmusi Maimane says the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) does not have solid grounds on which to remove Nelson Mandela bay mayor, Athol Trollip. He says Trollip’s race is the reason the EFF has given. Maimane is attending the council meeting in Port Elizabeth where the fate of Trollip will be debated. Meanwhile, the African National Congress (ANC), EFF and United Democratic Movement (UDM) members have gathered outside the city hall to demonstrating their unity against the DA. Earlier, a motion of no confidence in Trollip was disrupted, resulting in the Speaker, Jonathan Lawack, leaving the council chambers. Maimane attempted to intervene following the disruption. “It’s intolerance and corruption and chaos. See, people are intolerant. The law says this is a public institution, anybody can come. Tomorrow they will kick out more people. How can we allow in a democracy for this to continue?” “You should strongly condemn it because the constitution of the republic says every legislature must be transparent and open to the public. I am here as an interested citizen. Tomorrow they are going to kick out the media because they will say you disrupted them, or whatever the case may be,” adds Maimane.
