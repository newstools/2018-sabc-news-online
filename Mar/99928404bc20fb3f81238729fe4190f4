The African Parliamentarian Association for Human Rights (Afripahr) will be meeting in Parliament on Wednesday to hold its strategic planning session for the steering committee of network of parliamentarians. It will be the first time that the association holds the event in South Africa. Parliamentarians and political leaders from Thailand, US, UK, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Malawi, DRC and South Africa are expected to attend the event held for the first time in the country. Afripahr Chairperson Nqabayomzi Kwankwa says the event is held in South Africa in honour of the two former Presidents Nelson Mandela and Thabo Mbeki. Kwankwa says, “Our colleagues from the US and the UK felt that because this is the year of Nelson Mandela, we should hold our strategic planning session here is South Africa on Human Rights Day, in honour of former President Nelson Mandela. And those from other African countries in particular felt that because this programme has a Pan Africanist agenda that it should also be held in South Africa in honour of former President Thabo Mbeki who was working throughout his life to ensure that there is a Renaissance of Africa…” “We will be discussing what role as parliamentarian we can play in trying to advance the course of democracy, democratic principle and human rights in Africa, he added.
