North West African National Congress (ANC) Deputy Chairperson Sello Lehari says his party’s provincial executive committee, still has confidence in Supra Mahumapelo as both the chairperson and the premier. Lehari’s comments come as pressure is mounting for Mahumapelo to step down. Mahumapelo has been under fire since reports of fraud and corruption within some provincial government department. ANC Deputy Chairperson Sello Lehari says, “The ANC still support Mr Mahumapelo as the premier and as the chairperson. We have never sat in a meeting where we discussed the removal of the premier.” “Those people who are complaining about the premier let them come to the ANC and engage but I can tell you Mr Mahumapelo is still the premier and the chairperson of the ANC,” adds Lehari. Lehari says the call for Mahumapelo to be removed is politically motivated by those who are lazy to work hard to be elected during conferences. “There are some people in the province, they don’t want to be elected or they don’t want to work for positions they want to be put in positions. Now by causing these disruptions, this sensation and this confusion they think the NEC will automatically say there is a crisis in North West. Therefore let’s disband the PEC and put a new structure and this thing happened in 2009.” “The same people who were disbanded in 2009 after two years they were re-elected again. Remember by that time comrade Mahumapelo was the secretary he was now elevated and elected as the chairperson,” explains Lehari.
