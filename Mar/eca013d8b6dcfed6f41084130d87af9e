Ekurhuleni MMC for Transport Petrus Mabunda has condemned the violence by minibus taxi drivers on Gatuengâ€™s East Rand. Taxi drivers are on strike in Ekurhuleni over delays in the completion of the Harambee Bus Rapid Transit system. They are also demanding the resignation of Ekurhuleni Mayor Mzwandile Masina. The taxi drivers are forcing commuters out of privately-owned vehicles in the Kempton Park CBD. They insist that no one is allowed to transport commuters on their routes.
Mabunda says in their negotiations with taxi association management it was agreed that there would be no violence.   About SABC View all posts by SABC
