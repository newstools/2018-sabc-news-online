The Independent Electoral Commission deputy chairperson says the over 22 000 voting stations across the country have been opened on time. He was speaking to the SABC outside a voting station in Soweto where President Cyril Ramaphosa is expected to check his registration details. Tselane says the voter registration drive is running smoothly except in Vuwani, Limpopo, where residients are still protesting against the incorporation of their area in another municipality.
