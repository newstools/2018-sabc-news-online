A 37-year-old man accused of raping an eight-year-old girl in the Ratanda informal settlement on Gauteng’s East Rand will appear in court Monday. The suspect was arrested after the child told her grandmother about the incident. According to the police’s Thivulawi Tshilae, the grandmother immediately reported the matter to the police. “It happened on the Thursday afternoon while the child was coming from school. The suspect was in his house when he saw the victim passing by and he called her into the house and on arrival into the house he closed the door and undressed her and raped her. Later in the afternoon he was spotted walking on the street and then Ratanda police affected an arrest. He will appear before Heidelberg Magistrates Court tomorrow morning.” About Jamaine Krige View all posts by Jamaine Krige
