Author, Jacques Pauw says he is not surprised by the suspension of South African Revenue Service (SARS) Commissioner, Tom Moyane. Moyane’s suspension follows a meeting in which President Cyril Ramaphosa informed him that he had lost confidence in his ability to lead SARS and offered him an opportunity to resign with immediate effect, which Moyane declined. Some of the concern that was raised against Moyane was the management of VAT refunds, which had brought the SARS into serious disrepute and potentially jeopardised the integrity of the SARS as collector of revenue and adversely affected tax morality among tax payers. The Treasury has announced that Mark Kingon has been appointed as Acting SARS  Commissioner following the suspension of Moyane, pending a disciplinary hearing. Pauw says, “Moyane was on President Ramaphosa’s hit list, he was appointed back in 2014 by Jacob Zuma without having any tax experience. He was a Zuma loyalist and he stopped tax investigation into Zuma and Guptas. He disbanded all five investigation units at Sars leaving tax services toothless, he failed to collect tax of some very notorious criminals. So Moyane had to go quickly.”
