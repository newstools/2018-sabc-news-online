Cape Town Mayor Patricia de Lille’s legal team is to ask retired Democratic Alliance (DA) politician Sheila Camerer to recuse herself from the party’s panel that will conduct de Lille’s disciplinary hearing. Camerer, a law graduate and former attorney, was a Deputy Minister in the last National Party cabinet under former president FW De Klerk up to 1994. She was a DA member of Parliament up to 2009 and then served as ambassador to Bulgaria until her retirement in 2013. De Lille has asked the DA for an independent and impartial person in her disciplinary hearing, which will start on Tuesday. She objects to Camerer and the other two members of the DA panel. In a statement, De Lille says the hearing will be chaired by a DA councillor from Tlokwe in the North West, Hans-Jurie Moolman, a friend of his and fellow councillor, Pogisho Monchusi and former Deputy Justice Minister in the apartheid government, Camerer. De Lille says Camerer is neither competent nor suitable to hear the matter as she has not practiced law in decades. She says she will appear at the hearing on Tuesday and is looking foward to the proper testing of the allegations againt her. De Lille has been accused of maladministration and corruption in the City of Cape Town.   About Lyndon Khan View all posts by Lyndon Khan
