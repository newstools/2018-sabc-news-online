A council meeting in the Nelson Mandela Bay Metro (NMB) is now in session following scuffles between members of some political parties. Earlier, a motion of no-confidence debate in the NMB executive mayor Athol Trollip was disrupted, resulting in the Speaker, Jonathan Lawack, leaving the council chambers. Lawack now says the proceedings will be that of an ordinary council meeting. Trollip faces a second motion of no confidence since taking the Democratic Alliance (DA) took over from the African National Congress (ANC) after the local government elections. The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) has vowed to remove Trollip after the DA emphasized that it would not support land expropriation without compensation. DA Leader, Mmusi Maimane, left the chambers after trying to intervene in the earlier scuffles… “It’s intolerance and corruption and chaos. See, people are intolerant. The law says this is a public institution, anybody can come. Tomorrow they will kick out more people. How can we allow in a democracy for this to continue? You should strongly condemn it because the constitution of the republic says every legislature must be transparent and open to the public. I am here as an interested citizen. Tomorrow they are going to kick out the media because they will say you disrupted them, or whatever the case may be.” Click below to watch related videos:    About SABC View all posts by SABC
