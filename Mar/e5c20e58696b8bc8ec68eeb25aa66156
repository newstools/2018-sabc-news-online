Twelve British tourists including two children have been robbed in Mpumalanga. Three were injured while all were robbed of their belongings on the N17 near Ermelo, on Thursday night. The group stopped on the N17 near Ermelo en route to the Swaziland border. Three were badly hurt in the attack and rushed to hospital. They have since been discharged. Tourism officials are incensed. Emerlo Business Chamber’s Athol Stark says those who were attacked are traumatised. “Last night it was worse, we have debriefed them but we managed to act prompt and arranged accommodation for them.” Police are investigating. “We managed to recover the car keys this morning; we are pleading with motorists not to stop in dark areas because this area they stopped at is very dark. The robber managed to take most of their belongings including cash, passports,” says Mpumalanga SAPS Brigadier Leonard Hlathi. The group was heading for Swaziland on a film assignment for a children’s programme in London. The group declined to speak to the SABC.
