The Democratic Alliance (DA) says it will accept nothing less than reinstating the charges against former president Jacob Zuma. The party says it is keenly awaiting National Director of Public Prosecution (NDPP), Shaun Abrahams‘ decision on the matter. On Wednesday, Abrahams told Parliament that he was ready to make a decision on the matter, but would first inform Zuma before making it public. DA spokesperson on Justice, Glennis Breytenbach, says the NPA has run out of delaying tactics on the matter which they have been fighting for over nine years. “This matter comes from 2009 already. The NPA has confirmed that all their witnesses are available to testify and that they are ready to proceed and the decision is now in the hands of Shaun Abrahams. I think that if he decides not to prosecute he could very well see a lot more action being taken by the opposition parties such as the DA and the EFF. But if he does decide to prosecute him then let the previous president have his day in court. He has from the outset said he is innocent on these charges and that he would like to prove his innocence so I think the time has come for him to put his money where his mouth is,” explains legal analyst, Ulrich Roux.
