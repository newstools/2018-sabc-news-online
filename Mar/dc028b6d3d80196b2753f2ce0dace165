President Cyril Ramaphosa will on Tuesday launch a youth employment service aimed at empowering unemployed young South Africans. The three-year programme will ensure that young people gain work experience through job placement. The launch will take place at the Riversands Incubation Hub in Diepsloot, north of Johannesburg. Fedusa’s general secretary Dennis George says the labour federation will ensure the initiative succeeds. “Fedusa will sit on the steering committee, where we will ensure companies that take this young are going to make sure that they get the benefit on the job training but also important to drive the process forward. We will make sure the process covers the entire country, workers from different sectors and that is something that is very critical and special.” About Tshepo Mongoai View all posts by Tshepo Mongoai
