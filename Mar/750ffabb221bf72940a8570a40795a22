The Nepad Southern Africa Network for Biosciences’ Acceleration Programme titled “The FemBioBiz” returns for its second round after the first one attracted over 156 applications from nine countries in SADC. FemBioBiz is created to develop leadership, technological and business skills in female-owned businesses in the SADC region. BioFISA Programme Manager Zvikomborero Tangawamira says they created the programme when they realised that there are a lot of women doing activities and businesses in Bioscience and in most cases are not profiled. “We find that it is about 26% of women in Bio-businesses that are leading companies. So we are saying in Africa we need to take a step forward and showcase what good work women are doing. By doing that we allow young girl children to actually see what the potential could be in the Biosciences space.” Click below to watch full interview:   About Morning Live View all posts by Morning Live
