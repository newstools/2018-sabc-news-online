The bail hearing of seven men including a police officer suspected of being involved in the Glebelands Hostel killings at Umlazi, south of Durban are expected back in court from Monday until Thursday. The men are facing multiple charges including murder, attempted murder and possession of illegal firearms and ammunition. They were arrested in December last year at various locations by the KwaZulu-Natal provincial task team. Over the weekend, police also arrested another 29 year old suspect who is believed to be a hitman at the Glebelands Hostel.   About Fanele Mhlongo View all posts by Fanele Mhlongo
