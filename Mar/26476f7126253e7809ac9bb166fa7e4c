Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) boss Robert McBride is expected to appear in the Pretoria Magistrate’s Court on Tuesday, facing a charge of contravening provisions of the Children’s Act. McBride’s 15-year-old daughter claims he beat her and strangled her. He was granted R10 000 bail with the condition that he does not contact any witnesses. On February 27, McBride made a u-turn and abandoned his initial plan to make representations as to why he should not be prosecuted for child abuse. At the time, Magistrate Ignatius du Preez transferred the matter to the regional court where McBride will stand trial. One of McBride’s daughters is expected to be a defence witness during the trial. The court heard that she has already submitted her statement. In November, McBride’s bail conditions were amended so that he could see and speak to one his daughters, who will be testifying. He was previously released on bail of R10 000, on the condition that he did not contact any of the witnesses, which included the daughter he allegedly assaulted and the younger daughter, who he is now able to see. The charges are related to an incident that allegedly took place while McBride and one of his daughters were driving in a car. His teenage daughter claimed he beat and strangled her. According to reports, she said that the alleged assault was not an isolated incident and it “happened all the time”. However, McBride has denied the allegations “I admit that I admonished one of my daughters, whom I love very much,” said McBride. He explained that he had become concerned about his daughter’s school marks and “somewhat rebellious” behaviour, and had admonished her, but never assaulted her.
