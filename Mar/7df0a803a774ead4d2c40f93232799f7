The State is expected to call its third witness to testify in the murder trial of two men accused of killing of a 15-year-old Matlhomola Mosweu, from Coligny in the North West. The accused, Pieter Doorewaard and Phillip Schutte, allegedly killed Mosweu last year in April after accusing him of stealing sunflower. It is alleged that after assaulting Mosweu, they pushed him away from a moving bakkie, andÂ  he sustained serious injuries that caused his death. Their trial which started on Tuesday at the North West High Court in Mahikeng, has been set aside until next Friday. About 21 state witnesses are expected to testify.
