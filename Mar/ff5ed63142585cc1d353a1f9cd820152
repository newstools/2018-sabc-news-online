The murder trial of Sandile Mantsoe who is accused of killing his girlfriend Karabo Mokoena has been postponed to next month in the High court in Johannesburg. The then 22-year-old Mokoena’s charred remains were found in a veld in Lyndhurst north of Johannesburg in April last year. Mantsoe, a married father of three, has denied killing Mokoena. Wearing a navy blue blazer with white shirt, Mantsoe briefly appeared in court before his case was postponed to the 16th of April. The State has told the court that they still need to finalise the new evidence that has emerged, and that the experts they need to consult with are in Durban, and testifying on another matter. The court has instructed the state to also give the defense the new evidence in order to be able to be ready when the trial starts. The trial has been set for three weeks from that date.
