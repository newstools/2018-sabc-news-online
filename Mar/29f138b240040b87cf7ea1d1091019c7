The Gupta brothers are appearing before tax authorities in India on Monday in an on-going probe against them. The brothers were summoned by Indian tax officials earlier this month and given time until March 26th to make an appearance. After having missed one summons, already, the Gupta brothers have until the end of Monday to make an appearance before Indian tax officials. They were first summoned by officials on March 16, but on that day the Guptas did not come themselves but sent their Chartered Account in their place. Gupta residences and properties in India were raided by tax officials in early March. During the raid, several documents were seized which reportedly revealed transactions worth millions of dollars. The documents also revealed how the brothers allegedly have 120 properties across India. The brothers have been summoned to explain these transactions. Investigators had also found around 300 blank but signed cheques of private banks in Dehradun and Saharanpur from Gupta properties. The charges that are allegedly being probed are of alleged money laundering and that of fraudulently amassing properties in Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh and the Delhi capital region. Officials in India claim they have ‘attached’ about 31 properties of the Guptas, implying these properties are being looked at as suspect. This is the norm in the course of an income tax investigation. About SABC Radio View all posts by SABC Radio
