The South African Federation of Trade Unions (Saftu) is set to lead a march in Johannesburg against proposed new labour law amendments. The union says the march is against a proposed amendments affecting workers’ right to strike and the minimum wage. The march is set to start at Mary Fitzgerald Square in Newtown to the Labour Department in Braamfontein. Saftu spokesperson Patrick Craven says they will take legal action if necessary, and are prepared to go as far as the Constitutional Court. Craven says, “The amendments were agreed by Nedlac, scandalously involving the leaders of certain trade unions who have signed a deal which we believe makes it virtually impossible for workers to organise a strike.” “They will in effect become virtual slaves. It will also raise the issue of wages, and we believe the proposed minimum wage, which is also going to be introduced on the 1st of May of R20 an hour, even less for certain category of workers is absolutely unacceptable,” he added.
