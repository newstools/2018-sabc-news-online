Two top Ugandan immigration officials have been interdicted by President Yoweri Museveni, and are being investigated over allegations of corruption and embezzlement. The director for Citizenship and Immigration, Godfrey Sasaga, and the Commissioner for Immigration, Anthony Namara, have also been under secret investigation by government spy agencies as well as the Ombudsman, Ugandaâ€™s Daily Monitor reported on Friday. Museveni has also directed the Criminal Investigations Directorate to investigate whether the officials were complicit in alleged mishandling of visa fees, irregular issuance of passports and other work permits. At the conclusion of investigations there is chance that the two men will face criminal charges if the claims against them are credible. The immediate trigger of the interdiction was the questionable handling of the UGX13 billion e-passports contract (R41.5 million), and followed a protest to the president by a close associate of the first family.
