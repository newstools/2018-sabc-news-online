The African National Congress (ANC) interim leadership in KwaZulu-Natal has distanced itself from what it refers to as fake reports circulating on social media. The reports say party provincial coordinator Sihle Zikalala has been calling on people to come out in their numbers to support former President Jacob Zuma when he appears in court next week. The ANC leadership in the province says Zikalala has never mobilised members to go to court to support the former President. The provincial leadership says it will abide by the partyâ€™s National Executive Committee (NEC) decision that no member may use party regalia when going to the court and that if members choose to go to court they may do so in their personal capacity.
