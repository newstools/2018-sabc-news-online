The South African Weather Service has warned of possible floods in KwaZulu-Natal, where there’s been heavy rain since early Thursday morning. With rain expected in much of the north-east of the country, Gauteng has sent disaster management teams to informal settlements in and around Johannesburg. Weather Service spokesperson Wiseman Dlamini says it will continue to rain until the weekend. “We are having widespread showers in most parts of KZN. We are expecting this rainfall to continue for the rest of the day into the evening. These conditions are expected to be the same or similar even tomorrow (Friday) especially in the morning. We are also going for 80% probability in most parts of KZN tomorrow. We have got a warning out for heavy rains which might lead to flooding in the midlands, western parts of KZN, coastal areas as well as southern parts of KZN.” About Khalesakhe Mbhense View all posts by Khalesakhe Mbhense
