Two suspects who are members of the controversial Mancoba Seven Angel’s Ministries church in Ngcobo are expected to appear in the Mzimkhulu Magistrate’s court in the Eastern Cape. They are facing two counts of murder for Ndumiso Jali and his wife Nomaindia that took place at their house earlier this year, who were former leaders of the Crusaders Church. It’s alleged the attackers also made off with a large sum of money. There were links between the Jalis and the Mancobas. The breakthrough in this separate murder case happened during the investigation into the Ngcobo police station attack. Meanwhile, one of leaders of the Seven Angels Ministries will today also appear in the Ngcobo Magistrate’s court for alleged sexual crimes that took place in the church. Since the attack on the police station last month, the police have already instituted improvements at the station. Additional personnel have also been deployed to improve the service to the public.
