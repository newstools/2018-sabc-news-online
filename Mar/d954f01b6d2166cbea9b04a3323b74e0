The Independent Police Investigative Directorate (IPID) says it has a strong case against former acting National Police Commissioner Khomotso Phahlane. Phahlane and his two co-accused are charged with six charges of corruption. They appeared briefly in the Pretoria Specialized Commercial Crimes court on Monday, where the case was postponed. The case relates to the construction of Phahlane’s multimillion-rand home and his fleet of luxury cars. IPID Spokesperson Moses Dlamini says, “Once the exchange of documents has concluded, then we will be in a position to add more suspects to the dock. Yes there is a possibility that more will be added… The fact that the docket has been disclosed to the accused means that the investigation has been concluded and that we are ready to proceed to trial. So we believe we’ve got a strong case and that is our stand point.”     About Maluti Obuseng View all posts by Maluti Obuseng
