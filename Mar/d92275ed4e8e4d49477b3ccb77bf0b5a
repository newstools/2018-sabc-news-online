The Hawks have indicated that they know where the Gupta brothers are, but would not reveal the whereabouts of the brothers. Hawks spokesperson Hangwani Mulaudzi says, “We continue to monitor their movement… we are doing the best that we can, in terms of making sure that we follow their movement everywhere. At the same time there is a lot of behind the scenes issues that we are dealing with, with Interpol.” “The last time we spoke, we spoke about Estina only. There are issues of Eskom, there are issues of Prasa, there are issues of Denel,” added Mulaudzi. Last month, the Hawks issued a warrant of arrest for Ajay Gupta in connection to the failed multi-million Rand Estina Dairy Farm Project in the Free State. The Gupta brothers have subsequently failed to appear before Parliament’s inquiry into corporate governance at Eskom. The family is also facing citizenship disputes between India and South Africa. They recently released a statement saying that the Gupta brothers are in fact not Indian, but are South African citizens.
