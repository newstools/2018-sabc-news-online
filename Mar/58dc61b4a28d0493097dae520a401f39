A 32-year-old man is expected to be sentenced by the Pietermaritzburg High court for the murder of his four nephews. Ben Mbhele pleaded guilty to killing the four children aged between four and 12 at the KwaNzimakwe area near Port Sheptstone on the KwaZulu-Natal south coast in September last year. Mbhele pleaded guilty to all four counts of murder. The children were watching television on the day of the attack on the 1st of September last year. Their mother S’lindile Mbhele had visited friends leaving the children alone at home. Unbeknown to the mother, this was the last day she would see her children alive. Family spokesperson Nkosinathi Mbhele welcomed the guilty plea. However, he says it must also be revealed where the missing body parts of the children are. The children’s ears had been cut off. He believes they were meant to be used for muthi.  About Cyril Mnguni View all posts by Cyril Mnguni
