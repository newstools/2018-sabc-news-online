The Portfolio Committee on Agriculture says it is concerned about the spread of the H5N8 avian flu to African penguins along the coast of the Western Cape, especially at Boulders Beach as the African Penguins are an endangered species. The Committee says it is now awaiting a response from the Department of Agriculture following a statement by an avian veterinarian claiming that avian flu and listeriosis may be attributed to the low quality of grain that is being fed to birds which affects their immune system. Committee Chairperson Rosina Machwene Semenya says the Department must continue to monitor bird populations and testing on sick birds and carcasses must be done regularly as bird colonies are at risk. She has also warned the public that cross contamination occurs when people are not in the habit of disinfecting or washing their hands after touching raw meat. She has urged the public not to touch dead birds. Semenya says the public must also be vigilant and report the deaths of groups of wild birds to the nearest state veterinarian.
