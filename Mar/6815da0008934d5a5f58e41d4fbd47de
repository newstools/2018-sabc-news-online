As the country marks national water week Kimberley in the Northern Cape is experiencing a three-day water shutdown. The Sol Plaatje Municipality has shut down water yet again for a major water upgrade to the city’s network. Schools and several government departments are also closed. Water points have been established for the recent upgrade to keep the impact minimal as possible. Medical facilities say they have made necessary arrangements and operations will continue as normal. Gariep Mediclinic’s Stephan Deetlefs says, “We have got a tank of 120 000 litres of water. We bought a lot of five litre bottles of water as well, especially for our patients, and ice, for the normal day to day, to make sure that they have drinkable water. Our theatres we recycle auto clothe water, so our theatres can continue working normally.”  WATCH RELATED VIDEO BELOW:    About Reginald Witbooi View all posts by Reginald Witbooi
