The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF)  in Nelson Mandela Bay Metro in the Eastern Cape has tabled a motion of no confidence in Executive Mayor, Athol Trollip. The party says they are fed up with the alleged arrogance of Trollip who they claim has ignored their request to prioritise the development of poor communities and insourcing of security guards. It says the DA’s rejection of its land expropriation without compensation motion is not the only reason why they have tabled the motion. The party’s Provincial coordinator is Yazini Thetyana says the EFF has met with Trollip on issues that are related to budget. “We have tabled budgetary things that we think will help the development of Nelson Mandela Bay, particularly people in Zwide, Motherwell, people in the northern suburbs and all those things were raised of development and were never taken into consideration when the budget was tabled.” “We have consistently said to the DA in Nelson Mandela that one day these things that you are rejecting coming from the EFF while we continuously vote for you will one day come back,” adds Thetyana.
