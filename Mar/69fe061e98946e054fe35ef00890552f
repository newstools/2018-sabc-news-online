Two SACP Nelson Mandela Bay Regional leaders, Andile Mfunda and Msingathi Siphuka, have emerged as the frontrunners for the mayoral candidate position for the ANC in the Nelson Mandela Bay, if the EFF’s motion of no confidence against the incumbent Mayor DA’s Athol Trollip is successful. The EFF has tabled a motion of no confidence against Trollip to be debated in the Council Meeting next Thursday. The EFF, which has six seats in council, says it will only vote with the ANC in the motion if it brings former Deputy Finance Minister Mcebisi Jonas or someone who is incorruptible like him as its mayoral candidate. According to sources, Jonas has declined the offer leaving the contestation to Mfunda and Siphuka. With eight days left before the much-anticipated council meeting, the Regional Executive Committee needs to submit a name for consideration to the PEC. But according to inside sources, the REC is divided between the two names. Mfunda is currently a PR Councillor for the ANC, Chairperson for the SACP in the region. He’s a former Political Head for Human Settlement and Infrastructure and Engineering. He was a councillor for Ward 30 for 10 years. While Msingathi Siphuka is currently an advisor for the United Nations office in SA, a former Regional Chairperson for the SACP and Deputy Director for Monitoring and Evaluation in the Municipality, and has experience in the corporate sector. Both Mfunda and Siphuka say they haven’t been approached for the position. About SABC View all posts by SABC
