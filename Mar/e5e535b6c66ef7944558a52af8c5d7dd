Teachers union South African Democratic Teachers’ Union (Sadtu) has added its voice to the increasing number of organisations including all African National Congress (ANC) alliance partners, to call for North West Premier Supra Mahumapelo to resign. The union’s PEC, which has been a strong-backer of Mahumapelo, has resolved to call for his resignation, citing allegations of corruption and fraud at his office and other provincial departments. This follows leaked invoices amounting to over R200 million that were allegedly paid to an ICT company. Furthermore revelations of alleged corruption with a Gupta linked company, in the awarding of tenders at the Health Department made headlines. Sadtu’s provincial secretary, Elf Themba says Mahumapelo is compromised. “The recent raid by the Hawks at the Office of the Premier, looking at the political turmoil in the province, and the by federations in the province our view is that indeed that he must resign. We think the Premier must do an honourable thing and step down. We noted that that particular office is compromised. Indeed there are serious issues that need to be looked into at that office,” says Themba.  Click below for a related video:   About Lucas Mothibedi View all posts by Lucas Mothibedi
