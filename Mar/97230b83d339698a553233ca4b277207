Students at the University of Venda in Limpopo continue to leave the Thohoyandou campus after management decided to close it until next week. The closureÂ followed a week of violent protest by students who were barricading streets with burning tyres. Police had to use rubber bullets to disperse them. Students were demanding payments of National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) grants and food and books allowances. In a new development, students at the nearby Vhembe FET Makwarela campus went on the rampage last night after three students were allegedly knocked down by a speeding vehicle. They were all rushed to hospital. The students are demanding construction of effective speed humps which will cause motorists to slow down when approaching the campus. Several accidents wherein students were hit by speeding vehicles in the area happened in the past.  About Rudzani Tshivhase View all posts by Rudzani Tshivhase
