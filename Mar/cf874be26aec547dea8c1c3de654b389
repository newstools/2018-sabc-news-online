The Food and Workers Union (Fawu) has called on Health Minister, Aaron Motsoaledi to clarify his public statement relating to Listeriosis. The Union says the Minister needs to make it clear that not all ready-to-eat meat is affected by the Listeria outbreak. Fawu says thousands of jobs could be lost as consumers have largely stopped buying these products, even from companies that have not been blamed for the outbreak. Fawu General Secretary, Katishi Masemola says a distinction was not made between ready-to-eat meat that is produced by role players other than Enterprise. He says: “We are worried that thousands of jobs will be at stake.” “The market will be taken over by illegal operators, including illegal dumpers of chicken and by the illicit traders. The Minister must quickly and publicly clarify to the nation before it is too late,” adds Masemola. About Ditaba Tsotetsi View all posts by Ditaba Tsotetsi
