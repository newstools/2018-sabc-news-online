Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba has denied ever interfering with either the appointments of board members or the procurement processes of State-Owned Enterprises. Gigaba, who is a former Minister of Public Enterprises, appeared before the Parliamentary inquiry investigating allegations of State Capture at Eskom. Meanwhile, it’s highly unlikely the inquiry will have the opportunity to hear from former South African Airways (SAA) board chairperson, Dudu Myeni or any of the Gupta brothers this week, after they once again informed MPs of their unavailability. It’s been a tough few days for the Home Affairs Minister. His appearance before the Inquiry, where he was interrogated on state capture allegations during his tenure at Public Enterprises between November 2010 and May 2014, would prove no different. In his 25 page submission however Gigaba denied any knowledge of wrongdoing, either by himself or individuals he had appointed to various boards of directors. Meanwhile, it remains unclear when Myeni and the Gupta brothers will appear before the inquiry. Myeni, who has accused MPs of treating her like a criminal, says she’s still unable to fly due to illness. And the Guptas’ lawyer informed the Parliament that none of the brothers are in the country.   About Aasra Bramdeo View all posts by Aasra Bramdeo
