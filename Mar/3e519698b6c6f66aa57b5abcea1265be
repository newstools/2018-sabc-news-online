There’s chaos in the Nelson Mandela Bay Metro council where a motion of a vote of no confidence in executive mayor Athol Trollip is about to get under way. Earlier the former deputy mayor of the Metro and United Democratic Movement(UDM) councillor, Mongameli Bobani, said he believed ‘a surprise move’ is awaiting Democratic Alliance(DA) mayor, Athol Trollip in Thursday morning’s motion of confidence debate. Bobani, who was once a coalition partner in the DA-led coalition government, says the Patriotic Alliance’s(PA) support for Trollip may not necessarily guarantee his safety once the voting his finalised. Trollip faces his second motion of no confidence since taking the DA took over from the African Independent Congress after the local government elections. The PA and the African Independent Congress have decided to side with the DA while the ANC is reluctant to support the Economic Freedom Fighters(EFF) which initiated the motion of no confidence in Trollip. Bobani says the UDM doesn’t have any personal grudge and are not about positions. He says: “For us to support the motion to remove him, it’s not about being personal. Remember with the corrupt DA and Athol Trollip in this municipality, the UDM has exposed them. We even went and opened charges against Trollip for his corruption against some of the things that are happening.” “As the UDM we are not saying we are removing Trollip because of personalities, it is because of corruption,” says Bobani.
