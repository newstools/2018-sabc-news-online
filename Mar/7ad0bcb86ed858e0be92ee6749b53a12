Dozens of politicians, union members and locals have attended the funeral of the late African National Congress (ANC) MP Fezeka Loliwe at her home in Frankfort outside Bhisho in the Eastern Cape. The mourners include Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly Lechesa Tsenoli, ANC Chief Whip Jackson Mthembu, Transport Minister Blade Nzimande and Eastern Cape ANC Chairman Oscar Mabuyance. She died in a car crash on the R63 road near Alice a week ago en route to her parliamentary constituency in Fort Beaufort. Loliwe was a teacher by profession and held a Masterâ€™s Degree in Education and Labour Law. She served in the various structures in the ANC led Tripartite Alliance. Her activism dates back to her high school years when she led the student movement, Cosas. She joined the liberation struggle at a young age, served as South African Democratic Teachers Union (Sadtu) vice-president and as South African Communist Party (SACP) central committee member. Her colleagues have described her as a scholar and a selfless leader. She died at the age of 54-years and was serving as the Whip of the ANC Caucus Disciplinary Committee.
