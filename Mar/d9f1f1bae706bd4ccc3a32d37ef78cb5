Two suspects charged with malicious damage to property, burglary and theft are expected to appear in the Molopo Magistrateâ€™s Court in the North West. This follows an incident in which ANC members allegedly forced entry into a meeting in Mahikeng last month. Theodolus Nebe and Jabulani Ngobelanga allegedly disrupted the meeting which the Save North West Campaign had convened in Ratshidi hall. The campaign says its objective is to expose corruption in the provincial government. It is alleged that a group believed to be supporters of Premier Supra Mahumapelo disrupted the meeting and caused damage to property. Police are investigating a case of attempted murder, two of malicious damage to property and burglary to businesses following an incident in which people forced entry into the hall where the meeting was being held. One 31 year old male was allegedly shot at while a vehicle and chairs were damaged during the violent action. During the first appearance of the accused police had to restrain the audience from disrupting the proceedings at the Molopo court room. This was as rival groups of those in support of the accused were confronting members of the Save North West Campaign.   About SABC Radio View all posts by SABC Radio
