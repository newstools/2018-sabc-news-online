KwaZulu-Natal emergency services are on standby as temperatures are expected to drop, with a cold-front being experienced over most parts of the country. Forecasters expect downpours over the extreme southern regions of the province, spreading northwards from Friday. The provincial Department of Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs has urged residents to be extremely cautious, especially when travelling. “Temperatures are expected to drop to below normal levels. We have all our disaster teams ready to be able to assist. They have all been notified of the situation that is pending. We urge people to minimise their movement and travelling if it’s raining heavily on the road.  The road itself becomes waterlogged and it becomes a source of major tragedy. It’s important to know that if you are in an area that is prone to flooding, don’t take it for granted, try and move to a safer area.” About SABC View all posts by SABC
