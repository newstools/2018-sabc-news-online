African National Congress (ANC) General Secretary Ace Magashule says the ANC wants a prosperous South Africa for all. He was addressing the provincial Human Rights rally at Kaizer Sebothelo stadium in Botshabelo east of Bloemfontein. He says this can only be achieved when the land is returned to the people and the wealth of the country is shared. Magashule says 2018 is an important year as the party is celebrating a centenary for former president Nelson Mandela and Albertina Sisulu. He says 2018 is a year of unity, renewal, reconnecting with our history and the year of focusing on the future, a better future, prosperous for all the people of South Africa. “South-Africa with no white or black but a South-Africa with human beings.” “That is why we want as the ANC to reconnect the public of South Africa, to reconnect with the organisation it self and make sure we walk the talk of unity,” says Magashule.
