The Commission for Gender Equality has strongly condemned the attack of a female train driver by some commuters. They stripped her naked, hit her with a brick and dragged her into bushes during on-going attacks on trains along the Pretoria to Pienarspoort corridor last Tuesday. The commuters had complained about train delays before the attack. The Commission says no amount of provocation warrants the attack of a defenceless woman. It has called on the commuters who were on the train on the day in question to work with police in identifying the perpetrators. “We believe this barbaric act has to be nip in the butt. Police have to do the necessary to send a strong (message) to society that train drivers regardless of the sex or gender cannot be assaulted in the manner that she has been assaulted,” says the Commission’s spokesperson, Javu Baloyi.
