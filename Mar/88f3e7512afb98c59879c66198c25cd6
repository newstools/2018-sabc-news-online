Three children died and a woman sustained serious burn wounds in a shack fire in the Enkanini informal settlement in Khayelitsha on the Cape Flats. Fire spokesperson Theo Layne said, “We had one informal structure that was destroyed by fire. It left two female minors and one male minor with fatal burns. In addition to this, one adult female sustained 50 percent burns and was treated on the scene by the city’s Fire and Rescue Service medics and transported to hospital…” Layne said the cause of the fire is still unknown.
