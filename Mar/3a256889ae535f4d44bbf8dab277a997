The University of South Africa has suspended two staff members after a female employee from the Centre for Early Childhood Education reported sexual harassment. Gugulethu Ncube claims that in January a Board member approached her and demanded to have sex with her in order to keep her job. Ncube says when she reported the matter to the centre’s Board Chair she was dismissed and the University’s Vice Chancellor said they do not get involved in the affairs of the centre. <a href="https://iono.fm/e/543794">Content hosted by iono.fm</a>  Unisa spokesperson Martin Ramotshela says one official has been suspended for sexual harassment and the other for alleged unwillingness to investigate the matter. However, with regards to Ncube’s dismissal, Ramotshela says he cannot confirm the issue as the centre is a separate legal entity. “Unisa is not involved in the matter between the employer and employee. We are aware of the matter around her services being terminated and there is a dispute around that. Our understanding is that the matter has been referred to the CCMA.”
