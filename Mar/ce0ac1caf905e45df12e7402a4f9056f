Transport Minister Blade Nzimande says he’s concerned about people driving while fatigued. This comes after at least 50 people died in a spate of crashes this Easter Weekend. Nzimande urged motorists to be more responsible and take regular breaks. In the most recent major crash, 15 people died when a taxi overturned near Greytown in KwaZulu Natal and, five people have been killed including four pedestrians and a driver of a bakkie at Mpophomeni outside Pietermaritzburg. Nzimande has expressed concern over the spike of fatal road crashes. “We are now aware as to what are the times that accidents most happen. The most dangerous time has been between 6 pm and 10 pm as well as early hours of the morning where there is an element of fatigue and people just drive on and on without taking a rest,” says Nzimande. “The other thing is the high number of pedestrians who die in road accidents. We have also identified the areas being mainly townships and areas that you have got a number of taverns operating  – we have lots of pedestrian fatalities there,” he added.
