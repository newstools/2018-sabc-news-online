Some residents in Vuwani Limpopo have vowed not to participate in this weekend’s voter registration drive by the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC).  This follows their unhappiness with the inclusion of their area in the new Collins Chabane Municipality. The IEC has however set out its voter registration stations outside some school gates. This after teachers locked up schools to prevent IEC staff from using them for the voter registration drive. Meanwhile, some electoral commission staff outside Avhatondwi Primary School expressed fear as there is no police presence. IEC Vice Chairperson Terry Tselane explains: “There may be some difficulties in the area of Vuwani but our officials are attending to that situation. Hopefully through the negotiations and interactions we have with the community leaders there, we will be allowed to operate after some time.”  About SABC Radio View all posts by SABC Radio
