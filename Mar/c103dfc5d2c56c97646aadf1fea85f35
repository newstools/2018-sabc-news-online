The community of Gopane village in North-West still reels in shock following the murder of a 75-year-old woman on Friday morning. The retired lecturer, Bonyana Nkgothoe was found by neighbours with a cut at the back of her head. Spokesperson for the newly formed gender based violence group Lehurutshe Rise, Moagi Moiloa, says the shocking incident adds up to the rising number of killings of the elderly and the raping of women. “Most of our elderly people are being attacked. This is not the first incident, this thing has been going on for years now. So, we intend to stand up as youth to actually come with a solution to keep our parents from being attacked.” Meanwhile, police have condemned the act of mob justice after one of Nkgothoe’s alleged attackers was forced to hang himself from a tree later during the day by an unknown group of members of the Gopane community.
