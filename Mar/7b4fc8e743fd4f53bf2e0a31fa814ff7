The Radebe family and Amadiba Crisis Committee (ACC) have accused the Hawks of stalling the investigation into the murder of Sikhosiphi ‘Bazooka’ Radebe. Radebe, who was the chairman of ACC, was shot and killed by unknown gunmen outside his home at Lurholweni in Mbizana Local Municipality in the Eastern Cape in 2016. The slain chairperson of ACC was in the forefront of preventing proposed titanium mining operations by an Australian-owned mining company MRC and its local subsidiary Transworld Energy Minerals (TEM) at Xolobeni in the Wild Coast. The lawyers of his family and organisation have written to the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) requesting them to intervene on their behalf. ACC member Sibusiso Mqadi says police are dragging their feet hence no one has been arrested. “It has been two years now since Bazooka has been murdered but the Hawks didn’t do any report back to the crisis committee or the Xolobeni people or the Amadiba people that  are supposed to be informed. That is why we are accusing that the Hawks are blocking the case,” said Mqadi. About SABC View all posts by SABC
