Education Activists have called on government to convene a School Safety Indaba to develop a safety charter for the well-being of learners. The call comes after a recent spate of incidents across the country where learners died on the school premises. In the Eastern Cape, a five-year-old girl, Lumka Mketwa fell into a pit toilet on the school premises. Another five-year-old girl died after being electrocuted in Limpopo. President Cyril Ramaphosa has urged Basic Education minister, Angie Motshekga to provide the state of school infrastructure within a month so that steps can be taken to fix problems. Education Activist, Hendrik Makaneta says, “We believe that the issue of safety in schools is long overdue. We appreciate the efforts that the government is taking particularly the intervention by President Cyril Ramaphosa. But we believe that president Ramaphosa should call all education stakeholders under the one roof so that we can put the matter of school safety to finality.” About Ditaba Tsotetsi View all posts by Ditaba Tsotetsi
