The death toll from the Listeriosis outbreak has reached 189. That is the latest confirmation by the National Institute of Communicable Diseases (NICD). Enterprise and Rainbow Chicken were singled out for testing positive to the strain that resulted in the outbreak. Their products have since been pulled off the shelves at retailers across the country. Lawyers are also contemplating a class action for the victims of the deadly food-borne bacteria. The NICD says 23 more cases of Listeriosis have been confirmed since the recall of affected products last month. Ten of them ate the affected foods, while two had direct contact with the bacteria. All exposures occurred prior to the recall. Head of the Centre for Enteric Diseases Dr Juno Thomas says more cases could still be reported, due to the bacteriaâ€™s incubation period of 70 days. A class action lawsuit has been filed against food company Tiger Brands following the outbreak.     About SABC View all posts by SABC
