Education technology firm Eiffel Corp will this year offer an accredited digital training programme for teachers wishing to add digital teaching competencies to their current skills. A study in 2011 found that less than 35% of South Africa’s teachers had been trained in basic digital and information and communication technology. Eiffel Corp, which is a leader in education technology across Africa, was accredited to offer the Digital Teaching and Learning Series Certification last year and will offer the programme from May. “The accreditation adds credibility to this international programme, which is applicable to all educators across the country, and the public courses will up-skill anyone who wishes to add digital teaching competencies to their current skills,” said Myles Thies, Director of Digital Learning Services. “The DTLS programme has met with the required academic criteria and aligns with recognized and relevant outcomes of the education department.” Thies said many educators in South Africa had strong academic experience and competency to teach, but are less confident teaching with technology. “As students engage with digital literacy via social media, they have the same expectations of their education experience. They want to learn using multi-media tools, that are available 24/7,” he said. About ANA View all posts by ANA
