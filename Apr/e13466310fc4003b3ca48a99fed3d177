The controversial Mediosa mobile clinic company that operates in the Free State and North-West has denied having any links with the Gupta family. The North West government has instituted investigations over allegations that the company has links with the Guptas. The company has also dismissed allegations that tender processes with the provincial Health were flawed. Mediosa Health Director, Inish Merchan has however admitted that they received a R30 million advance from government to start their business. “There is clause which says there would be R30 million in advance to be paid, and we received the 30 million in advance. And once that money was received, was used for other capital expenses like tax and to buy those equipment. We had already rendered services more that 30 million rand, in waste comparing to the amount of the department of health,” says Merchan.
