Five suspects connected to the taxi violence that has left about 60 people dead around Mthatha in the Eastern Cape are expected to appear in the Libode magistrateâ€™s court. They face charges including murder, possession of illegal firearm and ammunition. Police say the five suspects were arrested on the 26th of March with six firearms that include two R-5 rifles, an AK-47 and three pistols. Their arrest followed a shooting that took place near Maqanyeni village in which a minibus taxi with four male occupants was shot at. One of the occupants, a 37 year old, died instantly while three others sustained injuries. Police spokesperson Khaya Tonjeni says one of the suspects has since turned state witness. It is also reported that the suspects, some from Tongaat in KwaZulu-Natal and Cape Town will also face charges of possession of stolen vehicles that were allegedly used during the shooting. Mthatha commuters are still suffering from the violence as well as the taxi route closures that have impeded on the ability to travel for many.
