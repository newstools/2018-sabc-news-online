DA leader, Mmusi Maimane will visit the Wellington area in the Cape Winelands on Workers Day (1 May) to address farmworkers in that area. Maimane will be addressing the workers on what the DA calls, the successes of the farm equity share scheme model in the province. The schemes allow farmers the option to share their land through a share ownership scheme. Maimane’s spokesperson, Portia Adams says: “Those who work the land, we believe, should be able to have a share in it. On workers day we will celebrate the successful projects in the DA government where this ideal has been achieved.” “The leader will be joined by the DA Western Cape provincial leader, Bonginkosi Madikizela, the DA Western Cape deputy leader, Albert Fritz and the constituency head and west regional chairperson in that area.” About Lynne Arendse View all posts by Lynne Arendse
