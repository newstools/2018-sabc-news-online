The Hawks say they are still waiting for an official request from Parliament to assist in tracking down some witnesses. Parliament has sent a stern warning to former SAA Board chairperson, Dudu Myeni, the Gupta brothers and former President Jacob Zuma’s son, Duduzane, saying they can run but they can’t hide. On Wednesday, Parliament said it planned to ask law enforcement agencies such as the Hawks to help track down the witnesses. This was after they snubbed Parliament’s Portfolio Committee on Public Enterprises, which is currently investigating allegations of state capture at some state-owned enterprises. Meanwhile, ANC Youth League Deputy Secretary-General Thandi Moraka has called on the League’s President Collen Maine to resign. She has accused Maine of being an attention-seeker after Maine admitted that North West Premier Supra Mahumapelo was the one who introduced him to the Gupta Brothers. Maine made the admission during a memorial service for struggle icon Winnie Madikizela-Mandela in Potchefstroom in North-West on Thursday. Moraka says Maine has tainted the League’s reputation because he has reversed his stance from last year. At that time he had denied allegations that stated Mahumapelo introduced him to the Guptas. “Why is he saying it now? That’s the question which we are trying to understand, what kind of a leader is he? Because it means he’s a liar, a sell out. He misled the structure, he ridiculed the structure in the eyes of the public just for him to be defended.” Click below to listen to Thandi Moraka:
