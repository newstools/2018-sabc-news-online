The motion of no confidence vote in Nelson Mandela Bay mayor, Athol Trollip has collapsed in Port Elizabeth on Tuesday. Speaker Jonathan Lawack has adjourned the meeting permanently. Opposition parties have refused to leave council chambers while the coalition councillors have left the chamber. Opposition parties during the course of the meeting would not allow Democratic Alliance Provincial leader Nqaba Bhanga to pay tribute to the late Winnie Madikizela-Mandela. They also ignored calls from the speaker to please quieten down; this finally resulted in the collapse of the meeting. Mayor Trollip has called an immediate media conference.
