Metrorail says signal equipment failure on its northern line has forced its temporary suspension, with commuters experiencing further delays of more than an hour. Metrorail spokesperson, Riana Scott, says another affected line is to Kapteinsklip near Philippi. “The failure also affects the central announcement system and stations are reliant on local station announcements. Currently where possible trains are being held in stations to allow commuters the option to arrange lifts or switch to minibus taxis as delays already exceed 60+ minutes,” Scott says. “All trains scheduled to depart from Cape Town to the north and Kapteinsklip are being held back at Cape Town Station to prevent congestion on the lines. Commuters on board trains stuck in section are requested to please remain on board and not to disembark unless requested and assisted by Metrorail employees.” About Lyndon Khan View all posts by Lyndon Khan
