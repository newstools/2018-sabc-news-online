The two day summit will be held under the theme – “United by Legacy, Unified for Prosperity”. It aims to maximise the potential of economic and commercial partnerships between the two BRICS member states. This is the 25th year of of diplomatic relations between the two. India’s Consul General in Durban, Dr Shashank Vikram, explains the vision of taking trade relations to new heights. “India SA business summit is basically a unique event. It is the first time we are holding an event of this stature and this nature in SA,” said Vikram. “Both the business people from both sides, the chamber of commerce as well as government, for two days will sit and deliberate on how to increase the trade between India and SA.” “As you know, we aim at doubling the trade in the next five years and this two day event is going to focus on that.” About SABC View all posts by SABC
