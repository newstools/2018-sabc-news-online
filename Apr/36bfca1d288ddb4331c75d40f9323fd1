Leader of the Enlightened Christian Gathering (ECG) church Prophet Shepherd Bushiri says allegations made against him about transporting R15 million are completely false. This comes after SABC anchor Palesa Chubisi did a studio interview on the 4th of April with Pastor Daniel Phaladi who wrote an article entitled “Do you want miracle money?”. The discussion also focused on South Africa and the church – where she made reference to the confirmed investigation by the Hawks crime fighting unit into Prophet Shepherd Bushiri for allegedly transporting an estimated R15 million out of South Africa to his country of Malawi in his private Jet. Bushiri says he was not even aware that the police are investigating him and that he only heard about the investigation from the media. “I have never been approached by any law enforcement to say that I am doing anything illegal, I have never been questioned or served any warrant to say I am doing illegal activities. Since I was born or since I came to South Africa, I have never had any issues with the police.”  Click below to watch full interview:   Click below to watch Pastor Daniel Phaladi’s interview:   About Morning Live View all posts by Morning Live
