The African National Congress (ANC) as official opposition in the city of Cape Town, says it wants mayor Patricia de Lille removed through council processes and not internal DA politics. ANC leader in the council, Xolani Sotashe has lambasted what he says is the DA’s interference in the city’s administration. The DA caucus in the City is expected to remove de Lille through a vote of no confidence or by invoking the recall clause later on Wednesday. The recall clause allows the political party to remove or terminate membership. Sotashe says the city does not belong to the DA. “We are not going to allow to be reduced to a desk here as the administration by the DA because Mmusi Maimane and James Selfe are pseudo-mayors of this administration and spokespersons.” “We want de Lille to be removed but by the council, that’s the bottom line. So if they remove her in their caucus we know that the fight does not end, de Lille is going to challenge them. She is going to court,” says Sotashe.    About SABC Radio View all posts by SABC Radio
