Murder accused Sandile Mantsoe’s trial is expected to resume in the high court in Johannesburg on Tuesday. Mantsoe is accused of the murder of his girlfriend Karabo Mokoena whose burnt body was found in a veld in Lyndhurst north of Johannesburg in April last year. During Sandile Mantsoe‘s last court appearance the state had wanted to show the court a video footage from the Matsoe’s Sandton apartment taken the day Mokoena was allegedly killed. However when Judge AJ Johnson asked if those who retrieved the footage were present in court, the state revealed that there was no one present to testify on the chain of events. Experts who analysed the footage in Pretoria are also needed in court. The trial was then postponed to Tuesday(24 April) to allow for all witnesses to be present.
