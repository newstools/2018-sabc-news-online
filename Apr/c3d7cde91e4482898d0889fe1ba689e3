Trade and Industry Minister Rob Davies says trade relations between South Africa and India should be accelerated to enhance both economies. SA and India are holding their first business summit at the Sandton Convention Centre in Johannesburg. The two-day event is aimed at maximising the potential of the economic and commercial partnership between the two countries. Minister Davies says, “We need to take that relationship a lot further forward. We can do it because India is one of the fast growing economies in the world due to policies associated with Prime Minister Modi. South Africa is on a new economic path which President Ramaphosa has called a new dawn. Growing investor and consumer confidence is based on the fact that we have acted to deal with some of the challenges that held us back in the past.” Click below to watch video:   About SABC View all posts by SABC
