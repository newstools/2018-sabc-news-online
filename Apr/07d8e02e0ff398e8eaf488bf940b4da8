The African National Congress (ANC) has defeated the Democratic Alliance (DA) and the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) in the Mogalakwena Local Municipality in Limpopo in a by-election held on Wednesday. The ANC obtained a majority vote of 43%. The by-election came about as a result of the death of an ANC councillor three months ago. The Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) deemed the by-election as a success, with all 20 voting stations having opened on time and running smoothly. IEC Provincial Electoral Officer Nkaro Mateta says less than half of the registered voters participated in the by-election. “The ANC retain the ward and the percentage was 43.53%. The percentage poll was 31.4%, with the  Democratic Alliance at second best with 30.42%, while the other party which is the EFF came back with 26.05%.
