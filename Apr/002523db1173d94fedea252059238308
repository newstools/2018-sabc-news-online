Thirty-six Non-Governmental Organisations funded by government have handed over their memorandum of demands to the Health Department over the withdrawal of funding for HIV and AIDS programmes. The organisations are accusing the department of negligence and disregarding its own mandate to provide quality healthcare by withdrawing funding to the NGO’s without an explanation. These NGO’s provide counselling, HIV and TB treatment and also link communities with access to health facilities. AgriAid SA’s Monene Mamabolo says it is difficult for people to access health facilities because they do not have money. “So, people would actually not take treatment and this will be a problem because they will have resistance to drugs.”  About Phumzile Mlangeni View all posts by Phumzile Mlangeni
