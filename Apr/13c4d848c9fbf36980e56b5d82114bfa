The City of Cape Town says dam levels have dropped further over the past week.  The effect of Monday’s rainfall hasn’t been felt yet. Deputy Mayor, Ian Neilson, says the average water levels of dams supplying the metropole currently stands at about 20%. He says the city’s water consumption has decreased to 507 million litres per day compared to 542 million litres the previous week. Neilson says their water usage target under level 6B restrictions is 450 million litres per day. However, the rain has yet to have an impact on the water shortage in Cape Town.
