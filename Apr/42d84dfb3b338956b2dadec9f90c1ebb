Communications Minister Nomvula Mokonyane says government will not tolerate any form of racism in South Africa. She was addressing the media in Cape Town after a cabinet meeting. The comments comes after Mokonyane says she saw the incident where a effigy of  Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi being hung from a tree. Lesufi and his family have reportedly been receiving threats after the ANC-led government’s decision to change the language policy at certain schools in Gauteng. Mokonyane says they will continue to denounce such incidents. “It is quite disturbing that in the month of April where we remember the hanging of Solomon Mahlangu, the killing of Chris Hani and the passing of our stalwarts – in a month where were celebrate our hard warned freedom – that we still have a minority that seeks to actually act in this kind of way. On behalf of government we refuse any temptation that seeks to take us back to where we come from.”     About Abongile Dumako View all posts by Abongile Dumako
