African National Congress (ANC) Chairperson Gwede Mantashe says the party is losing credible cadres of the movement. This comes after news of the passing of ANC stalwart Zola Skweyiya at the age of 75 years on Wednesday morning. Skweyiya served as Public Service and Administration during the Nelson Mandela administration, and was also a Social Development Minister between 1999 and 2009 during the Thabo Mbeki administration. He was appointed as South Africa’s High Commissioner to the UK in 2009. “I think we are losing generations of cadres and stalwarts of our movement who have made a difference as we come out of a very difficult period and witness a new dawn that is emerging. Bhut’Zola has been in the ANC for a very long time.” “We send our condolences to the family, in-laws and to his maternal side of the family. He was quite a strong person. He gave up his professional future for the freedom of many others and undermined his own freedom,” says Mantashe.  Click below to watch:  About SABC Radio View all posts by SABC Radio
