Johannesburg Water has given the assurance that services will be restored to the CBD by Thursday afternoon. Residents in the  Doornfontein and surrounding areas including Berea and Yeoville have been without water since Tuesday, due to a burst pipe. Joburg Water spokesperson, Isaac Dhludhlu says they’ve been working around the clock to resolve the problem. “Our teams are on site. We have managed to complete the repairs in the early hours of this morning. We prioritised the resevoirs first so they can reach at least a minimum of 75 litres high before we can release the water to the residents,” adds Dhludhlu.
