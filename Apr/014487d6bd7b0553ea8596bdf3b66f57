The City of Cape Town has closed the water area at the Zandvlei Estuary Nature Reserve on the False Bay coast due to water quality concerns. The cityâ€™s biodiversity manager, Julia Wood, says high levels of E Coli were found following a sewage spill earlier in the week. Wood says the spill was a result of a bulk sewer main collapse which was subsequently contained. The closure applies only to recreational activities like fishing. Wood says other visitor facilities will remain open. The water area will remain closed until further notice.  About SABC View all posts by SABC
