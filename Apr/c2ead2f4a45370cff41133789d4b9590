Police are yet to make any arrests in connection with the alleged assassination of a Pakistani national on the M1 highway in Johannesburg last week. Majeed Khan was gunned down in peak traffic in what is believed to have been an orchastrated hit. Three gunmen smashed his car window and opened fire on him before fleeing on foot. It’s been reported that Khan was closely linked to Hawala, a money transfer scheme, and operated out of Johannesburg. Police spokesperson Mavela Masondo says the suspects in the case are still on the run. “As the police we have launched a manhunt for the suspects who are still at large, this is after the shooting that happened on the m1 where a male was shot and killed in his vehicle, but the suspects are still at large we don’t have a lead yet but we are appealing to the community,” Masondo says. “If there is anyone who has got information, please come forward and they can call the nearest police station or they can call crime stop which is 08600 10111.”  About Sashin Naidoo View all posts by Sashin Naidoo
