The African National Congress in Gauteng has condemned the behavior of two white people captured in a photograph, hanging a life-size doll dressed in an ANC t-shirt and a picture of education MEC Panyaza Lesufi, on a tree outside the offices of the Basic Education Department in Pretoria on Wednesday. The life sized doll had on it, a placard accusing Lesufi of raping Afrikaans. This follows several threats Lesufi had received together with his family after the ANC-led government’s decision to change the language policy at certain schools in the province from Afrikaans only to parallel medium schools. ANC Gauteng spokesperson Motalatale Modiba says they want Lesufi to lay criminal charges. “It has no place in our society. It is really saddening that following the recent Vicky Momberg case which has really set a precident in racial cases, that you will have people be so brazen enough to continue perpetuating racial hatred within our society. So we have urged him to lay crimen injuria charges to ensure that the law enforcement agencies can take this matter further and investigate it and ensure that the perpetrators can be brought to book.”    About Sashin Naidoo View all posts by Sashin Naidoo
