Mourners have gathered in Kwezana village in Alice in the Eastern Cape to pay their last respects to the late anti-apartheid activist, Archie Sibeko. He died on the 27th of March in England. Sibeko is being honoured with a special provincial funeral. The chairperson of the ANC, Gwede Mantashe, the president of the African National Congress veteran’s league and ANC’s provincial leadership are among the mourners. Sibeko is described as a dedicated cadre. But because of his activist work, he spent large parts of his adult life outside of South Africa. His daugher, Shula Sibeko says it was painful growing up without him. “It’s a painful thing not to have time to spend with your father, things were unusual and we had to understand that our father joined the ANC for a good cause. We knew about that and supported him, we are benefiting from his fights yes, but we suffered.”  About SABC View all posts by SABC
