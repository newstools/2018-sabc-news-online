The National Teachers Union says it’s saddened and disappointed that all Grade R teachers in KwaZulu-Natal did not receive their salary adjustments last week. Reports suggest the Grade R teachers were expecting to receive their salary adjustments that have not been paid since 2016. The union’s spokesperson Alan Thompson says they are even more disappointed since they met with the KwaZulu-Natal MEC for education Mthandeni Dlungwane where he assured them that the teachers will receive their salaries. Thompson says, “What is more disappointing the NATU had a meeting with the MEC for KZN Mthandeni Dlungwane where he assured and reassured us that he was working tirelessly to ensure that the problems of salaries for grade r educators in the province are being sorted out. Now we’re still waiting for them to get the retrospective payments of salary adjustments, instead they got no salary at all. Which means in their bank accounts zero Rand’s was deposited by the department.” Meanwhile, the KZN department of education says the teachers have already received their salaries of R6500 a month but the department is still working on ensuring they receive their outstanding salary adjustment that they haven’t received since 2016.
