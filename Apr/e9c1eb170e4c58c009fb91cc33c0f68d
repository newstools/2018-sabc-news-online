Anglo American has launched an education programme in partnership with the Department of Basic Education with the aim of improving learner educational outcomes in an initiative valued at R500 million over the next five years. “The programme we are launching is part of the Anglo American Sustainability Strategy. At the heart of it, is the company’s commitment to being an active corporate citizen that engages with the real issues and challenges facing South Africa,” says the Minister of Basic Education Angie Motshekga. In the last five years, Anglo American has invested more than R700 million in infrastructure and grade 12 learner support. “This ground-breaking initiative has been developed in partnership with the Department of Basic Education and complements the Department’s Action Plan 2019 – Towards the Realisation of Schooling 2030. The Action Plan 2019, details strategies that aim to improve the performance of South Africa’s schooling system,” says the minister. The programme will improve 100 early childhood development (ECD) sites and 100 primary and secondary schools located near Anglo’s mining operations. “At Anglo American, we know that the greatest investment we can make in our country’s future is to give our children access to high quality education,” says Norman Mbazima, deputy chairperson of Anglo American South Africa. The education department said the programme sought to see various achievements including 90% of learners aged five meeting the minimum requirements for school readiness, 90% of grade three learners passing with at least 50% in Numeracy and Literacy, as well as 65% of grade 12 learners passing with at least 50% in Mathematics.
