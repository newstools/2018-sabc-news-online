The High Court in Polokwane has dismissed a R3 million claim by the family of deceased learner Michael Komape. The five-year-old died in a pit toilet at Mahlodumela Primary School in 2014. The family brought the claim for grief and constitutional damages. However, the court has ordered the Basic Education Department to pay a total of R12 000 towards future psychological treatment for two of the Komapeâ€™s younger children. Judge Gerrit Muller has also ordered the department to provide the court with a plan on school sanitation in Limpopo by the end of July.    About Shibu Mamokgere View all posts by Shibu Mamokgere
