Police say the life-imprisonment sentence of a 29-year-old Soweto mother after protecting a perpetrator who has raped her two month old baby, was the first such case in South Africa. She was found guilty of aiding a crime, defeating the ends of justice and instructing someone to commit rape. The rape of the two-month-old happened two years ago. The baby was admitted to hospital after the incident and the doctor informed the police. The baby had undergone reconstructive surgery. Initially the mother said the child had fallen from the bed. Police spokesperson Vishnu Naidoo says this will set a precedent of those who want to shield perpetrators. “This is the first case where a person other than the perpetrator was actually convicted and sentenced to this long sentence for such a crime as rape. Of course it will be a benefit, it will serve as a deterrent moving forward in terms of preventing people from preventing criminals that have committed heinous crime such as this.” About Ditaba Tsotetsi View all posts by Ditaba Tsotetsi
