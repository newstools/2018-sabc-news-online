Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (Cogta), Zweli Mkhize, is meeting with black professionals in Johannesburg to discuss support to distressed and dysfunctional municipalities. The Minister will meet with black engineers, chartered accountants, auditors, lawyers, corporate governance experts and other professionals to discuss support to the municipalities, ahead of the Cogta Budget Vote in parliament next month. Mkhize recently announced that 7% of the countryâ€™s municipalities are classified as well-functioning and about 31% of the municipalities are reasonably functional, with 31% almost dysfunctional. He wants to create a pool of skills to utilise these professions for interventions in distressed municipalities. This will also address the challenges of unemployment especially for black professionals.  About Amina Accram View all posts by Amina Accram
