The South African Federation of Trade Unions, SAFTU, says all workers should join its nationwide strike against the national minimum wage and the new labour laws. The national shutdown is set to take place on Wednesday. SAFTU says the national minimum wage, which is set at R20 per hour is a slave wage and that the new labour laws will take away workers’ rights to strike. SAFTU General Secretary, Zwelinzima Vavi says all workers should join the strike regardless of which union they belong to. He says: “We are making a call to every worker, join the strike on April 25, stay away from work, join the marches, bring your own union regalia. Whether it is COSATU or any office affiliate, whether its FEDUSA or NACTU.” “Identify yourself with those that in 2018 mounted a resistance against this frontal attack on the rights of workers,” says Vavi.
