At least 25 people are now known to have died after two suicide blasts ripped through the Afghan capital, Kabul.

It has spurred an outpouring of grief among journalists, many of whom who’ve taken to social media to post tributes to their colleagues. This was an unprecedented attack. The first attack happened around 8Am local time when it was rush hour. It happened in a relatively residential area which is near to an Afghan police as well as the Nato base. Around 15 to 20 minutes later when aid has reached the scene to help the wounded, and journalists were there to cover the first attack, another attacker penetrated among the crowd of journalists and detonated himself. The statement from IS’s “Khorasan” province, the group’s Afghan branch, said a first attacker “struck the headquarters of the Afghan intelligence services in Kabul”.”Apostate security forces, media and other people rushed to the scene of the operation, where a brother took them by surprise and martyred himself with his explosives vest,” it added. It gave the name of the first bomber as “Kaaka al-Kurdi”, suggesting he was of Kurdish origin, and the second as Khalil al-Qurashi.  About AFP View all posts by AFP
