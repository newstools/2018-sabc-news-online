The Democratic Alliance (DA) in the North West say it welcomes and appreciate President Cyril Ramaphosa’s initiative of cutting short his visit to the United Kingdom to come to the province. Violence has erupted in Mahikeng since Wednesday and has led to a complete lockdown of the provincial capital. DA leader in the province Joe Macgluwa says, “We welcome the decision by the President to come here and we would like to say that we hope this is not a PR stance.” “The Premier must just be recalled by the President. We believe there is only one thing that can solve the problems of this province and that is to recall Supra Mahumapelo.” Ramaphosa is expected back in the country early on Friday morning after he cut short his visit to the United Kingdom. He will be meeting with African National Congress (ANC) leaders in Mahikeng to discuss possible solutions. The President was attending a Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in London.
