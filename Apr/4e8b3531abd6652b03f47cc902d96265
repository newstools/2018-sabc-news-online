A bus has been set alight, with several roads barricaded with debris and tree branches by a group called anti-Supra Mahumapelo at the North West capital. Firefighters are also trying to quell the raging flames on a building which was also set alight. Residents are demanding the immediate resignation of Premier Supra Mahumapelo. Hundreds of learners at Montshioa township in Mahikeng have just returned from all schools. A high number of police have been deployed there. Angry residents expressed their dissatisfaction with the premier. “We have been this way because we do not want Supra Mahumapelo. He is corrupt. He is taking everything for himself,” says one resident. Another resident says: “We want him gone. We do not want Supra Mahumapelo. We don’t have services while he is busy eating with the Guptas. He must go.”   About Lucas Mothibedi View all posts by Lucas Mothibedi
