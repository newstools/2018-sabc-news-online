The community of Blackheath outside Cape Town has called for better safety measures at the Buttskop Level crossing. This after a train collided with a bakkie at the crossing Friday morning claiming the lives of seven men. The bodies have been cleared from the scene and the bakkie has been removed. The cause of the collision is under investigation. In 2010, the community was shaken by a similar incident at the same place when a taxi jumped the boom and collided with a train, killing 10 children. Residents say they have had enough. “Sometimes that boom gate doesn’t lift. I call these people all the time. The other day there was a storm and the booms didn’t lift and the cars were stuck. They couldn’t move and the taxis were coming through the boom.” Are they going to wait for another 20 people to die before doing something,” says a resident.
