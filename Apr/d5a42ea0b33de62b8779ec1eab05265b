Eskom says it is working with National Treasury to source more coal for seven of its plants that don’t have adequate supply. The power utility’s spokesperson, Khulu Phasiwe, says Eskom Holdings is diverting coal to the under-sourced stations from facilities that have sufficient supply. He says the supply problem stems from mines which were linked to Gupta-owned Tegeta Exploration Resources. According to Phasiwe, the power utility is doing its best to avoid a return of loadshedding. “Obviously now, there’s a concern around the nation that loadshedding might make a come back. We’re gonna do everything possible to avoid that potential occurrence,” Phawise says.  About SABC View all posts by SABC
