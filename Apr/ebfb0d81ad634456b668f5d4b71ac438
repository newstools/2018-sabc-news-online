Police Minister Bheki Cele, accompanied by Generals, has addressed some of the protesting residents in the North West capital, Mahikeng. The residents want the recall of Premier Supra Mahumapelo. Cele appealed to residents to await the decision of the African National Congress (ANC) leadership on Mahumapelo’s future. He told residents not to torch property and to stop the violent protest. “We are meeting the President here at 12. We know your concerns, please stop with the violence and destroying of properties.” Meanwhile, there is great expectation from the President Cyril Ramaphosa’s visit. A resident says: “Most of us are expecting the President to announce or to persuade the Premier to resign. If he does not remove the man from his position, unfortunately the situation might continue and might be bad. We might see a 1994 reload.” President Ramaphosa will be meeting with ANC leaders in Mahikeng to discuss possible solutions. He left London where he was attending a Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting. WATCH BHEKI CELE BELOW:   About Patrick Dintwa View all posts by Patrick Dintwa
