The Hawks say they have made a break though following a multi-million rand foreign currency heist in Kensington in the east of Johannesburg over the weekend. The foreign currency worth about R30 million belonging to Brinks Finance Solutions was stolen, while it was in transit from Spartan near O.R Tambo airport to Selby. The Hawks have arrested five suspects across four provinces, in Bloemfontein, Kempton Park, Rustenburg and Nongoma following investigation. Hawks spokesperson Ndivhuwo Mulamu says, “Five of the suspects appeared before the Johannesburg Magistrate’s Court on Monday and the case was postponed to April 30 pending further investigation.” “We are expecting to make more arrests regarding this matter,” added Mulamu.
