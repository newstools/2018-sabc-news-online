Murder accused Sandile Mantsoe was not forced or threatened into pointing out the crime scene at which Karabo Mokoena’s body was found. This is according to state witness Andre De Klerk, a detective from Johannesburg north region. He’s been testifying in the High Court in Johannesburg. Mantsoe is on trial for the murder of his girlfriend Mokoena in April last year. Her charred body was found in an open veld in Lyndhurst in the north of Johannesburg. Detective de Klerk says he was called by another detective stationed at Sandringham to help with the pointing out of the crime scene on the 11th of May. This was a day after Mantsoe’s arrest. De Klerk says he interviewed Mantsoe at the Sandton police station and informed him of his rights. Mantsoe was asked if he was assaulted or threatened by anyone and his answer was no. He was then instructed to take off his clothes and de Klerk says no injuries were visible on his body. He said Mantsoe had taken the lead on the pointing out of the crime scene, saying “I was there, I removed Karabo’s body, put a tyre around her and burned her.
