The High Court in Pretoria will on Tuesday hear former Eskom CEO Brian Molefe‘s application for leave to appeal a ruling against his reappointment to the power utility. Molefe lodged the application in January in a bid to have the judgment against him reversed. In January, the court found that Molefe’s reappointment and his 11-million-rand pension payout were unlawful. Molefe will argue that his departure was unrelated to the early retirement agreement with the power utility. Watch related videos:   About SABC View all posts by SABC
