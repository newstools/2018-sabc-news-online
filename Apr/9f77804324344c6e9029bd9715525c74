Twelve suspected rhino poachers including a police officer have been arrested and three rhino horns confiscated in the Kruger National Park in Limpopo and Mpumalanga over the past five days. SANParks says one suspected poacher was shot and killed and three others were left injured after they exchanged fire with rangers. The South African national parks spokesperson Ike Phahla has attributed the successes to an effort that is being put in place to ensure that the animals are protected in the national park. Phahla says one of the suspects is a former army commander from the neighbouring Mozambique. “One of the suspects has since been identified as a recently retired Frelimo commander who was arrested in full uniform. So we had another success and apprehension of three other suspects after our rangers, the K9 unit and the air wing traced the group for the whole day,” says Phahla. Phahla further says another suspect was found to be a member of the South African Police services attached at the Skhukhuza police station in Mpumalanga.
