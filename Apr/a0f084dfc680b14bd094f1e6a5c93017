The Port Elizabeth magistrate’s court has postponed the human trafficking case of the controversial Nigerian pastor Timothy Omotoso for the final time before it’s referred to the high court. The fourth accused, in the advanced stage of pregnancy, also appeared in court with him and two other women. Omotoso’s petition to the Supreme Court of Appeal against the refusal of bail twice has failed. He was arrested by the Hawks on charges of human trafficking and charges of racketeering will be added against all the accused. He faces a total of 48 charges including sexual assault, human trafficking, rape and five charges relating to the contravention of the Immigration Act. The self-proclaimed prophet and leader of the Jesus Dominion International church remains in custody. The three women are out on bail.  About SABC Radio View all posts by SABC Radio
