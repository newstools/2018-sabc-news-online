Train services are back to normal on Metrorail’s northern line in Cape Town following Friday’s fatal crash at the Buttskop level crossing in Blackheath. Seven men tragically lost their lives when the bakkie they were travelling in to work collided with an oncoming train. Metrorail says the driver of the bakkie ignored the boom signals. The Railway Safety Regulator is investigating the incident. The regulator’s spokesperson, Madeleine Williams, also says they will be reviewing safety standards at level crossings across the country. “We are looking at strengthening the enforcement that needs to happen at level crossings. We are hoping that standard will be published before the end of this year. We will be looking at the minimum protection that is needed at level crossings across the country.”  About Lynne Arendse View all posts by Lynne Arendse
