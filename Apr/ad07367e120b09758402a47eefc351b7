The family of an elderly woman beaten to death during a farm attack and robbery at Umhlali, north of Durban, say they are struggling to come to terms with her death. It is believed her 77-year-old husband Maduray Govender was attacked by three suspects when he arrived at his farm. The suspects tied him up and dragged him into the house. They then attacked 70-year-old Virathapushma Govender. The couple’s nephew, Dan Reddy, says his uncle is recovering in hospital. He says: “His condition has improved quite a bit. He is communicating and he remembers what transpired. They were such humble people. They were very helpful and they were always there.” Reddy adds: “I was really shocked to see a 77-year-old and 70-year-old being traumatized and having them go through all of this, it’s unbelievable.”  About SABC Radio View all posts by SABC Radio
