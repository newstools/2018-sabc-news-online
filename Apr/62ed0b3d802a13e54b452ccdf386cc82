Unions representing bus drivers, including the South African Transport and Allied Workers Union (Satawu) and the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (Numsa), are planning to approach Transport Minister Blade Nzimande to request him to urgently intervene in their wage negotiations with the employers. This comes after negotiations between the unions and the employers deadlocked again on Tuesday night. The unions have revised their demand from 9.5% for the first year, while employers are offering 8.5%. Satawu Spokesperson, Zanele Sabela says, “The unions in the bus sector are going to be approaching Minister Blade Nzimande to get involved in the ongoing impasse in the wage negotiations.” “The negotiations collapsed last night, we were not able to sign an agreement because unions came down to 9.5 for the first year and and 8.5% of the second year. However, the employers are only willing to offer 8% for the second year and 9% for the first year.”   About Sashin Naidoo View all posts by Sashin Naidoo
