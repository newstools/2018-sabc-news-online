The DA has called on the Department of Human Settlement to account for the alleged disappearance of about R220 million earmarked to build 728 community residential units in Thabong-Welkom in the Free State. The G Block Housing project was aimed at replacing old asbestos roofs on a block of flats. The project was scheduled for completion in March 2016, but that never materialised. The community is fuming. The party conducted an oversight inspection of the area. The DA alleges that former SABC boss Hlaudi Motsoeneng and the wife of Fikile Mbalula, Nozuko Mbalula were awarded contracts through their Mbuma and MM Development. The Free State Human Settlement Department maintains that it terminated the contract because the contractor failed to perform. It says funds in the project are still in their budget.
