A shooting at Ivory Park, east of Johannesburg, has left one man dead and a 3-year old child wounded. Paramedics who were called to the scene say the body of a man believed to be in his 40’s was found in the drivers seat of a vehicle parked along a road. Upon examination, paramedics discovered that he had been shot and was unresponsive at the scene. “Unfortunately, nothing could be done for the man and he was declared dead by Provincial Services,” ER 24’s Russel Meiring says. A short time later, ER24 paramedics were lead into the house where a second patient was found. Assessments showed that a three-year-old boy had sustained a gunshot wound to his leg. Paramedics treated the boy and provided him with pain-relief medication before he was transported to a nearby hospital for further treatment. About Melini Moses View all posts by Melini Moses
