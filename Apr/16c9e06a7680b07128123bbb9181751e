North West Health MEC Dr Magome Masike he is confident that the crippling strike by National Health and Allied Workers Union (Nehawu) members which has halted health services will resolved. The Provincial Task Team met workers earlier this week and another meeting has been scheduled for Friday. Nehawu has been on strike for close to two months. About 396 clinics across the province are closed as a result and patients taking chronic medication are also affected. Dr Masike also says politics and not labour issues may be behind the strike. “The union is not entirely talking the language of the workers only, they are equally political…political issues are outside the scope of the task team.” Meanwhile, the Mahikeng Local Municipality in North West has called for calm at Montshioa township where angry residents went on the rampage today, calling for Premier Supra Mahupamelo to resign. Municipal Spokesperson Johnny Nkwane says the protest has been exacerbated by the unfortunate death of two people at the local clinic due to a two month long Nehawu strike. Residents torched a taxi and a bus while expressing their dissatisfaction with the premier. Watch the video below for related news:  About SABC Radio View all posts by SABC Radio
