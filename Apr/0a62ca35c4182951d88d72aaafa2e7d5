Labour federation Saftu’s general-secretary Zwelinzima Vavi has called for strict discipline among members of unions affiliated to Saftu who have started to march from Newtown, Johannesburg. There’s a heavy police presence in and around the Johannesburg city centre especially in the Newtown precint and many roads have been blocked off. The workers will march to places including the premier’s office in the CBD. Saftu’s nationwide action is against the R20 minimum wage and amendments to the labour law.   Meanwhile, Labour Minister Mildred Oliphant has accused labour federation SAFTU of misleading workers, saying it was part of discussions that led to an agreement on the minimum wage. She says what SAFTU is doing is unacceptable. She says: “They can’t come up today and mislead the workers while they were part and parcel of those discussions previously. When we’re saying it’s a national minumum wage, we’re saying no worker should be paid below R20 per hour.” “As long as you’re employed, you are defined as a worker. But we are saying, where there are wage agreements, minimum wages per sector will not change,” she adds.  About SABC Radio View all posts by SABC Radio
