The African Farmers’ Association of South Africa (AFASA) says it will convene an urgent meeting this week, with the Department of Agriculture in the North West, to demand the immediate return of a herd of cattle worth R1.5 million that was donated to former President Jacob Zuma.  The herd was reportedly sent by Premier Supra Mahupamelo. AFASA says, while the matter is currently a subject of the HAWKS investigations, the cattle must be returned from Zuma’s Nkandla home in KwaZulu Natal to emerging farmers in the North West, for whom the herd was initially meant. AFASA’s secretary, Molefe Mahape says they were shocked when they learnt of the donation. “We were shocked to hear that, given the plight of our farmers in the province; I mean on daily basis our farmers are in need of support, and we have hoped such a gesture will be directed towards our farmers. When we heard that, firstly we did not believe that such a thing could happen. Really it calls for us to meet urgently,” says Mahape. About Lucas Mothibedi View all posts by Lucas Mothibedi
