A woman’s daughter and grandson have been arrested for her murder after the woman’s husband found his wife lying in a pool of blood on Saturday. Police are urging anyone with further information about the murder of the 69 year old woman in Ratanda near Heidelberg in Gauteng to come forward. The police’s Lerato Mngomezulu says: “The investigation led to these suspects because the daughter was seen at the house before the deceased was found and the deceased had a protection order against her daughter.” The police are still investigating the matter. “We welcome any information that the community might have concerning the matter,” says Mngomezulu.
