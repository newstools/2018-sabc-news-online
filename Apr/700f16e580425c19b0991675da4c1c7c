The North West Health Department has welcomed the arrival of the South African National Defence Force (SANDF) health personnel to the province to assist at health facilities, particularly in Mahikeng. For weeks, the province has been experiencing unprecedented pressure on the health system. This is due to disruptions caused by the wage strike by members of trade union Nehawu. The recent community protests have also contributed to the challenges the health institutions are facing in the province. The Department’s Provincial Spokesperson Tebogo Lekgethwane says, “The SANDF will close that gap for some of our nurses who are not here, that will be the area that they are closing. We have seen them also early in the morning already beginning to sweep the floor, to mop up… and they will do a lot more for the Department.”   About SABC View all posts by SABC
