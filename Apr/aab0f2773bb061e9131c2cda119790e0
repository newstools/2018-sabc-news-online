The Democratic Alliance‘s Federal Executive has given Cape Town Mayor Patricia de Lille until next Wednesday to make submissions on why she should remain in office. This comes after the party’s caucus in the city council voted on Wednesday for her removal through a secret ballot. De Lille has been at loggerheads with the party in recent months over governance issues in the council. She currently faces a disciplinary hearing on charges of misconduct. Second Deputy Chairperson of the Federal Council, Natasha Mazzone explains the way forward. “Either the DA will say that her submissions are substantiated and we’ll look at remedial action to repair the relationship between Mayor De Lille and the city councillors. Or, we will find that in fact the action is valid and must stand as it is and ask the Mayor to resign. Should she not resign, her membership will then be terminated. However, if she does resign she will stay on as a councillor and retain her DA membership.” De Lille says she will not step down from her position, speaking to the SABC, says she feels the processes against her are unconstitutional she will take the matter to court. “I cannot resign and then the people of South Africa will think that I’m guilty. I want to see the proof these allegations must be tested in a open disciplinary hearing so that I can clear my name. I am prepared to become the guinea pig to test this recall clause where we can find the legal precedent whether this clause is constitutional or not. And if I have to clear my name through a fair process in a court then that is the route that I will go. If I don’t get a fair process within the disciplinary hearings of the DA I will certainly also there appeal any outcome.” Watch for more:   About Lyndon Khan View all posts by Lyndon Khan
