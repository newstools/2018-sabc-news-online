The Right to Know campaign has called on President Cyril Ramaphosa and State Security Minister, Dipuo Letsatsi-Duba to act against State Security Agency boss, Arthur Fraser. The organisation says Fraser had retained his post despite mounting allegations against him which indicate that he could not be left in charge of the spy agency. According to court documents filed by the Inspector General of Intelligence Setlhomamaru Dintwe‚ Fraser has interfered heavily in the Inspector General’s work‚ including revoking Dintwe’s security clearance. The Right to Know Campaign’s Murray Hunter says the revelation that Fraser has attempted to shut down the Inspector General of Intelligence’s investigations of these allegations, makes his removal all the more urgent.
