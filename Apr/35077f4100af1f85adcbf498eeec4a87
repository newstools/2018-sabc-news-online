Western Cape Environmental Affairs MEC Anton Bredell says his department will investigate claims that some people are stealing water released from the Bergriver Dam in the Boland . Five billion litres of water was released into the Misverstand Dam on the West Coast for household and industrial use. Bredell says the water is 24 km away from its destination. He says the flow is around 1 km per hour. Bredell says they received reports that some farmers are stealing the water along the way. He says those found guilty could be fined up to R10 million.
