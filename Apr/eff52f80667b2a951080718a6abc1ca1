Schooling and provision of other services continue to be halted in Rotterdam and nearby villages in Limpopo as residents continue a protest action demanding a tarred road. The protestors have been blockading the R81 road between Giyani and Polokwane with burning tyres and other rubble. Taxi operators are using an alternative gravel road and are in support of the protest. Learning and teaching has been disrupted at about seven schools as residents are continuing to demand a tarred road. Residents gathered at Sephokgobye where they are to be bused to an undisclosed location to map a way forward.  About SABC View all posts by SABC
