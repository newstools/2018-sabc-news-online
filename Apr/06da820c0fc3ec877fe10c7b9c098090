At least seven people have been killed in a collision between a train and a bakkie early Friday morning at the Buttskop level crossing in Blackheath outside Cape Town. This is the same level crossing where 10 children were killed in a similar collision in 2010, leading to taxi driver Jacob Humphreys being convicted of murder. The bodies of seven men lay scattered across the train tracks. The victims were all in the bakkie. Traffic spokesperson Richard Coleman says the circumstances of the collision are unknown at this stage. Community members of Blackheath say they are shocked that this level crossing has once again claimed innocent lives. Some community members say this accident could have been prevented. A crowd has gathered at the level crossing behind a police line as they anxiously wait to find out if their family members were part of the accident. Meanwhile, Metrorail says until the crash scene has been cleared, trains from Cape Town to Strand and Muldersvlei will terminate at Kuils River and a train shuttle will operate between Eerste River and Strand/Muldersvlei.
