The vehicles are five tipper and three water trucks. Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe says the trucks were en route to be smuggled out of the country and are believed to have been stolen in other provinces. Ngoepe says: “Police in this province are dealing head on with incidents of motor vehicles and cross border crimes. Joint operations are still working hard on these crimes in Levubu outside Thohoyandou.” The arrested suspect will appear before the Levubu Magistrate court on Monday. “Investigations are still continuing,” says Ngoepe.
