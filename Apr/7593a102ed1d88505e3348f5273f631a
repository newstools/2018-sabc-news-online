Some protesting residents of villages in the Sekororo area outside Tzaneen in Limpopo have dug a trench on the main tarred road demanding a tarred road leading to the villages. They want the Maruleng municipality to construct a road that they say was promised many years ago. Police spokesperson Moatshe Ngoepe says police have been deployed in the area to monitor the situation. Ngoepe has urged motorists to avoid using the Trichardsdal road and use the alternative routes. “Members of the communities went on the rampage and they dig that main road so that will be able to pass and this morning we are monitoring the situation to ensure that the road is opened. We are calling motorists to utilise alternative routes to make sure that they use the R36 road and use one of the roads but for now we are monitoring the situation.” Meanwhile, Ginsberg Township residents in King William’s Town in the Eastern Cape say they have suspended their protest action until Monday to give the Buffalo City Metro Municipality time to meet with them. Thursday night they barricaded roads in the township with burning tyres and rubbish after municipal authorities reportedly didn’t pitch for a meeting on housing. The last housing project in the township was in 1995. Spokesperson of the Ginsberg Civic Association, Thembalekhaya Simanga says the people are running out of patience. “I think the people have had enough of municipality. They have been begging and patient and done whatever they could but these guys are showing arrogance and not willing to work with people. On Thursday they were supposed to have an election for the ward committees as they promised but they didn’t turn up. The ward has been running without ward committees for two years and that’s not supposed to be because the officials don’t know what the people want and without the ward committees there’s no one to assist the people.” Attempts to solicit a comment from the municipality drew a blank.
