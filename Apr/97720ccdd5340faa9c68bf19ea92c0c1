The case of 14 Nigerian nationals facing charges of public violence and drug trafficking has been postponed to the 25th of this month in the Rustenburg Magistrate’s Court. A high police contingent was deployed inside and outside the court before the 14 could take the stand. They were arrested earlier this year. This happened after they stormed the local police station demanding protection, following a spate of violent attacks on foreign nationals suspected of trafficking drugs and running brothels. The trial was firstly postponed to allow the new legal team of the accused to familiarise themselves with the case. However, the representative failed to pitch on time, as the court was scheduled to commence in the morning. The court postponed the case to the 25th of this month, for the accused to resolve issues concerning their legal representative. Watch below for more on Rustenburg Magistrate’s Court Case.
