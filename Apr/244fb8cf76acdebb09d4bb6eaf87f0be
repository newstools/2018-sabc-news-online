A Northern Cape farmer, who allegedly drove over Shimmy Mosienyame with his bakkie on his farm on Friday, has handed himself to police. Itâ€™s alleged the 63-year-old farmer repeatedly used the K-word before driving over the man. An eyewitness says he and the victim were running from police following a service delivery protest in the town on Friday. They took a short cut across a farm and were stopped by the farmer. They allege the farmer demanded to know why they were trespassing. They claim the farmer hurled racial abuse at them before he chased them down. Mosienyame was rushed to the Kimberley hospital and is reportedly in a serious condition. About SABC View all posts by SABC
