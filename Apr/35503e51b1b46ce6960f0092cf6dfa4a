Saftu’s call for a stayaway appears to have fallen on deaf ears in the Buffalo City Metro which includes Bhisho, King Williams Town and East London in the Eastern Cape. Saftu has called for a national shutdown in protest against the R20 proposed national minimum wage and changes to the labour law. Taxi ranks, hiking spots and train stations were however full of commuters going to work. As early as six o’clock, passengers in Berlin and Mdantsane areas were filling the train stations and taxi ranks. Some say a day away from work will hit hard on the pocket. Workers have also been seen trickling in even at the Mercedes Benz plant in West Bank. However, the production unit is expected not to attend as most of its members are affiliated with Numsa. A march from Southern Wood to the Labour department in Quigney in East London is expected for some workers later on Wednesday. Meanwhile a handful of Saftu supporters has arrived at the meeting point in Kaizergracht in the Cape Town CBD for a march to the Civic Centre and Parliament. A small police contingent is keeping a watchful eye on them. Police have warned striking Saftu members to behave and to refrain from criminal behaviour.   About SABC Radio View all posts by SABC Radio
