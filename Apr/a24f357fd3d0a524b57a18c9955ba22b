The Economic Freedom Fighterâ€™s (EFF) National Chairperson, Advocate Dali Mpofu, says AfriForum is attempting to put pressure on the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) to prosecute party leader, Julius Malema. This after the Civil rights group announced that it will pursue a private prosecution against Malema on charges of fraud and corruption. The case relates to the On-Point Engineering case where Malema and two co-accused were charged in 2011 for unlawfully securing a tender and allegedly accepting bribes to award subcontracts. The case, which was heard in the Limpopo High Court, was struck off the roll in 2015 due to one of the accused being ill and unable to stand trial. The charges were never reinstated. Mpofu says there is no certificate by the NPA that says it is not willing to prosecute.
