The South African Transport and Allied Workers Union, Satawu, says bus drivers who have embarked on a national strike today, will continue with their strike action until their demands are met. Workers are demanding a 12 % salary increase. About 15 bus companies around the country are not operating, forcing thousands of commuters to make use of alternative transport. Satawu’s spokesperson, Zanele Sabela says around 16 000 workers are not satisfied with the current offer on the table from employers. “The employers only willing to give us 7%,” Sabela says. “They want us to sign a three year agreement. We’re looking at signing a one e year agreement, because we don’t believe that they are giving us enough to entice us into signing a long term agreement. We want a minimum wage of R8000 they want to give us R6070.  Night Shift is also a problem. We want 6PM to 6AM.”  Watch below for more on the nationwide bus strike  About Corbin August View all posts by Corbin August
