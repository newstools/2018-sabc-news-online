Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi has arrived at the Mahikeng Provincial Hospital in North West, where he will assess the state of public health in the province. The ongoing National Health Education & Allied Workers Union strike, for more than two months, has badly affected this and other hospitals in the province. Three patients died at the hospital last Wednesday night during the violent community protests which were calling for Premier Supra Mahumapelo to resign. Minister Motsoaledi’s visit comes as several health facilities remain closed.  Last week, two patients died in the chronic medical ward. Other patients say the two died during the night when there were no health professionals to look after them. SABC News also found bedridden patients in that ward on their own, with three nurses only attending to them later. MEC for Health Dr Magome Masike dismissed speculation that the patients may have died from neglect. He says they died from their chronic medical conditions. Health personnel from the South African National Defence Force (SANDF) have since arrived to give aid to the hospital. A strike by healthcare workers in the North West has led to the province running out of medicine and other medical supplies. Medical facilities in the province are reportedly running short on painkillers, chronic medicine, HIV tests, anti-retroviral, insulin and basic necessities such as gloves and syringes. Section 27, a social justice organisation, says 95% of hospitals and clinics in the area do not have medication.  About Sisi Segalo View all posts by Sisi Segalo
