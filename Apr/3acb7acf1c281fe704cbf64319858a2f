The Pietermaritzburg High Court is expected to make a ruling on Wednesday on whether it will uphold a judgment by Durban High Court Judge Achmed Jappie in the Shembe leadership matter. On the 18th of October 2016 Judge Jappie ruled in favour of the late Vela Shembe who was in a leadership battle with his nephew Mduduzi Shembe. Vela had taken Mduduzi to court after it emerged that the church elders had appointed Mduduzi as the successor to the late church leader Vimbeni Shembe. Vela, who led the Thembezinhle faction won the case after his lawyers convinced the court that Vimbeni had nominated Vela in a title deed which he had signed. Mduduzi then lodged an appeal. Thembezinhle spokesperson Nkululeko Mthethwa says they are optimistic that Wednesday’s judgment will favour them. He says: “With regard to the case that was in court which was subsequently appealed by eBubleni faction after we have won the case, we going there very optimistic that we are still going to win the judgement.” Meanwhile, the eBuhleni faction says should the court not rule in their favour, they will consult with their legal team on the way forward. eBuhleni Spokeperson Thokozani Mncwabe says: “If the judges do not rule in our favour, we will decide whether to appeal or not. But we will do it lawfully not by fighting. We know the law and it works, we cannot fight the law.” About Nonjabula Mntungwa View all posts by Nonjabula Mntungwa
