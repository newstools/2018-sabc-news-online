KwaZulu-Natal police are investigating the murder of yet another Glebelands hostel resident. Police Spokesperson Thulani Zwane says the 28-year-old man was stabbed to death on Sunday. This is the fifth murder at the sprawling hostel complex since the start of the year. Zwane says a murder case has been opened at the Umlazi police station. The hostel came under intense scrutiny at the Moerane Commission of Inquiry, established by Premier Willies Mchunu to investigate political killings in KwaZulu-Natal since 2011. While testifying before the Commission, activists working with hostel residents and residents themselves described Glebelands as a haven for hitmen working throughout the province and implicated police and politicians in hits. However, police top brass denied this in their testimony, saying the murders at the complex were “purely criminal”. The Commission ended last month after running for more than a year. It is set to release its final report and recommendations after April, although it remains unclear if this will be made public.
