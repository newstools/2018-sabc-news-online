Four people allegedly linked to militant group ISIS are on Wednesday due to appear again in the Verulam Magistrateâ€™s Court in the north of Durban. The defence is hoping that the bail application of two key figures, the couple Safydeen Del Vecchio and Fathima Patel, can be heard on Wednesday. Proceedings will however depend on whether one of their co-accused, Malawian national Ahmed Mussa has been able to secure legal representation. The bail applications hit a snag two weeks ago when one of the defence attorneys was severely reprimanded for unethical behaviour. The four accused are being charged with kidnapping and murdering a British couple in February. About SABC Radio View all posts by SABC Radio
