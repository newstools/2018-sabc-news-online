Health minister, Aaron Motsoaledi says the South African Army (military) will be asked to provide medics to assist with the ongoing health workers’ strike in the North West. The two months strike by Nehawu members has resulted in the closure of health facilities in Montshioa near Mahikeng and other places across the province. The shutdown has reportedly led to the death of two people at the Montshioa Clinic. The health workers align themselves with community demands that Premier Supra Mahumapelo must go, as well as the province’s Health HOD. Speaking on SA FM Minister Motsoaledi says some of the demands are beyond him. “Last night (Wednesday) I was still talking to the DG because they just gave us the list of the clinics that have been affected. And off course the depot but the military because the work with precision the actually want the number of people who are needed the doctors and the nurses. How many for each clinic should they help with, by last night we’re still waiting for that information.” Motsoaledi say he met with Nehawu on Monday and some of the demands they are making are purely for North West. “Other demands are beyond the department of health.” Click below to watch videos:   About SABC View all posts by SABC
