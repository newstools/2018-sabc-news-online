Social security agency Sassa in Gauteng is ready to *Go Live* and begin to migrate to the South African Post Office. On Wednesday, Sassa will start to pilot the move in their Soweto Local Office at Maponya Mall. This after the Constitutional Court declared the Sassa’s tender with Cash Paymaster Services invalid and instructed Sassa to source a new service provider. Sassa provincial spokesperson Nandi Mosia says, “Sassa feels very excited about this milestone achieved. It will be rolling out from Soweto local office to eventually roll out at all other local offices around Gauteng. What this translates to is when new beneficiaries come to apply for a social grant in any of our Sassa offices, Sapo officials will be there as well. Immediately after biometric enrollment, these people will then be taken to the site of Sapo where they will be issued with a card which they will be able to use from the 1st of May already.” Watch related videos:   About Sashin Naidoo View all posts by Sashin Naidoo
