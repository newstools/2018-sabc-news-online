Police have advised commuters travelling through Zandspruit, in the west of Johannesburg, to be cautious due to violent protests that have flared up since Tuesday. A community leader says residents have joined the South African Federation of Trade Unions (Saftu)’s national strike demanding an increase in wages and voice their grievances over land. Johannesburg Metro Police spokesperson, Wayne Minnaar says motorists should make use of alternative routes as tyres are being burnt and vehicles being stoned. “Protesters have become violent in Zandspruit area. They are stoning passing cars at the intersection of Beyers Naude and Marina Street. It is believed that the protests are linked to on-going protest of the removal of illegal structures in the Zandspruit area by JMPD officers. Motorists are advised to avoid that section for now,” says Minnaar.  Click below for videos:    About Ditaba Tsotetsi View all posts by Ditaba Tsotetsi
