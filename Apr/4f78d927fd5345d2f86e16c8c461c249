A most wanted criminal has been shot dead in a shoot-out with police at Tshimbupfe village in the Vuwani area of Limpopo.

The suspect was wanted for crimes ranging from armed robbery and car hijackings to house robbery in the area. “The police received information of the existence of the suspect at a certain house and on arrival at the house they started cordoning off that particular house the suspects apparently tried to escape through the window but the police were there and he apparently started shooting at the police. That is when the police retaliated and he was fatally shot. We recovered one revolver and sixteen rounds of ammunition. This particular case was reported to IPID for further investigation,” says Mojapelo. About SABC View all posts by SABC
