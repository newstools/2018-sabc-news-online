It has been an emotional morning in court for the sister of the murdered Karabo Mokoena. Bontle Mokoena is the second state witness in the Sandile Mantsoe murder trial underway in the Johannesburg High Court. Mantsoe is accused of killing his girlfriend Karabo in April last year. Her charred body was found in an open veld in Lyndhurst. Bontle Mokoena has been trying to hold back her tears as she recalls the last days she spent with her sister. After a short adjournment to allow her to compose herself, Bontle told the court she was supposed to have gone out with her sister on the 27th of April last year, but chose not to as she had to work the next day. Bontle says she had no idea when Karabo left her family home in Diepkloof and with whom. The next day they panicked and searched for her. They saw footage which showed Karabo entering and leaving Mantsoeâ€™s Sandton apartment, but he could provide no answers as to her whereabouts. Bontle broke down again saying, my mom warned her that he was going to kill her. The trial continues. Watch for more:  About Pearl Magubane View all posts by Pearl Magubane
