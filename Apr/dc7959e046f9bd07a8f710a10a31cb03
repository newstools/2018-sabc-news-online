The Economic Freedom Fighters says it will argue the issue of the secret ballot during the special council meeting in Nelson Mandela Bay to vote on the motion of no confidence in the mayor, Athol Trollip, speaker Jonathan Lawack and other mayoral committee members on Tuesday. EFF councillor, Yoliswa Yako says they wrote to Lawack raising concerns about the order of the agenda, and calling for a secret ballot vote but that it was not granted. The parties are calling for the removal of the Chief Whip, the Mayor and the Speaker, as well as the filling of the position of the deputy mayor. Yako says they want the speaker to be replaced by somebody who is not partisan. “The speaker currently is very partisan, he is not a chairperson of the council. He is carrying a mandate of the DA, which is not what we seek. We asked that the special session reflects what the majority had asked for. We also asked that there be a secret ballot, so we want to challenge those two issues firstly before continuing with the order of the day.”  Watch more:  About Olwethu Matsipane View all posts by Olwethu Matsipane
