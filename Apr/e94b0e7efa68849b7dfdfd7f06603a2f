Scores of members of unions that are affiliated to labour federation Saftu have embarked on a peaceful march in George in the Southern Cape. The march was delayed as organisers waited for their counterparts from Mossel Bay and Knysna to join them. Members are wearing colourful t shirts with the Saftu emblem on it and singing struggle songs as they march into the George CBD. The protesters have refered to the proposed minimum wage of R20 an hour as a slave wage and outright rejected it. Go George bus drivers who are part of the ongoing transport strike have also joined them. The march will see them head to the local municipality as well as the Department of Labour to hand over memorandum of grievances.   About Sagree Chetty View all posts by Sagree Chetty
