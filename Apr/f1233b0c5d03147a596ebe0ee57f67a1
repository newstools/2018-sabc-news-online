Saftu General-Secretary, Zwelinzima Vavi says Wednesday’s strike is not just a South African Federation of Trade Unions (Saftu) strike, but a workers’ demonstration against poverty, pay inequalities and status quo. This comes as the labour federation holds marches across the country in support of a one-day stay away against the proposed minimum wage and other labour issues. The union is opposing the proposed national minimum wage of R20 per hour or R3 500  a month, saying it is not enough for people to survive on. “It is a strike against an attempt to take away workers’ only instrument that makes them to give a meaning to collective bargaining. It is a strike against an attempt to reduce collective bargaining to collective begging, so it will go way beyond the narrow members of Saftu.” Unions affiliated to Cosatu and Fedusa have rejected calls to join the strike, schooling and trains are not expected to be affected by it.
