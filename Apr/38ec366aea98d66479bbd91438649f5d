The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) has sent a stern warning to those implicated in State capture that they will be found, regardless of where they are hiding. The Gupta family’s properties are now under curatorship after the NPA obtained a restraining order in the High Court in Bloemfontein. The curator visited the Saxonwold Gupta compound on Monday and is also expected to attach more properties totalling R250 million. The family and their businesses have been implicated in the Estina Dairy Farm theft and a money laundering case. NPA spokesperson Luvuyo Mfaku says those involved in State capture will face the full wrath of the law. “Anybody who is implicated in the so called State capture is actually going to be held accountable. So, the whole idea is to ensure that those assets are protected. They are under curatorship and if they are convicted once the trial is finished, then those assets will be forfeited to the State.” Watch the video below for more:   About SABC Radio View all posts by SABC Radio
