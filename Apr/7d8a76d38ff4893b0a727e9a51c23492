The City of Cape Town says they have identified 29 informal settlements prone to flooding during the coming winter season. Mayoral Committee Member for Safety, JP Smith, says some of the areas are situated in wetlands and close to ponds. He says they’ve implemented a number of interventions to mitigate the risk of flooding Parts of the N1, N2 and R300 highways have also been identified as flood risks. Roadworks to mitigate these risks are under way. “Mountain slopes in the Helderberg, South Peninsula and Table Mountain range that have been stripped of stabilising vegetation by fires are a risk for flooding or mudslides.” “The respective departments are working hard to address the risks but are also doing general maintenance like cleaning of stormwater and river systems and awareness drives on how to safeguard homes, particularly in informal settlements, from flooding and related risks,” says Smith.
