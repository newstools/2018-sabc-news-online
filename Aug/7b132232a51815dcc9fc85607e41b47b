A community on the KwaZulu-Natal North Coast which has been gathering mussels for generations has received a boost to make it sustainable in small-scale fishing. A co-operative of more than 200 people from KwaSokhulu near Richards Bay has received a donation of safety gear and first aid kits from the International Pole and Line Foundation. John Burton from the foundation says government had asked him to look at two such projects in South Africa to see how the foundation could assist. “This is part of a trial. We have gifted some equipment here. Some shoes for them, aquatic shoes for them, and gloves to stop them damaging the hands. And if they do get injured we also gave them some first aid kits. As I said in my speech, they’re part of the journey. We want to help this community to develop; we want to help them prosper,” says Burton.
