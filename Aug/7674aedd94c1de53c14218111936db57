The High Court in Cape Town has dismissed Henri van Breda’s application for leave to appeal his conviction and sentencing. He was sentenced to three life terms in June for the murder of his parents, Martin and Theresa as well as his brother Rudi. Van Breda was also sentenced to 15 years imprisonment for the attempted murder of his sister Marli. Judge Siraj Desai earlier found that Van Breda had used an axe to kill his family members at De Zalze Estate in Stellenbosch in 2015. Van Breda was also sentenced to 12 months imprisonment for the obstruction of justice. Earlier this year, the court found him guilty of using an axe to attack his family in January 2015. Breda’s counsel said the trial court erred in its finding that the circumstantial evidence presented by the State proves his guilt beyond reasonable doubt. Click video below:
