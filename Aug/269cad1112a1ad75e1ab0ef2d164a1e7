Observers say platinum mining giant Lonmin is still far from abiding by the Mining Charter to provide adequate houses for its employees, as part of its social and labour plan. Better living conditions were part of the demands by Lonmin employees in 2012, when they embarked on a violent unprotected strike. The strike claimed 44 lives, 34 of whom died at the Marikana Koppie when police opened fire on protestors on 16 August 2012.  Although the mine has reported that more has been done to address these challenges, the Bench Marks Foundation says its research shows that the company has not fulfilled its promises. “Nothing has changed. If you look at the situation, we still see squalid conditions. Workers have lost their jobs, lack of service delivery. We still see people not having sufficient water to use, and people are still living in shacks as we know. Informal settlements are still there, despite promises that were made six years back,” says the organisation’s researcher Chris Molebatsi. Lonmin is on record as having said it had budgeted R500 million to build between 300 and 400 housing units every year from 2013 to the end of this year.  The mine is commemorating the loss of its employees on Wednesday, where it is expected to announce the work it has done so far to improve the living conditions of its employees.
