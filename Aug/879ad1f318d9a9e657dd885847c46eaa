The South African Weather Service has issued an alert that there may be heavy rains over the southern part of KwaZulu-Natal that may lead to localised flooding between Thursday afternoon and Friday morning. For Friday very cold conditions and snowfall are expected over the southwestern parts of the province like Kokstad, Underberg and the Southern Drakensberg. Forecaster Wisani Maluleke says these conditions are due to a cut off low pressure system. He has urged people to be cautious. He says: “With this low from Thursday, we are expecting gale force winds between East London and Durban. But that will be from the afternoon and going into Saturday in the morning. There will also be wave heights of 4.4 – 5.6 metres from East London to Richards Bay.”
