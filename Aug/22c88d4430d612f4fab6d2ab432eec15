Zimbabwe opposition party leader, Tendai Biti, has been released after being detained close to the Zambian border with Zimbabwe. Biti had tried to flee to Zambia amid a police crackdown in Zimbabwe on those alleged to have instigated the Harare protests as the national election results were being released last week. The army was called in and used live ammunition on the protesters. Six people were killed. Biti’s current location is not clear. Police said earlier they want to question Biti following the country’s disputed elections last week. Biti’s lawyer Mlilo Nqobizitha explains why his client was heading for Zambia.
