Community members of Diepsloot, north of Johannesburg hope that working together with the police, they’ll be able to stop more child killings. A group of protesters, including social workers staged a demonstration outside the Diepsloot Police Station over the brutal killing of children on Wednesday. In the most recent case, a disabled six-year-old boy was found killed last week. In another incident, a teenage girl was raped before she was brutally murdered. The group handed over a memorandum to the police before they dispersed. One of the protesters, Mpumi Mndaweni, who’s also a senior social worker at the National Children and Violence Trust, says they wanted to find out from the police how they can help. “I’m happy that they’re open to work with us, I’m happy that they’re open to work with all stakeholders that are involved in Diepsloot. I’m just hoping that us working together will bring about a positive change in the community and that people will, if they have any concern concerning their children or anything that they know, the police doors are always open and that they can come and report cases in due time, not after three hours or four hours when a child has gone missing”.
