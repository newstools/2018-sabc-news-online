Gautrain employees affiliated to the United National Transport Union (UNTU) say they are happy that the protest action has come to an end. Workers downed tools and embarked on a two-week long strike which affected the railway operator’s schedules and commuters. UNTU has just signed a deal accepting an 8% salary increase, a minimum wage of R8 500 and a R900 housing allowance. Workers say although not all their demands have been met, they are happy that the protests were fruitful. The workers were demanding a wage increase of 10%. UNTU Deputy General Secretary Pieter Greyling says, “We welcome the fact that we could reach an agreement after marathon interventions. You can see that our constituents are very happy with what we have managed to reach. When you negotiate you would like to reach a better conclusion. But I think under the circumstances where commuters have been put in a bad situation, we ended the strike.” Click below for more:
