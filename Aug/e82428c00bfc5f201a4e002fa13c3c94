Duduzane Zuma’s culpable homicide case has been postponed to the 26th of October at the Randburg Magistrates Court, north of Johannesburg. Duduzane Zuma arrived in the company of his father, former President Jacob Zuma.  The two sat in the front row of the court benches chatting and laughing ahead of the proceedings. The son of the former president is charged with two counts of culpable homicide following the fatal 2014 car crash on the M1 highway in Johannesburg. One of the victims Phumzile Dube was killed after Zuma’s Porsche collided with the taxi in which she was travelling. Her fellow passenger Nanki Mashaba‚ who was also injured in the crash‚ died in hospital a few weeks later. Security is tight and only family members were allowed inside the courtroom.
