President Cyril Ramaphosa has called on Zimbabwe’s opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) -Alliance to concede defeat and move on. He was among some African leaders and guests who attended the inauguration in support of President Emmerson Mnangagwa at a stadium in Zimbabwe’s capital, Harare. Ramaphosa says in elections, there are winners and losers. “We’ve been saying that political parties that ran for an election and did not succeed, their leaders must accept this outcome and must move on. It’s now time to rebuild Zimbabwe to make it strong and there will be another chance in another election. That is what always happens in elections.” Mnangagwa’s children have expressed their excitement over their father’s victory. “It’s a joyous day for us as a family and as a country, ecstatic. We are elated, excited! We are glad that the second republic has come. So, we are very happy. The future is bright for Zim. Well done, dad! We are very excited. It’s time to move on forward and build the nation again. I’m excited for him. I’m so proud of our dad. He’s done a great job. Congratulations to dad. We are very excited.” WATCH – Mangagwa sworn in a president:
