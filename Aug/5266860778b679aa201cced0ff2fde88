The Department of Education in KwaZulu-Natal has welcomed the resignation of a young educator from Westville Girls High School, after her alleged racist rant at the school last week. It is believed that the teacher had entered into a heated debate with pupils about the South African political landscape. It is alleged she had also used the k-word in the classroom. Department spokesperson Muzi Mahlambi says she resigned on Monday before the Department could begin its investigation.. “We had not started with our disciplinary action, but the school had initiated such. She saw it fit to resign, because she realised the implications of what she had committed before we came in. As a young democracy, as a country South Africa – we have zero tolerance for people who will then come with utterances that are taking us back in terms of what is it that they are saying.”
