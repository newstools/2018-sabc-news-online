African National Congress (ANC) Tshwane region says widespread corruption in the city of Tshwane prompted their decision to table a motion of no confidence against mayor Solly Msimanga. The motion was tabled on Wednesday during a special council sitting in which the council was debating the suspension of city manager Moeketsi Mosola. ANC Tshwane region briefed media in Pretoria outlining reasons behind their decision to want to get rid of the mayor. It is the second time Msimanga faces a motion of no confidence following the Economic Freedom Fighters’ (EFF) motion. ANC Chairperson in Tshwane Kgoshi Maepa says: “The motion is to be tabled in the upcoming council meeting scheduled to sit on the 30th of August 2018. The urgency arises as a result of a special council meeting on 22nd of August 2018.” “It is clear from the report presented by the executive mayor at the special council meeting that he in fact knew about the alleged irregularities associated with multi billion rand happenings in the office of the city manager,” says Maepa.
