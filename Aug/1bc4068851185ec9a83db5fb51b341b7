Democratic Alliance (DA) leader Mmusi Maimane has called for an urgent sitting of the National Assembly to deal with the African National Congress (ANC) decision on expropriation of land without compensation. President Cyril Ramaphosa announced on Tuesday night that the ANC’s National Executuve Committee (NEC) Lekgotla had resolved to amend Section 25 of the constitution to allow for land expropriation without compensation. The DA believes that the move seeks to undermine the ongoing public hearings on the issue. “Here in the Western Cape, we still have about five public land hearings that need to take place between today and Saturday. Clearly, it’s pre-mature for the president to come and make the announcement. So, we need to find out if this process was properly followed. There are still half a million submissions to be processed by the committee. The leader has already written to the Speaker of the National Assembly requesting the immediate reconvening of Parliament for an urgent sitting to deliberate on this matter,” says Maimane’s spokesperson Portia Adams.
