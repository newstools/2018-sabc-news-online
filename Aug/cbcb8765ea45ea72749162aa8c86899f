Six suspects arrested in connection with the murder of the Mbizana Chief in the Eastern Cape are expected to appear at the local magistrate’s court on Tuesday. They face charges of murder, arson and malicious damage to property. Chief Thulani Mjanyelwa was killed and set alight allegedly by an angry mob over allegations that he was behind the murder of his sub-headman’s two sons three weeks ago. The villagers went on a rampage vandalising the chief’s home before he was killed on Sunday. The chief’s wife and his child have fled fearing that they too will be killed. The arrests angered residents and sparked protests on Monday. Rubber bullets were fired to disperse the crowd. Villagers are expected to picket outside the court calling for the release of the six suspects.
