Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) spokesperson Mbuyiseni Ndlozi has dismissed AfriForum’s allegation that party leader Julius Malema fired an assault rifle during the party’s fifth anniversary celebrations in East London. AfriForum filed criminal charges against Malema at Lyttleton police station in Centurion, south of Pretoria, on Wednesday. Ndlozi says the allegation have no basis and that the alleged firearm was not real. “It was not a firearm and no real ammunition or bullets were fired. It was emulation as part of the celebrations of the EFF that was also coordinated with fireworks. We did that to evoke both celebration and memory of our struggle during colonial and apartheid times.”. “AfriForum is obviously being opportunistic in this case because it is very clear as a bunch of Ku Klux Klan, they have made the Commander in Chief of the EFF and the EFF their agenda. Motivated obviously by anti-black race. Because they led a march called Black Monday in which real guns were displayed and in some instances fired. It is important to ask them whether they have also in that case open cases against those people if they so care about public law,” adds Ndlozi. AfriForum is also contemplating reporting the head of EFF security Andrea Snyman to the authority regulating the private security companies.
