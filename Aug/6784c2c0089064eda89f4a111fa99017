The Department of Home Affairs says all its systems are back online and that all offices should be operating as usual across the country on Monday. Services such as the issuing of birth, marriage and death certificates, as well as smart ID cards and passports, were affected on Friday following an outage at the State Information Technology Agency (SITA). Acting Director General at Home Affairs Thulani Mavuso says they’ve concluded the testing of their systems and expect things to run smoothly on Monday. “Based on what we’ve done, so far everything is 100%. We have had our technical team on site the whole day on Sunday to make sure that we’re ready for Monday. All provinces have confirmed that their offices are online. Except I think one or two in North West, which we’re still attending to, but other than that it’s all systems go.” Watch more below:
