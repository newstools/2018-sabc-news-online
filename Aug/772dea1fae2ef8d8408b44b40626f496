Former Deputy Finance Minister Mcebisi Jonas will be among the first to testify at the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture in Parktown, Johannesburg. The Commission will begin its hearings on Monday. The Commission says Jonas will be joined by former Member of Parliament Vytjie Mentor, Senior Treasury staffer Ndleleni Mathebula and others. Jonas has claimed that he was offered R600 million by the Guptas if he accepted the job of Finance Minister to replace Nhlanhla Nene three years ago. He says he declined the offer and then President Jacob Zuma shortly thereafter replaced Nene with Des van Rooyen. The Rand subsequently collapsed and Zuma, three days later, replaced Van Rooyen with Pravin Gordhan. Commission Spokesperson Mbuyiselo Stemela says they are looking at a range of other witnesses who will be called at a later stage.
