The Mangosuthu University of Technology outside Durban has commissioned an external auditing firm to look into safety measures of its 17 residences. This follows the brutal murder of Zolile Khumalo who was shot and killed allegedly by her ex-boyfriend at the Lonsdale residence in Durban three months ago. Vice Chancellor Enoch Malaza says they’ve installed security cameras in all their residences and they have upgraded their entry passes. Malaza says they will discuss finances with their council for longer term security measures. “At the same time we commissioned an audit which has just finished now and we have the recommendations of the audit which we are taking to the finance committee as for a long term plan. We will have to work with the service providers to improve the security. So the costs will have to be negotiated with the university and the private owners of the residences,” says Mazala. Malaza says he is planning to develop the institution so that it can help improve the Umlazi area – where it is located south of Durban. Malaza was speaking on his plans after his first hundred days in office. He says the university’s location in the township is ideal in that it should be accessible to the community. Malaza says they plan on developing the university, adding sports grounds that the students can use. “In fact we are not that visible in terms of national competition compared to other universities. We are aware of that and it’s our priority to take sports as one of the key focus areas to build facilities. Being in a township for me is not a disadvantage I think it is an advantage because it gives you also a purpose that you can serve the community and in that way you can add value also to national development,” says Mazala.
