KwaZulu-Natal African National Congress Chairperson Sihle Zikalala says clean audits in government departments and municipalities should translate in improved service delivery. Zikalala was speaking at the party’s provincial Lekgotla in Durban. He warned that the governing party will clamp down on its deployees who think that they can employ their cronies in government departments or municipalities. “Of ensuring that officials in municipalities are not subjected to pressures due to those who would want things to be done incorrectly. That political head of government should ensure that there is no abuse of accounting officers. The ANC has always condemned the tendency of political deployees who would want to appoint HODs or municipal managers who are their appendages with no capacity.”
