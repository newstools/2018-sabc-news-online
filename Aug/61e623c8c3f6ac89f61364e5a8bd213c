Former African National Congress MP Vytjie Mentor is expected back on the stand, where she will continue with her testimony in the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture in Parktown, Johannesburg. On Monday, Mentor revealed in her testimony how she was offered a ministerial post by one of the Gupta brothers at their Saxonwold compound in Johannesburg. Mentor revealed to the Commission how she was duped into a meeting with former President Jacob Zuma, and how she learnt of an upcoming cabinet reshuffle in 2010, through one of the Gupta brothers, Ajay, who then offered her the position of Public Enterprises Minister. She testified saying, had she had taken up the offer, she would’ve been expected to cancel the SAA flight route from Johannesburg to Mumbai, India at the Guptas’ request. But she disclosed to the Commission, that she declined the offer and said once former Minister Barbara Hogan was dismissed from her post, Minister Malusi Gigaba took over and then allegedly cancelled the route.
