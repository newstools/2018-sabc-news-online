ANC Deputy Secretary General Jessie Duarte says it is a misconception that land expropriation will plunge South Africa into crisis. This emerged at the Nontsikelelo Albertina Sisulu memorial lecture in Ngcobo on Tuesday. Ownership of land will be the first step to restore the dignity of rural women. These were the words of Jessie Duarte, while addressing those attending the lecture. She said a lot needs to be done to emancipate women across all spectrums and was unequivocal on the land redistribution policy. “Land expropriation should not allay fears. I think it is a deliberate misinformation to destabilise the movement. It should be done and be done in constitutional terms.” The event organised by the department of Social development also highlighted the ills of human trafficking in the province. Social Development MEC Phumza Dyantyi says:”We are saddened by the developing of human trafficking. In PE, there were 23 Malawian girls and boys that were caught in PE. This will give us a direction as to tracking the perpetrators.” Family member Luyanda Ndiphiwe Tetiwe says:”We wish for the construction of institutions such as clinics and roads named after her that will make us rejoice and keep her name alive.” Duarte says the national structure of the ANC will lead the way on the issue of land reform.
