Parliamentâ€˜s Police Committee has adopted the Critical Infrastructure Protection Bill that is replacing the National Key Point Act of 1980. The Chairperson of the Committee, Francois Beukman says the bill sets out clearly the process of how critical infrastructure should be identified and declared. He says to ensure that this is done in a transparent way, the Bill suggests the establishment of the Critical Infrastructure Council, with representation from both the private sector and civil society. The Bill will be sent to the National Assembly for debate and consideration.
