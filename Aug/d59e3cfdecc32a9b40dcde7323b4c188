The application to extend the bail of former Northern Cape ANC provincial chairperson, John Block and Trifector businessman Christo Scholtz has been granted. The two appeared in the Northern Cape High Court on Monday in Kimberley. Block and Scholtz are currently out on R150 000 bail after being found guilty of among others, fraud and corruption. They’re expected to pay an additional R50 000 bail. The Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA) in Bloemfontein dismissed the duo’s appeal last week after they challenged their 15 year sentence imposed on them by the Kimberley High Court in 2016. The SCA however, didn’t make an order when the two should hand themselves over to Correctional Services facilities in Kimberley. Block and Scholtz took advantage of the extension of bail application as they plan to head to the Constitutional Court in a bid to appeal their sentence again. Watch related video below:
