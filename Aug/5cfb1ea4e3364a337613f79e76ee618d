A meeting, where the representatives of Steinhoff were supposed to appear before Parliament’s Standing committee on Finance, has been moved to the end of this month. According to the chairperson of the committee, Yunus Carrim, this is because those representatives are scheduled to appear in court in the Netherlands on the 21st of August, and will only be able to make the proposed meeting on the day after that by noon. Steinhoff, a multinational retailer, has been embroiled in a massive accounting scandal.
