The South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) has on Wednesday  replied to a complaint by the Democratic Alliance (DA) to the BCCSA regarding the broadcast of a recorded statement by African National Congress (ANC) President, Mr Cyril Ramaphosa on 31 July 2018. The content of the statement was the ANC’s position on land expropriation as well as the economy. The SABC says in a statement that it has “no intention of engaging in a dual approach in dealing with the matter, and will instead allow space for the BCCSA process to unfold.” “The public broadcaster urges all parties involved to allow the process to reach its logical conclusion.” The DA has given the SABC until midnight on Wednesday, 8 August 2018 to air a packaged video of the DA Leader, Mmusi Maimane, speaking on land reform to the SABC. The DA in a statement released on Monday, says that it is not just about the content of the broadcast but the principle that the public broadcaster must uphold. “This is highly irregular and unacceptable for the public broadcaster to accept a packaged video from a political party, to interrupt normal programming to air the recording, and then deny opposition parties the opportunity to do the same.” READ STATEMENT BELOW:
