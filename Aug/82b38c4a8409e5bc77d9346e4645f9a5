Cape Town’s Disaster Risk Management Centre says rain has affected more than 300 homes in Khayelitsha on the Cape Flats. Spokesperson Charlotte Powell says the areas most affected are SST Section, Green point and Harare Section. She says the City’s Informal Settlements Department has been requested to provide plastic sheeting and flood kits. In Zone 20 in Langa, two homes that were built on a drain, were damaged. Powell says a request was sent to possibly relocate them. She says the situation does not warrant the activation of emergency shelter or the facilitation of humanitarian relief.
