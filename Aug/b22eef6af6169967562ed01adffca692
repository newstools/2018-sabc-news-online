The United Nations (UN) has called on the leaders and people of Zimbabwe to exercise restraint and reject all forms of violence. The Secretary General’s Deputy Spokesperson Farhan Haq says the UN is monitoring the situation on the ground. “Yes, we have been monitoring and we are concerned about the reports that there have been incidents of violence in some parts of Zimbabwe. We’d like to remind the incumbents and political parties about the commitments they made in the peace pledge and the code of conduct to ensure a peaceful electoral process. We call on the political leaders and the population as a whole to exercise restraint, and reject any form of violence while awaiting resolution of the disputes and announcement of the election results.” Three people have been killed in Wednesday’s violent protests in the Zimbabwean capital Harare following the announcement of the election results for the National Assembly. The protestors from the opposition MDC party clashed with police that retaliated with rubber bullets and teargas. Gunfire was also heard. The army has now been deployed in the streets of Harare to assist the police. Additional reporting by SABC News:
