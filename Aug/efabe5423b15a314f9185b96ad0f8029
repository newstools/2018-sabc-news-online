The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) says it is expecting tricks from the DA-led administration to remain in power in the Nelson Mandela Bay Metro. The EFF tabled a motion of no confidence in Mayor Athol Trollip in Monday’s chaotic council meeting in Port Elizabeth, which saw his removal. Trollip was ousted out in absentia and replaced by UDM’s Mongameli Bobani. Speaker Jonathan Lawack was also ousted after DA councillor Mbulelo Manyathi abstained during voting. The EFF’s Eastern Cape Convener Marshall Dlamini says: “We are happy with the way our councillors conducted themselves. They behaved like responsible leaders who have been put here by society to come and lead them to make sure there is progress in the Nelson Mandela Metro.” “So we expected the tricks but we are happy with the results as we made a commitment that we are going to remove Trollip,” adds Dlamini.
