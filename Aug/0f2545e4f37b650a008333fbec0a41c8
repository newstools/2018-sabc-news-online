The former President of the Pan Africanist Congress (PAC) Women’s League, Ellen Mothopeng has lashed out at her party for not allowing more space for women to lead. Mothopeng was among party members who gathered in Johannesburg to pay tribute to Veronica Zondeni Sebukwe on Wednesday. Mama Sobukwe was the wife of the founding president of the party, Robert Sobukwe. She also says women need to play a bigger role in the party. Mophopeng urged the PAC to unite in memory of Mama Sobukwe. “This Pan Africanist Congress of Azania, it has to be protected, it is not owned by individuals. It is our own movement. It is our own movement, therefor we need to protect it,” says Mophopeng. Another memorial service was held in Eastern Cape where PAC leader, Nerius Moloto told the mourners that dispossessed land needs to be redistributed without any delay. Moloto says the freedom that Sebukwe and others fought for has shortcomings if people have no land. “Without land, we can’t develop economically. Our freedom has serious shortcomings without land. Government must introduce policies that will redistribute land without disrupting the economy,” says Moloto. Sobukwe is expected to be buried during a Special Official funeral at Graaff- Reinet in the Eastern Cape on Saturday. Watch the video below for the full memorial service in Eastern Cape:
