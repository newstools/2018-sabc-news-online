The first of several land public hearings in the Western Cape will kick off in Oudtshoorn in the Little Karoo on Wednesday. This is the last province in which the hearings will take place after the rest of the country. The Parliamentary Review Committee has been trying to get South Africans’ views on whether Section 25 of the Constitution should be amended to allow for the expropriation of land without compensation. The hearing , which is expected to draw hundreds of people from across the region, will be held at the Thusong Centre in Bongolethu. It then moves to Beaufort west in the Central Karoo, Swellendam and Citrusdal before moving on to Cape Town. The hearings are being held by Parliament’s Joint Constitutional Review Committee. Meanwhile, on Tuesday President Cyril Ramaphosa announced that the African National Congress (ANC) would move forward with plans to change the Constitution to allow the go ahead of land expropriation without compensation.
