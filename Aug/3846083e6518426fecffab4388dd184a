Public Protector, Busisiwe Mkhwebane, has called for some MPs on Parliament’s Justice committee, to recuse themselves from a discussion about her removal from office. This, as DA Chief whip John Steenhuisen wrote to the Speaker of the National Assembly, Baleka Mbete, to institute an inquiry into Mkhwebane’s fitness to hold office. The meeting  has been postponed. Parliament’s Justice Committee is looking into this matter after a complaint by Democratic Alliance (DA) Chief whip, John Steenhuisen that Mkwebane should be removed from her position. Steenhuisen made a presentation to the committee in June, citing scathing comments made by the North Gauteng High Court regarding Mkhwebane’s BankCorp ruling. In it, he cites the scathing comments made by the North Gauteng High court regarding Mkhwebane’s BankCorp ruling. In a written reply to this, Mkhwebane says due to discussions about her removal in previous meetings, Mkhwebane says it shows that a fair hearing before some of these MPs won’t be possible. In her 25 page response Mkhwebane also says Steenhuisen could not prove incompetence on her part, because having any of her reports taken on judicial review, does not show incompetence on her part. Opposition MP, Glynnis Breytenbach, lamented the tardiness of committee staff. She says: “We got this after 11pm Tuesday night, we need more time to go through it. This is a very important exercise, it is something we take very seriously. Scheduling a meeting and only sending out the document after 11pm is really unacceptable.” A meeting scheduled to deal with this letter has been postponed to give MPs sufficient time to study it.
