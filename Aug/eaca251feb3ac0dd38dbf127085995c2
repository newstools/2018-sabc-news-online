Trade union Numsa has threatened to withdraw from wage talks with Eskom after accusing the power utility of negotiating in bad faith. This comes after Eskom said that it would not accede to the unions’ demands as some employees were involved in acts of sabotage during an unprotected strike. Numsa says Eskom’s strategy is to dismiss union members for participating in the strike. The parties have now delayed the signing of the wage agreement. Numsa spokesperson Phakamile Hlubi-Majola says: “There must be clear evidence of misconduct and there must be proper processes to prove this misconduct. There are also things within Eskom’s own disciplinary code that can be used to deal with misconduct which will not result in the dismissal of members.” “The second issue is here you have an SOE which has been brought to the brink of financial ruin because of the behaviour and misconduct of senior executive management, ” adds Hlubi-Majola.
