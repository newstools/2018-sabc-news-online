The Democratic Alliance (DA) in Nelson Mandela Bay insists Athol Trollip is still the mayor and will report to work as usual on Tuesday morning. The DA says the removal of Trollip on Monday night was illegal. A chaotic council meeting was seen on Monday were Trollip was removed from his post after DA caucus members and the municipal manager walked out of the chambers after the removal of its speaker, Jonathan Lawack. The United Democratic Movement’s Mongameli Bobani was elected to replace Trollip. The DA has described the meeting as a mock council sitting, which was illegal, insisting it would challenge the validity of Trollip’s removal. The DA’s leader in the Eastern Cape, Nqaba Banga, says they will do everything to reverse Monday’s council decision. He says, “The mayor of Nelson Mandela Bay is Athol Trollip. In the chairs where the city manager sits, there’s no city manager so nobody is taking minutes. Therefore it’s just an illegal meeting. We are not going to tolerate decisions of an illegal meeting.” “We are a constitutional state and the mayor will be in his office and working. Whatever they try to do, we will do everything in our power which is legal to make sure that we stop them,” he adds. Meanwhile, DA Leader Mmusi Maimane and DA national chairperson, Athol Trollip, will address the media in Cape Town on Tuesday on the events that took place at the council meeting on Monday.
