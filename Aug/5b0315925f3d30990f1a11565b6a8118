Cyril Ramaphosa has assured United Kingdom Prime Minister Theresa May and her delegation that the issue of land expropriation is not an insurmountable problem. Ramaphosa and May have held a business roundtable discussion in Cape Town with delegations of business people and politicians. Speaking in Parliament earlier, May re-affirmed the UKâ€™s support for land reform in South Africa, as long as it is legal and carried out by a democratic process. Ramaphosa says as with Apartheid, the country will solve the issue of land expropriation without collapsing its economy. May is on a three-day working visit to Africa that will also include Kenya and Nigeria. She gave the South African delegation the assurance that the UK is committed to investing in the country and the continent both in the government and private sectors. Click video below:
