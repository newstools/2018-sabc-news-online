Residents of Reigerpark in Ramaphosa Informal Settlement, east of Johannesburg, have embarked on protests. Gauteng police say it is still unclear why the residents are protesting. Motorists are urged to avoid the area as traffic is severely affected. The Police’s Kay Makhubela says they will engage the community to try to find out what protesters want. He says the police are monitoring the situation as residents have barricaded the road. He says: “They are burning tyres and have put rocks and rubble on the street. No one has been reported injured or any malicious damage to property but we will continue monitoring the area and we will engage them as the day goes.”
