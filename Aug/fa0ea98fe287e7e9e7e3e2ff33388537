Police say it is now safe for motorists to use the R559 towards Protea Glen, south of Johannesburg. Earlier on Thursday morning, the route was closed due to protests. Locals were protesting against Eskom and what they termed ‘unfair treatment’ by the power utility. Residents say they have had power cuts and while some of them have paid for their electricity, it has still not been connected. “They had a meeting where they agreed that they have to open the road until tomorrow (Friday) when they will be given feedback from the authority. But at the moment, we are still trying to open the road. The motor vehicles which are coming towards Randfontein, they can start utilising that particular route,” says Police Spokesperson Kay Makhubela.
