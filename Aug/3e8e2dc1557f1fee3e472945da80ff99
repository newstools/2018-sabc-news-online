Zimbabweâ€™s President-elect Emmerson Mnangwagwa says opposition leader Tendai Biti was released following his intervention. Biti has been charged with unofficial or false declaration of election results and inciting violence. He was granted bail of $5 000 by a court in Harare and ordered to hand over the title deeds to his house. Six people were killed in Harare when the army fired live ammunition at rioters last week. The protesters were angry after the results of the parliamentary elections were announced. Mnangagwa says because of the serious nature of the allegations, due process will continue in the Biti matter. However, Mnangagwa also says he will strive for unity, peace and dialogue in Zimbabwe.
