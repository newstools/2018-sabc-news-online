There is a total shutdown in the rural town of Matatiele in the Eastern Cape. Bus stations and taxi ranks are closed and only a few vehicles are moving in and out of the town. Last week, residents embarked on a service delivery protest that turned violent. Three state vehicles and the Public Works office with important documents were torched. Roads and Transport MEC Weziwe Tikana is expected to address the protesters on Tuesday. All businesses are closed and there are no taxis or buses transporting commuters in and out of town. Just a few kilometres from Matatiele to Cedarville, a group of taxi operators are standing in the middle of the road stopping vehicles carrying passengers towards Kokstad. Police came in numbers to monitor the situation.
