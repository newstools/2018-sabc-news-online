The Buffalo City Metro kickstarted its Albertina Sisulu centenary celebrations in East London, Eastern Cape, by honouring long serving female nurses in the city. Albertina Sisulu was a nurse by trade. Thirty five nurses are honoured for their work and for going beyond the line of duty in serving patients. The first of many events by the Buffalo City metro to honour the life of Albertina Sisulu. BCM Mayor, Xola Phakathi, says they want to keep the memory of the struggle icon alive. He says Masisuluâ€™s contribution to the struggle is immeasurable. To honour her further, the metro says it wants to support the health department in improving the public health system.
