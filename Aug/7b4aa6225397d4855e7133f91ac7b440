The Department of Social Development says they are confident that by the 1 October the South Africa Social Security Agency (Sassa) will be ready to work with the South African Post Office (Sapo). The Constitutional Court’s extension of the contract between Sassa and Cash Paymaster Services (CPS) ends in September. Sassa says it has thus far successfully transferred 5.5-million grant beneficiaries from CPS to the Post Office. Social Development Minister Susan Shabangu says they are left with only 200 000 more beneficiaries to transfer. “We have successfully swooped 5.5 million beneficiaries and we are left with about 200 000 for us to completely swap them over to the Post Office. Our partnership with the Post Office is yielding results and the glitches we had beginning of July we have dealt with those challenges which were more of the network systems and we fixed that. Today we have overcome them. If you look at where we are and last month we made our payments in a smooth way.” Click below for more on the story:
