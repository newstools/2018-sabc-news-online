Striking Gautrain workers have rejected a new three year wage deal offered by the Bombela Operating Company. The United National Transport Union (UNTU) is still demanding among others, a 10% basic salary increase, housing and transport allowances. Before the new offer, Bombela had offered workers an 8.5% salary increase and other benefits. The strike, which entered its second week, has seen Gautrain operating a limited service. Negotiations are now being facilitated by the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA). UNTU Spokesperson Steve Harris says the strike continues. “The workers have rejected the offer and we are waiting for the CCMA to schedule another date for us to continue talks. It was a three year deal and this is the frustration that the employer is causing. Every time we get to the negotiations, there’s a new offer on the table. The people are not interested in a three year deal.  They are only interested in sharing in the incentives and profits and to have their basic salary increase,” says Harris.
