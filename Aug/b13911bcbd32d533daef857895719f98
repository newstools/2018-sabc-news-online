Thousands of applicants for next year’s grade one and eight in Gauteng public schools have been unsuccessful. The Gauteng Department of Education says over 90 000 applicants have not yet received school placements. The department says that it received over 280 000 applications by the end of May. The majority of these were for grade one learners. Of the 195 000 parents with offers, only 74 000 have accepted. Gauteng education says that 90 000 will have to wait until next week to receive their placements. Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi, says the placement offers will lapse after seven days, “Failure to respond to the offer of placement will result in the forfeiture of the offer to the next applicant on the waiting list.” “The department also says a child that has completed grade R in a particular school is not guaranteed a placement at the same school for grade one. It also says that where sibling enrollment was considered, there were no guarantees that siblings will be placed at the same school. Applicants and all those who could not be placed by schools due to capacity will be placed by districts,” says Lesufi. The department plans to have all grade one and eight learners placed by October 31. WATCH BELOW:
