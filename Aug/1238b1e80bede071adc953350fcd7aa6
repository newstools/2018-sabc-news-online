Former African National Congress (ANC) Member of Parliament Vytjie Mentor says she is looking forward to testifying before the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture on Monday. On Friday, former Deputy Finance Minister Mcebisi Jonas dropped a bombshell when he accused Major-General Zinhle Mnonopi of trying to deliberately sabotage the investigation into the Guptas’ alleged attempt to bribe him. Parliament’s Portfolio Committee on Police has since called for an urgent investigation into the Hawks. Mentor, who alleges that the Gupta family had offered her a cabinet post, says although she fought for the establishment of the commission, she does not take appearing before it lightly. “It’s nothing for one to beat their chest about. I am anxious, much as I know my truth because the commission is serious business and because it is the last hope to save the country from the mess. I’m happy that I’m able to play a role in that but I’m anxious.” Meanwhile, Hawks Spokesperson Hangwani Mulaudzi says their head Lieutenant-General Godfrey Lebeya is set to make an announcement on some of the submissions made at the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture possibly before the end of this week. Parliament’s Portfolio Committee on Police has since called for an urgent investigation into the Hawks. Mulaudzi says he wants to put it on record that Mnonopi is not being singled out. “Just because there are allegations that were made on Friday, I don’t think it would be fair to say that she is now being singled out for each and everything that might have happened within the environment itself. It is also not good to paint the organisation with the brush by saying that this is what might have transpired at that time.” Click below for more on the story:
