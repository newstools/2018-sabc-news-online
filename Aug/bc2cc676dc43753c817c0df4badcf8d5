The United Nations Security Council has welcomed steps taken recently in the electoral process in the Democratic Republic of Congo, particularly President Joseph Kabila‘s decision not to seek an additional term in office. The Council welcomed recent steps with the registration of candidates for the Presidential and legislative elections due on December 23 and President Kabila’s respect for his commitment to abide by the Congolese Constitution and the provisions of December 31, 2016 Political Agreement. In a statement, Council members underlined the importance of the entire Congolese political class and institutions charged with organising the poll remaining committed to a process that will lead to a peaceful transfer of power. They encouraged all Congolese stakeholders to create all necessary conditions to ensure an environment conducive to the conduct of political activities, to ensure that the elections take place with the requisite conditions of transparency, credibility and inclusivity, including the full and effective participation of women.
