EFF leader Julius Malema says the time has come for South Africa to pull out of the Commonwealth. He was commenting on the official visit by British Prime Minister Theresa May to the country on Tuesday. South Africa withdrew from the Commonwealth when it became a Republic in 1961, and then re-joined the group of mainly English-speaking nations after the advent of democracy in 1994. Malema gave his view for May’s reasons for visiting South Africa. “The EFF policy is that we must pull out of the Commonwealth. We can’t be participating on coloniser’s affairs. She is here to supervise and monitor the colony. She is not in hiding that she’s going to Cyril (Ramaphosa) about land. So Cyril is going to receive warnings, or here you must be very careful. At least she’s got the decency to come and whisper to Cyril’s ear and say, hey don’t do it,” says Malema. Watch related video below
