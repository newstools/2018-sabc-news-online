Deputy prosecutions boss Nomgcobo Jiba and her colleague Lawrence Mrwebi have until Friday to make submissions as to why they should not be suspended pending inquiries related to multiple court rulings against them. Earlier this month, president Cyril Ramaphosa said he intended to institute an inquiry into their fitness to hold office. Ramaphosa’s move followed the judgment of the High Court in Pretoria in December. It reviewed and set aside the decision taken by Jiba’s boss, Shaun Abrahams, to discontinue her prosecution for charging former KwaZulu-Natal Hawks head Johan Booysen with racketeering based on untrue statements. Former president Jacob Zuma’s decision not to act in terms of the NPA Act and suspend Jiba and Mrwebi pending inquiries into their fitness to hold their respective offices and to institute such inquiries was also reviewed and set aside.
