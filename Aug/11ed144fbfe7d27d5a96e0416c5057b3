The EFF in the Nelson Mandela Bay Metro has vowed to continue to push for a motion of no confidence in mayor Athol Trollip. He survived a third motion of no confidence from the opposition parties during a council meeting Thursday. It was expected to debate the motion tabled by the EFF but it collapsed before it started. Opposition parties argued that they received the agenda late. Regional chairperson of the EFF, Amandlangawethu Madaka says, “The EFF are fighters, we will fight till the end in a proper meeting that would be convened. We would debate our motions, we would vote, if we win, we win, if we lose, we lose. We comeback stronger but we would never abandoned this fight.” Watch related video:
