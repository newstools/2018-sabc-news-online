Police Minister Bheki Cele says they have managed to drastically reduce the number of cash-in-transit heists in the country. He says they have also arrested four of the 15 most wanted cash heist kingpins. Cele was speaking at the launch of the ‘Buya Mthetho’ crime fighting operation in Tembisa on Gauteng’s East Rand. “While I am satisfied with this progress, our fight with these criminals is not yet over,” says Cele. “From 15 April to 20 June, which is six weeks, cash in transit robberies have declined by 63%. If we give you raw figures, Gauteng always leads. Gauteng moved from 20 to seven.” Related video click below:
