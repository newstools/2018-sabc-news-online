Wednesday’s violence in Soweto ended in three deaths as protesters raided foreign-owned shops. Consumers believe that Spaza shop owners get their supplies from backyard factories where unhealthy food products are manufactured and sold to unsuspecting customers. The National Consumer Commission says it is working on a strategy to deal with allegations and the perpetrators. Head of Enforcement& Investigation at the National Consumer Commission Prudence Moilwa says, the Consumer Commission’s responsibility is to check  products with regards to their labeling as well as to check whether they have expired or not, “the situation in Soweto yesterday requires the intervention of the police not of the Commission.” Moilwa says the Commissions focus has not been on Spaza shops, “Our focus has been in the major towns and maybe small towns, Our focus has not been on Spaza shops.” Click link for full interview
