The Democratic Alliance is on Wednesday expected to hold a special sitting of its federal executive to consider the status of its coalition governments amid attempts by opposition parties to unseat it in two metros. The EFF, which voted for the DA-led coalition after 2016 local elections, wants mayor Solly Msimanga out citing alleged corruption in a R12 billion management contract. The EFF and the ANC have tabled two separate motions of no confidence in the mayor which are set to be heard on Thursday. DA leader Mmusi Maimane’s spokesperson, Portia Adams says Maimane will address the media following the special sitting of the party’s federal executive. Maimane will be joined by chair people of Gauteng including Tshwane Mayor Solly Msimanga.
