Political analyst Somadoda Fikeni says the current developments at the National Prosecuting Authority have badly affected its credibility and ability to fight serious crime. Deputy prosecutions boss Nomgcobo Jiba and her colleague Lawrence Mrwebi have until end of Friday to make submissions as to why they should not be suspended pending inquiries related to multiple court rulings against them. Earlier this month, President Cyril Ramaphosa said he intended to institute an inquiry into their fitness to hold office. Ramaphosa’s move followed the judgment of the High Court in Pretoria in December. It reviewed and set aside Jiba’s boss Shaun Abrahams’ decision to discontinue her prosecution for charging former KwaZulu-Natal Hawks head Johan Booysen with racketeering based on untrue statements. Fikeni says: “It has impacted on the NPA perception that the heads of the NPA were close to the political processes and therefore not just serving without fear, favour or prejudice which is the fundamental requirement for the NPA. Other people who were being subjected to processes were beginning to complain that the law is used against them, for political reasons.”
