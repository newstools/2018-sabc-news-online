Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba has welcomed more than 200 foreign nationals, who qualify for South African citizenship at a Naturalisation Ceremony in Durban. They have been introduced to the country’s symbols, constitution and the national anthem. Foreigners who left their countries for differing reasons, including wars, say they have found a place they can call home. They have been given a full right of citizenship and informed of the responsibilities that accompany such rights. Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba says international migration has become a prominent moral, political and economic issue. “In South Africa, we have articulated the view that international migration is a natural, human phenomenon, which can benefit our development, nation building and social cohesion if managed well. South Africa appreciates the importance of human connections in diversity. The very origins of our country make us appreciate the diversity of our nationhood.” Gigaba has called on the new citizens to embrace and adhere to the laws of this country. He has also encouraged South Africans to warmly welcome the new citizens into the country. “We cherish the concept of unity in diversity and believed that the concept can never be completed so long as human society itself continues to evolve. We are a country which values and practices the concept of Ubuntu.” One of the beneficiaries of the naturalisation process, Irene Naicker, is from England. She says applying for citizenship was no walk in the park, but worth the wait. The new citizens have been taken through an induction programme, where they learned about the country’s history as well as rights and responsibilities as citizens. Related video click below:
