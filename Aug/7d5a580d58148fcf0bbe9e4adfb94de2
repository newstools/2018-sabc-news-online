A R100 000 reward has been offered for information regarding the arson attacks on trains in Cape Town that could lead to the arrest and successful conviction of the perpetrators. The reward is being offered through the Western Cape’s Department of Community Safety. Western Cape Premier Helen Zille says arson damage to trains over the past four months has amounted to approximately R50 million and at least R210 million over the past five years. Her spokesperson, Marcellino Martin says Prasa requires 88 train sets to run an effective service and currently due to arson, cable theft and vandalism the available sets are down to below 40. He says: “This is of serious concern to us and this is why the organised criminal elements behind these attacks must be exposed.” “This is the reason why we are offering a reward of R100 000,” adds Martin.
