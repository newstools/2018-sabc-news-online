The Chairperson of the Faith for the Nation Campaign in Zimbabwe, Andrew Wutawunashe has requested that the opposition MDC-Alliance and its leader, Nelson Chamisa accept the olive branch that President Emmerson Mnangagwa has extended to him. Chamisa, and his supporters are boycotting the inauguration, as they believe Mnangagwa was unfairly elected and plan to challenge his victory in an African Union court. Wutawunashe says Chamisa should work with Mnangagwa to better the country. “This is a message we give to his worthy competitor, Nelson Chamisa to say please accept the hand of friendship that the president is offering because you will unite our nation. If you do not, it will be like helping to burn our house down. We therefore say, accept this hand of friendship and build the nation with our president,” says Wutawunashe. Click link for more
