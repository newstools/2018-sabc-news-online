Waste management company Pikitup says Johannesburg residents have embraced new recycling rules. The rules, which require residents to separate their refuse before collection, commenced on July 1. They come as the City is running out of landfill space. Pikitip spokesperson Muzi Mkhwanazi says in five to six years’ time the City might run out of landfill sites. Mkhwanazi says, “That means we won’t have space where we will deposit waste. The waste management act also requires us to look at alternatives means of disposing waste, ensuring that waste does not land on our landfill site. The strategy maintains that in 2040 at least 97% of all waste must not land up at landfill sites, only 3% of waste must land up there. “ He says, “Recycling is one of the means and ways which waste can be diverted away from landfill sites.” Mkhwanazi says, “If Johannesburg runs out of space, Pikitup might be forced to transport waste to nearby provinces and this will have financial implications. There will also be financial implications for residents if they don’t adhere to the rules.” “As Pikitup we are pleased that residents are proactive in terms of the separations of waste and they have actually embraced the concept of separation,” he adds.
