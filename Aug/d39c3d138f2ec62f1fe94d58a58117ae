A team of police officers has been deployed at Unity Secondary School in Daveyton on Gauteng’s Eastrand for the next three weeks. This follows an incident of mob justice at the school earlier this week which has left learners traumatized. It’s believed the community went on the rampage attacking suspected gang members believed to be terrorising the community. One person was killed, and another was set alight in front of learners and he’s being treated in hospital. Three people have since been arrested. The Gauteng Department of Community Safety has since deployed a contingent of police officers to monitor the school. MEC Sizakele Nkosi Maolobane says the move is to ensure learners’ safety and that teaching and learning goes ahead unhindered. Education MEC Panyaza lesufi has echoed the sentiments of MEC Malobone saying that the learners’ safety is their highest priority. The two held a press briefing in Johannesburg. Police officers have also been deployed across the community as a gang war is expected to take place on Friday. Watch for more:
