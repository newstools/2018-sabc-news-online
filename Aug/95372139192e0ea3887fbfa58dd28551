Amendments to Section 25 of the Constitution to allow for the expropriation of land without compensation could possibly be concluded before next year’s general elections. That’s according to Lewis Nzimande, one of the Co-Chairpersons of the Constitutional Review Committee, which held its last public hearings on the matter in Cape Town on Saturday. The African National Congress (ANC) in the Western Cape says the majority of people attending land hearings in the province have voiced their support for the amendment of Section 25 of the Constitution. Over 2000 people attended the last of the nationwide public hearings, held in Goodwood in Cape Town on Saturday. ANC President Cyril Ramaphosa announced last week that his party intended to change the constitution to enable the move. Parliament’s Constitutional Review Committee has concluded its hearings in all nine provinces to get the views of people on whether it should be changed. It has until the end of September to report  back to the National Assembly and the National Council of Provinces (NCOP) on the hearings and submissions the Committee had received.
