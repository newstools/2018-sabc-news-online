Four learners from Krugersdorp High School in Gauteng have won R10 000 each in the South African Reserve Bank (SARB) Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) Schools Challenge. Thabiso Rakometsi, Basi Segwagwe, Ndumiso Magwanya and Nathan Allum – all Grade 12 learners at the school – study economics as one of their subjects. It is the first time that the competition went national since its inception in 2012. Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga says such initiatives contribute to learners’ overall development. “We, as the Basic Education sector, value the pedagogical role played by these kinds of initiatives… Some researchers have touted role-played pedagogy as a means of increasing student’s motivation, engagements and confidence. “They also argue that it facilitates a deeper and more critical understanding of the course material … that [it] can be used to help students engage critically with course material taking into account deep meanings, social personal implications and social consequences,” says Motshekga.
