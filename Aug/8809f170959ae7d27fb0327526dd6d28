An attempt to stop the scheduled consultative conference of the Pan Africanist Congress of Azania (PAC) has been struck off the court roll. The case in the high court in Johannesburg is intended to stop the staging of  the conference in Kimberley over the weekend and has been launched by the current party president Narius Moloto. Moloto has accused disgruntled members of trying to undermine his authority and waging a campaign to destroy the party. In reply, the convenors of the conference to discuss the future of the PAC argued that they have a moral responsibility to ensure that the party is saved from further disintegration. The ruling in the South Gauteng High Court will pave the way for the staging of the conference over the weekend. WATCH BELOW:
