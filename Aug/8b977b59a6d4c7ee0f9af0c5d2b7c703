Black First Land First (BLF) leader Andile Mngxitama says they would like to see Duduzane Zuma make peace with the families of the victims of the 2014 car crash which claimed two lives. Mngxitama says this would be an African solution to an African problem. Zuma has been charged with two counts of culpable homicide following the fatal crash on the M1 highway in Johannesburg.  The case was postponed to October 26th  to allow Zuma’s lawyers time to prepare for trial. The matter is then expected to be transferred to the High Court. Former President Jacob Zuma was at court to support his son.   Mngxitama says Zuma will not receive a fair trial. “We have issued a very clear call to the families of those who passed on in this accident. That we must work together to find a solution, an African solution to an African problem. We’d like to hear what the families’ own demands and needs are, what kind of reparation is possible. You know we black people believe in reparations and a justice system which is not punitive that’s how we’ve related over the years and that’s how we managed to bring peace under difficult circumstances.” Click below for more on the story:
