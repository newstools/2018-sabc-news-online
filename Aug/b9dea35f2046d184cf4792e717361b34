Three taxi passengers have been killed after the taxi they were traveling in collided with a bus at the corner of Kgosi Mampuru and Madiba streets in Pretoria. Tshwane Metro Police Spokesperson Isaac Mahamba says the collision happened after the taxi’s brakes failed. Mahamba says more than 15 passengers who were critically injured were airlifted to local hospitals. Mahamba has urged motorists to avoid the affected roads as they remain closed. “It’s alleged that a taxi failed to break and collided with the bus. We can confirm at this stage that three people passed away on the scene and about 15 of them were critically injured and airlifted to the different hospital. At this stage, the roads remain closed while police are busy investigating the scene. And unfortunately, three of the people who died on the scene were all women and the driver of the bus was a lady as well.”
