South African Airways (SAA) has been moved back to the Department of Public Enterprises under Minister Pravin Gordhan. The finance ministry was previously responsible for SAA, which has not generated a profit since 2011. In a statement, the Treasury says the transfer of the national carrier follows the results of a study commissioned by both Treasury and Public Enterprises. The study found that government needed to develop an optimal group structure for the state-owned aviation assets and that Public Enterprises was deemed to be the best custodian of all the state aviation assets of SAA and its subsidiaries, Mango and SA Express.
