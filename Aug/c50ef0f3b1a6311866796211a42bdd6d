Management at the University of Venda in Thohoyandou says there must be an alternative system to resolve the non-payment of NSFAS allowances to students. Students at the university are boycotting classes after they did not receive allowances.  University spokesperson Takalani Dzaga says they are engaging NSFAS and the Department of Higher Education to cancel student allowances and replace them with a better system. “It is unfortunate that students took a decision to continue with the protest. The University of Venda is one of the institutions that are pilot project. Students have been indicating that the system is failing them we are trying our best to engage both the Department of Higher Education and Training and NSFAS to look at an alternative system for the disbandment of students’ allowances”. However, some students say they are ready to resume with lectures and to give management space to process payment of their allowances. “I wanted to attend and when I came to school I found that there’s no one here, in other words it means that we are not going to be taught.  It is not well on me because I can see that we are staying behind in terms of school work. On the other side, I didn’t get all my allowances, even from February I haven’t received any allowance here,” says a student.
