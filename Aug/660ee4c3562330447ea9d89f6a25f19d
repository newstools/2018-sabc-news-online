Zimbabwe’s Constitutional Court judgment on MDC Alliance leader Nelson Chamisa’s challenge to President Emmerson Mnangagwa’s victory in the July the 30th elections has been delayed. The court concluded its hearings on Wednesday. Chamisa’s lawyer, Thabani Mpofu, alleged that there was massive doctoring of the vote to keep Mnangagwa in office. Lawyers for Mnangagwa, his Zanu-PF party and the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC) rejected this. South African advocate, Dali Mpofu, has been giving Chamisa and the MDC-Alliance some legal advice. “All we want is that the voice of the people of Zimbabwe, whatever it is, it must be expressed. Because elections are an expression of the voice of the people. If it says Mnangagwa, well and good. If it says Chamisa, good luck to him. But that is what this court case is about – distilling the essence of what the people of Zimbabwe want and it is their choice.” WATCH RELATED VIDEO:
