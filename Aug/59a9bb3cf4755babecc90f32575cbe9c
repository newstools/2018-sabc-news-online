Eskom says there is a high risk of load shedding for the rest of this month. The power utility has urged consumers to use electricity sparingly. Eskom has been engaged in wage negotiations with workers’ unions the National Union of Mineworkers (Num), National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (Numsa) and Solidarity. Utility spokesperson Khulu Phasiwe says recovery teams will start work on the maintenance and restarting of power plants among other things. “We need to make sure that we resume our operations back to normalcy as soon as possible so hopefully starting from tonight (Friday) and over the weekend many of them will go back to their posts; and that process of making sure that everything is working according to order is going to take about a month. Therefore within that period there’ll always be a risk of load shedding.” Click below for more on the story:
