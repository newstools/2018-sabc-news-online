Rand Water says water in some of the affected areas in Johannesburg will be fully restored on Wednesday night. Residents in Johannesburg and surrounding areas, including Mogale City and Lenasia South have been without water since Tuesday. This after an explosion at Eikenhof substation led to a power outage and extensive water cuts. Hospitals and clinics, including old age homes have been affected. Some learners were also turned away from school today. The City of Johannesburg has offered R100 000 reward in connection with what it says was sabotage. Mayor Herman Mashaba says he is convinced from video footage that the fire started outside the Eikenhof substation and that someone used oil to start the blaze. He says law enforcement agencies are investigating the matter. Watch related videos below:
