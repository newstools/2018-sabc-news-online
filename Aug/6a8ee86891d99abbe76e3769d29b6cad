More than 40 000 Gauteng parents have forfeited their children’s placement offers for grade one and eight for 2019. Failing to meet last Friday’s deadline, they’re now at the mercy of the department. The new academic year is just five months away and scores of parents seem unperturbed. The department will now decide on their behalf. Fresh placement offers will be offered to parents who initially applied but received no offers. These applicants have a ‘pending’ status on their online profiles. Gauteng Department of Education spokesperson, Steve Mabona says, the department has already placed 163 000 pupils. “These parents must now make contact with the schools,” he said. The department says all applicants will be placed by October, many not in their preferred schools. A late application period will be announced.  Watch related videos below
