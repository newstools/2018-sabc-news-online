Investigations into companies linked to African National Congress (ANC) National spokesperson Pule Mabe that were paid R49 million by the provincial government, are at an advanced stage. This was revealed by North West Premier Job Mokgoro in Mahikeng on Saturday. Mabe is linked to a controversial awarding of a tender that was never advertised by the North West Development Cooperation, which is a subsidiary of the provincial government. The company linked to Mabe was established two months before it was awarded the multi-million contract. Several senior executives of the North West Development Corporation (NWDC), who signed off on the contract, have since been suspended. Mokgoro says, “I am in constant communication with law enforcement agencies, so I do not get peaceful sleep, until this matter is resolved. The process is currently under way, I cannot reveal much but let me assure you that we will leave no stone unturned. This Pule Mabe issue, the matter is receiving all attention including that of law enforcement agencies,”
