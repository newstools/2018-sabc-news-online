Agri Northern Cape says it is saddened and shocked by the sudden death of its president Henk van Wyk. He suffered a heart attack in his sleep. Van Wyk played a vital role in the agricultural sector in the whole country. Agri Northern Cape’s Vice President Nicol Jansen says Van Wyk’s passing is a huge loss to agriculture. “We want to give our condolences to the family. We are very thankful for the time that he could be active within organised agriculture, and we thank his family that they made him available to do this important work for the agricultural sector as a whole, but in the Northern Cape, specifically”.
