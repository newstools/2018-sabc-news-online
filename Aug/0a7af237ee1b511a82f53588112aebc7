Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema says politicians should not be exempt from the rule of law after AfriForum laid charges against him, regarding a video which apparently shows him firing shots into the air at an EFF event. Malema was addressing lawyers affiliated with the Limpopo Law Council, outside Polokwane. The Limpopo Law Society says part of the reason it invited Malema to address them, includes the profession’s need to embrace radical change. Most of Malema’s address focused on shaming public office bearers. He also touched on the importance of adhering to the rule of law under the judiciary. He however says the judiciary also stands to be questioned if it strays from the principles of the Constitution. “Justice must [not] be done only, it must be seen to be done and we need that type of rule of law if our democracy is going to succeed. Judiciary must never see who is in office, they must see the constitution and the facts, not faces of individuals, and otherwise we are finished.”   The Limpopo Law Council says most of its members welcomed the decision to have Malema address them. Its chairperson, Michelle Beatson says, the profession is going through a lot of changes and “we’ve had to ask ourselves a lot of deep questions as to where the profession is going in the future.” “Our structures that presently exist are going to change quite radically and as far as change and being vocal by saying exactly what you mean when you want to Mr. Malema is obviously the prime person to do that. He was at the LSNP’s AGM, he draws a lot of people because the attorneys are ready for change and they ask a larger number of questions, they are vital in our society to make radical decisions.”
