The High Court in Pretoria will deliver judgment on a couple in the so-called Springs monster trial on Thursday. The father from Springs is facing 22 charges, ranging from rape and child abuse, to the attempted murder of his then 11-year-old son. The mother is facing 20 charges, also relating to the alleged abuse and neglect of their five children. The mother earlier told the court that she was also a victim of her abusive husband, and that she was helpless to defend her children against him. However the State argues that the mother is also guilty, as she did not help her children.  The children are in a place of safety and neither of the parents have seen them since their arrest in 2014. They were rescued from the so-called ‘House of Horrors’ in Springs after the police were contacted by neighbours and raided the double storey house in Springs. This was after the couple’s then 11-year-old son ran to the neighbours for help, as his father had severely beaten him.
