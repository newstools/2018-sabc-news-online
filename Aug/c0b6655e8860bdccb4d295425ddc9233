The trial date of the case of Nigerian pastor Timothy Omotoso and two co-accused has been set to start on October 8th. Omotoso and his co-accused Zukiswa Sitho and Lusanda Solani made a brief appearance in the High Court in Port Elizabeth on Thursday. They are facing 63 charges, including human trafficking, racketeering, contraventions of the sexual offences act and rape. NPA spokesperson Tshepo Ndwalaza says they are ready for the trial, “We feel very good about the fact that we are here. We are prepared to go ahead with the case. It’s been very long and we have been trying by all means to see that everything is summed up. We are ready for trial and it is going to start in October till December. We believe that we are ready and we are set for that.” Omotoso has been an awaiting trial prisoner for the past year after several unsuccessful attempts to get bail. Some congregants in his church, the Jesus Dominion International Church, are expected to attend the case in support of the controversial pastor.
