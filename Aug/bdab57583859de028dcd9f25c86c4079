Pikitup services have been suspended in Soweto after employees were threatened with violence. A Pikitup truck was burnt in Diepkloof, Soweto, and another was stoned and damaged in the same area on Friday. The affected depots are Central Camp and Zondi, where violent protesters demand to be employed despite not meeting the employment criteria. Pikitup spokesperson Muzi Mkhwanazi says it’s still unclear when the services will be back on track. He says: “Pikitup has suspended some of its services due to the fact that its workers were threatened with violence and their lives were in danger. The affected depots are the central and Zondi depot which service mainly areas in Diepkloof Soweto including your Orlando West, Meadowlands and all the major areas in Soweto.”
