West Coast farmer and convicted murderer Martin Visser has been granted leave to appeal his conviction and sentence by the Western Cape High Court sitting in Vredendal. On Wednesday, Visser was sentenced to life imprisonment after he was convicted of the murder of farm worker Adam Pieterse. Thirty two-year-old Pieterse worked on a farm next to Visser’s father’s smallholding in Lutzville. Pieterse was beaten with a spade, dragged with a quadbike and buried behind Visser’s father’s smallholding in 2015. His body was recovered three weeks later. Visser was also sentenced to a further three and a half years in jail on two counts of assault. In handing down sentence, Judge Nathan Erasmus said Pieterse’s body was dumped in a shallow grave.
