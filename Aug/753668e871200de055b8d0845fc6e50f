The ANC in the Free State has distanced itself from the cash heist incident at a Bloemfontein filling station on Wednesday. It is reported that a vehicle belonging to the provincial party’s Deputy Chairperson, William Bulwane was allegedly used in the heist. Spokesperson Thabo Meeko says Bulwane took his car for repair to a panelbeater following an accident in May. The same vehicle was stopped in the city after Wednesday’s heist with no registration plates. Police found one R5 rifle, a pistol, rifle magazines, and an undisclosed amount of cash, all apparently related to the heist. The owners of the panelbeater have been arrested. Meeko says Bulwane is co-operating with the police. “There is no relationship between this incident and the recent incident where an employee at our head office is under questioning or is suspected. We want to welcome the fact that the deputy chair went to the police station, had discussions with the Hawks. Of course, the ANC will await the process of the law to take its course.”
