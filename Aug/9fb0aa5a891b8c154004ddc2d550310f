Home Affairs offices nationally are unable to assist clients with birth, marriage and death certificates as well as the application and collection of passports and smart ID cards. Home Affairs spokesperson, Thabo Mokgola, says a power failure has affected their delivery of services. “We are experiencing a systems down time due to power failure at SITA, which has affected all our offices across the country. This means that Home Affairs offices nation wide are unable to offer services such as applications for birth, marriages as well as death certificates. This would also include the application and collections of smart ID cards as well as passports. Our technicians as well as those from SITA are looking into the problem and we wish to offer our sincerest apologies to our clients. ” WATCH BELOW:
