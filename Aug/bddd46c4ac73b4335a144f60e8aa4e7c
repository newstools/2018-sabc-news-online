A new method of treating extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR TB) patients was launched at Campbell in the Northern Cape. Bedaquiline expansion TB treatment is an injection free method which will be administered to all newly diagnosed Drug Resistant TB patients in the province. Campbell was identified as a site to launch the new treatment, based on the size of its population, which is more than 3 000.  A large number of XDR TB patients was also diagnosed there. The Northern Cape Health Department says the new method will help to curb the number of defaulting patients, who fear the use of injections.  Health MEC, Fufe Makatong says before TB patients would complain about the pain from the injection and that she hopes now that they will be taking the pills, they will start taking their treatment religiously. The Campbell community welcomes the new treatment. Thirty-four year old Ettienne Baatjie who was on treatment for five years before being cured, admits to having had defaulted a number of times. “The journey from the first day was very difficult, but as it goes on when you get used to the treatment, it gets a little bit easier from onwards. At the moment I’m two and half years cured and I’m feeling great, like I’ve never been before.” The Department hopes the new method will also help to minimise the number of new infections.
