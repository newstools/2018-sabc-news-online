Environmental Affairs Minister, Edna Molewa, has handed over a R44 million asbestos-free block of classrooms and an eight kilometre tarred road to the Mafefe community in Limpopo. The old classrooms and an administration block were built out of asbestos material some years ago. Several people in the village suffer from asbestosis and related diseases due to asbestos mines which were operational in the area. Molewa says they’re trying to minimise the effects of asbestosis in the area. “We are still very very far. We are fighting. Even as we have done this road today the fact that there are still people who are inhaling is very worrying.”
