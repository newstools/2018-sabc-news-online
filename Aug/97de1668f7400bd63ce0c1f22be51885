Government has encouraged members of the public to submit comments on the recently released National Treasury report. The end of August is the deadline for the comments on the report which recommends that white bread, flour, cake flour, sanitary products, school uniforms and nappies be zero rated. The report was submitted to Finance Minister Nhlanhla Nene on Friday. Nene had appointed the panel that worked on the report after the announcement in the budget in February of the increase in the rate of value-added tax (VAT) from 14% to 15%, with effect from April the first. Calls are continuing for more items to be included on the list of recommended additions for VAT zero rating. Click video below:
