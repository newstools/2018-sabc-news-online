The Democratic Alliance(DA) leader Mmusi Maimane has addressed scores of party members and supporters outside the Sammy Marks Square in Tshwane. He says the two motions of no confidence that the African National Congress(ANC) and Economic Freedom Fighters(EFF) have brought to the council will fail. Maimane also says the no confidence in Msimanga is misplaced. Earlier, Msimanga said he was not disturbed by the pending motions. He says when they first came into power two years ago the city was bankrupt due to what he called the ANC’s maladministration and corruption. The council is scheduled to have two sittings, with the last one which will decide Msimanga’s future. Related Videos
