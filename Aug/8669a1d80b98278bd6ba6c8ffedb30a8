Members of the Great Kei forum in the Eastern Cape have vowed to make the Qumrha based Great Kei Municipality ungovernable if the municipality has accepted the withdrawal of the resignation letters of the five African National Congress (ANC) councillors. The councillors resigned early August in solidarity with sacked mayor Loyiso Tshetsha, but then retracted their resignation letters. On Monday, members of the forum disrupted a special council meeting scheduled to elect a mayor after it emerged that the five councillors would participate in the meeting. Forum spokesperson, Weaver Sinqana, says they took it upon themselves to disrupt the meeting that scheduled to sit on Monday. “We therefore took it to ourselves to disrupt the meeting that scheduled to sit on Monday, however; when we were there we saw councillors that resigned in that meeting. We then said this meeting cannot continue due the fact that Mr Tekile was not sworn in procedural and the community does not want the five councillors who resigned. “We then said we don’t have councillors and we don’t have a mayor”.
