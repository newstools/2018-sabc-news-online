Opposition parties in the Nelson Mandela Bay have petitioned the Speaker Jonathan Lawack to convene a Special Council Meeting to table a motion of no confidence against Mayor Athol Trollip next week Friday. The petition signed by 61 council members from Economic Freedom Fighters, African National Congress, African Independent Congress, Patriotic Alliance and United Front follows Thursday’s meeting between the national leaders of these parties to discuss possible coalition government in the Metro amongst them. Trollip survived another motion of no confidence which was tabled by the EFF in May after he was saved by Patriotic Alliance Marlon Daniels’ vote. This time around it is the same Daniels that is tabling the motion. AIC Councillor Tshonono Buyeye is the seconder of the motion. “The issue where we feel people are being penalised double for instance if you owe this municipality they cut off your electricity. Once you pay them you still have to pay a re-connection fee and to us that is just unfair because we don’t know what is the re-connection for. The debt of our people is just increasing.”
