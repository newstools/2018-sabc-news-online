The department of Environmental Affairs says it is concerned about an increase in elephant poaching – mostly in the Kruger National Park. Officials briefed Parliament on efforts to curb rhino poaching and wildlife trafficking. The department’s Chief Director of Enforcement, Frances Craigie, says the poaching of elephants has increased from 24 in 2015 to 67 in 2017. “I think what is a concern is that the cases successfully prosecuted, you can see are zero. They made three arrests for elephant poaching this year. But there is still a lot of work to do.” Related video click below:
