The trial of a man accused of killing his former girlfriend at Phadzima outside Louis Trichardt two years ago is starting on Monday at Sibasa Regional Court near Thohoyandou. Rodney Tshivhula was the last person seen with 25-year-old Suzan Mabala before she disappeared. Mabala’s disappearance led to a community protest demanding Tshivhula’s arrest in 2016. They also wanted Tshivhula to reveal Mabala’s whereabouts. Tshivhula allegedly met Mabala on the day of her disappearance to discuss issues around their child. The Vhulaudzi police station and two police vans were burnt during the protest. Mabala’s decomposed body was discovered after a month. Her remains have not yet been buried as the family wants more suspects to be arrested before they bury her.
