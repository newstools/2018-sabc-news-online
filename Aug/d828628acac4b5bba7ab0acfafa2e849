ANC president Cyril Ramaphosa and some NEC members have arrived at the Rustenburg Civic Centre, in Bojanala region, where the party is expected to consult with branches in Rustenburg in the North West. Bojanala is the party’s biggest region, is among three of the four that has failed to hold its conferences in the province. This is due to continued factions, and allegations of Provincial Executive Committee led by chairperson Supra Mahumapelo, establishing parallel structures in the region. Hundreds of ANC members are singing Pro-Jacob Zuma songs, while others are singing President Ramaphosa’s name. Bojanala region is currently led by a Regional Task Team after its conference was nullified by the court. Ramaphosa has told hundreds of ANC members in Bojanala in North West, that the national leadership was there to attend to their concerns. This was as he was attempting to calm an unruly group attending a meeting in Rustenburg. Ramaphosa was flanked by National Working Committee members (NWC), ANC Youth League president Collen Maine, Zizi Kodwa and ANC North West Chairperson Supra Mahumapelo. Mahumapelo was earlier booed when he also tried to calm the disruptive members. In a meeting, the media was told to leave Ramaphosa. “This meeting will be followed up by the meeting of NWC in Mafikeng, with the PEC of the ANC in the North West. Today, we have called you as the branches of the ANC here. We held a very disruptive meeting, and we did not manage to hold the views of the members in Bojanala. Each time we face challenges, we go to the ground.”
