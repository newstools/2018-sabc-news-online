South African Advocates, Dali Mpofu and Tembeka Ngcukaitobi, are set to represent Zimbabwe’s opposition MDC Alliance and its leader, Nelson Chamisa, in their election court challenge on Wednesday. Zimbabwe’s Constitutional Court is to hear the case brought by Chamisa and the MDC against the recent election result. The Zimbabwe Electoral Commission announced in July that the vote had been won by incumbent President, Emmerson Mnangagwa, and his Zanu-PF party. But Chamisa and the MDC claim there were irregularities. The South African lawyers were waiting for permission from Zimbabwe’s Minister of Justice to work in that country. MDC Alliance Spokesperson Nkululeko Sibanda says this has now been granted. “They have accreditation. That’s all that really matters. There are five lawyers here, six actually, and they are not all going to speak to the judge, unless one of them is going to speak to the judge … that is the situation anyway; one person speaks at a time.” Click below for more on the story:
