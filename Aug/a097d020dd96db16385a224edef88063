Mathole Motshekga is no longer the chairperson of Parliament’s Portfolio Committee on Justice and Correctional Services. The committee says it is now battling with how to proceed with the Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane’s response to whether she is fit to hold office. The inquiry was expected to start at 10 o clock. Members had to elect a temporary chairperson in the absence of Motshekga but could not do so as members. Motshekga is no longer a member of the committee and therefore can no longer be chairperson. He can also not delegate a chairperson. Committee members have been battling with these issues. The members are battling to agree on the rules to elect an interim committee chairperson to proceed. They had to adjourn the meeting for a short while and indicated that they may have to get legal advice from Parliament on how to proceed.
