Two major roads that connect busy towns in Limpopo remain inaccessible due to service delivery protests. Residents of Malebogo have barricaded the road between Senwabarwana and My Darling for the fourth day. They are demanding that a 12 kilometre stretch of road be tarred. In another instance, residents of Chavani village have blockaded the road between Giyani and Elim. They are complaining about the high crime rate and a shortage of police officers. Traffic spokesperson, Matome Moremi-Taueatsoala has advised motorists to use alternative routes. She says: “We have received reports that there is a protest between Elin and Giyani. It is not clear on what the protest is about but we want to advice our motorists to avoid using the stretch of road because it’s covered with stones and burning tyres.”
