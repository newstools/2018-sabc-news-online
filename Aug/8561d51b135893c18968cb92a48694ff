EFF deputy president Floyd Shivambu has appeared briefly in the Wynburg Magistrates Court in the Free State on a speeding charge. The case has been postponed to the 21st of next month to allow Shivambu to get legal representation. Shivambu was arrested on the N1 at Winburg last Friday. Police say he was driving at 182 kilometres per hour in a 120 zone. He was released on R2000 bail. Shivambu was accompanied in court today by EFF Member of Parliament Fana Mokoena.
