The proposer of the historic 1956 Womens’ March should be given due recognition. That is the view of one of the few remaining organisers of that march Sophie De Bruyn. She says the proposer of the march, Margaret Gazo is virtually forgotten. De Bruyn led women in Ekurhuleni to remember four stalwarts from that region as Women’s Month begins. Invoking the spirit of the 20 000 fearless women of 1956. But the person who proposed the march remains virtually unknown. “She stood up and said why don’t we do what Black Sash did and march to the union buildings and that was Margaret Gazo, we agreed with her.” De Bruyn who was only 18 at the time, wants more recognition for Margaret Gazo who would have been 100 on Sunday. “As we celebrate her legacy as the province, we will declare her grave a heritage site and name a square after her and put up her statue at the women’s memorial in Pretoria,” says Gauteng Arts MEC Faith Mazibuko. Ekurhuleni also remembered Bertha Gxowa, Mary Moodley and Adelaide Tambo. On the 9 August a national holiday the country celebrates its women. WATCH BELOW:
