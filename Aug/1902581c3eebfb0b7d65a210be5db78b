Senior Manager for High Value Debt at the South African Revenue Services (Sars) Dion Nannoolal says inefficiencies caused by the restructuring project introduced by the revenue collector’s suspended Commissioner Tom Moyane resulted in the delay of enforcement actions on non-compliant taxpayers. Nannoolal is testifying at the Sars Inquiry which is looking into governance issues at the revenue services, chaired by retired Judge Robert Nugent. Nannoolal’s unit at Sars deals with highly sensitive cases ranging from international investigations into drug lords, to high-profile media personalities. “Just to give you a high level overview, in the past we could have brought a preservation order on a group of companies with four or five signatures and now we need anything from eight or twelve signatures. So now we’ve lost possibly hundreds of millions of rand in the last few years because of these inefficiencies.” Earlier, Senior Specialist for Legal Counsel at Sars, Pieter Engelbrecht said in the past couple of years he has been the subject of a number of internal investigations which he says were raised in an effort to get rid of him. Before suspended Sars Commissioner Moyane’s restructuring project at Sars, Engelbrecht said he headed a unit that dealt with executing cases of organised crime, high net-worth individuals and illicit financial flows.
