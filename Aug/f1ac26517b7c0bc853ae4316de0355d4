Public Protector, Advocate Busisiwe Mkhwebane, has urged government and municipal officials to respond to service delivery concerns timeously and adequately to avoid protests. She requested government officials to form structures to address complaints.  This would avoid the referral of minor ones to her office. Advocate Mkhwebane is on a  day visit to the North West. On Friday, she met senior government and municipal officials to deal with over two thousand service delivery complaints. “With the stakeholders I am encouraging them today to establish efficient complaints mechanisms, it doesn’t mean that they have to have a whole structure like the ombudsman in city of Joburg. You can have an official who is responsible for that so that when members of public complain you can assist them and speedily resolve their complaints,” she said. Mkhwebane also defended her alleged failure to appear before Parliament’s Justice portfolio committee. ” It was not a none appearance I have indicated in the statement I have issued that the portfolio committee secretariat requested me to respond in writing in fact that’s what they agreed on that they will request me to respond in writing on the allegations of the DA. Indeed I responded.” On the other hand, while officials concede there’s a need for stricter accountability, some point to budgetary limitations as a major hurdle in forming structures to address the growing number of service delivery complaints.
