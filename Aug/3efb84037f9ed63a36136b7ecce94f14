Finance Minister Nhlanhla Nene says suspended South African Reserve Service (SARS) Commissioner Tom Moyane was too pre-occupied with issues around the so-called ‘rogue unit’. Nene says he established the Kroon commission, chaired by retired judge Frank Kroon, in 2015 in a desperate attempt to fix the problems at SARS. Nene told the SARS inquiry underway in Pretoria about his relations with Moyane at the time. “In the period that I worked with the commissioner, we had a number of issues to deal with and I reached a point, there were some instances, like I said, I ended up having to appoint the Kroon commission because I felt that the Commissioner was paying too much attention to the so called rogue unit rather than focusing on the revenue collection… which is the core function. But I think that we handled that matter quite maturely – but I continued to have my reservations in terms of, from time to time, having to call the Commissioner to order, in order to focus on the revenue collection.” Click link for more:
