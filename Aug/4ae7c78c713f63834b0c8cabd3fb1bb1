The Democratic Alliance (DA) in Mpumalanga intends to write to Parliament to request to have the African National Congress (ANC) -governed Lekwa and Govan Mbeki Municipalities in the province summoned. This follows an oversight inspection by the party following what they term “the failed housing projects” under the two municipalities in the province. DA National Spokesperson and Shadow Minister of Human Settlements, Solly Malatsi states that they received reports from a colleague during the house-to-house campaign that people are living in undignified conditions and the delivery of sanitation services has completely collapsed. “We made various stops across different municipalities. Panorama section is one of the places we visited, and that is where we made some discoveries”. Malatsi says the area has neither proper sanitation nor running water. “Citizens rely on a truck that brings water once or twice a week and they have to pay for it. That is sad, because people from the area are unemployed and depend on social grants.” The DA in the province further claims there are allegations that the rightful housing beneficiaries have been left stranded while their houses are being occupied by people who bought them. “We discovered that there is corruption within the municipality and the political officials when it comes to allocating houses. Some of the people who are in the municipality system did not get their houses as they we given to other people,” says Malatsi. He also adds that in Govan Mbeki, the construction of RDP houses is set to commence soon; however, there is no official beneficiaries list. According to Malatsi, the party might protest to the municipalities.
