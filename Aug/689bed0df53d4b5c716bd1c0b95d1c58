The Hawks say their head Lieutenant-General Godfrey Lebeya will make an announcement on some of the submissions made at the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture possibly before the end of next week. This comes after former Deputy Finance Minister Mcebisi Jonas dropped a bombshell when he accused Major-General Zinhle Mnonopi of trying to deliberately sabotage the investigation into the Guptas’ alleged attempt to bribe him. Parliament’s Portfolio Committee on Police has since called for an urgent investigation into the Hawks. Hawks spokesperson Hangwani Mulaudzi says they view the matter in a serious light. “Lieutenant-General Lebeya has committed himself, together with his office, in terms of making sure that they investigate these allegations. We are of the view that serious action has to be taken within the confines of the law. We are just waiting for the national head himself to make an announcement, hopefully before the end of next week, as to what action is going to be taken. We cannot allow a situation that will dampen the integrity of the DPCI (Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation).” Click below for more on the story:
