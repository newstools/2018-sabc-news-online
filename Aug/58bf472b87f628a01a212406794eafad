The trial of Siyanda Gxwati, the man accused of killing his ex-girlfriend Refilwe Letebele in January, is expected to start in the Kimberley High Court on Monday. Gxwati who faces murder charges allegedly stabbed Letebele to death at her home and also stabbed and injured himself. Members of the Rise Abafazi Movement (RAM), an organisation opposed to Gender Based Violence, will picket outside court. Founder of the movement Mpho Assegai says, “We as the Rise Abafazi Movement will be going to the high court to first and foremost support the Letebele family. Secondly we want to see justice served.  The accused Siyanda Gxwati should pay for what he did, he played god with someone’s life he deserves to get the full punishment of the law.” “Harsher sentences should be given to perpetrators of murder, child molestation and rape,” adds Assegai.
