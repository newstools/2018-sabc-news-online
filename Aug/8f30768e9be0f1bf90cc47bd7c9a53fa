The murder case against four men accused of killing a 13-year-old girl Gabisile Shabane with albinism is on Tuesday expected to continue at the Witbank Magistrate’s court in Mpumalanga. Shabane was killed together with her one-year-old cousin, Nkosikhona Mgwenya, who was mistaken for her sibling with albinism in January this year. A Sangoma, Thokozani Msibi, together with his co-accuse Mthobisi Mkhize, Themba Thubane and Knowledge Mhlanga were then arrested a week after the incident. Shabane and  Ngwenya were attacked and kidnapped at their home in Vosman outside Emalahleni in January. Her body was later found buried in a shallow grave at Kwamhlanga, while Ngwenya’s body was retrieved from a stream in Emalahleni. The four men were arrested and charged with kidnapping, murder, conspiracy to commit murder and violation of a corpse. It is alleged that the suspects forced Shabane to drink beer mixed with brake fluid before she was killed. All suspects remain in custody. Related videos
