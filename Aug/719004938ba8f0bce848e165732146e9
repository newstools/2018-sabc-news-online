President Cyril Ramaphosa says a war is being waged against women’s freedom and safety in South Africa as many are subjected to emotional and physical abuse. He was giving the keynote address at National Women’s Day celebrations in Paarl in the Western Cape. Ramaphosa has warned men that they should not seek to dominate women. He says despite the progress that has been made, South Africa has not yet fully emerged from its racist and patriarchal past. He says: “Many South African women are still burdened by poverty and oppressed by cultural practices, social convention and prejudice. The face of poverty and suffering in our country is still worn by the women of South Africa.” “We men must get it into our heads that we do not own women nor do we own their bodies and that we should never seek to dominate them,” adds Ramaphosa.
