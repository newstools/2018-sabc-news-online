Defeated Zimbabwe opposition leader Nelson Chamisa has ruled out working with Zanu-PF in a coalition or government of national unity. His party Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) Alliance has decided to file a petition with the African Commission on Human and People’s rights, maintaining the July 30 elections were rigged. The killing of six people in recent protests in Harare remains unresolved. “That was not our demonstrations, ours have thousands. In terms of August 1 incident, it is clear that it was an illegal act, whoever was violent, that was unacceptable, but police were supposed to kick in but you don’t choose your supporters,” says Chamisa. In spite of the Constitutional Court ruling that declared President Emmerson Mnangagwa the winner of the presidential elections and Mnangagwa extending an olive branch, Chamisa is not accepting it. He says dialogue and cooperation are important but they must be based on truth, not deception and falsehoods. He accuses Mnangagwa of cheating the whole world. “People are actually saying Mr Chamisa don’t work with these people, don’t join hands with the crocodile, he will drown you. Look at what happened to Mr Tsvingirai, he was diluted, we were diluted and ended up being manipulated out of government, we don’t want positions, we want alternative government.” Click below for more on the story:
