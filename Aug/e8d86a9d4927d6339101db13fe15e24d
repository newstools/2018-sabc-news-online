There is a need to empower women as the majority still remain the face of poverty and inequality. This was the message during the African National Congress Women’s League’s (ANCWL) Gauteng 2018 Elective Conference in Pretoria. The top five has been successfully elected when branches from five regions assembled. The land issue and high levels of poverty among women were under the spotlight. “We think it is going to come up with very good resolutions around the matters as I indicated, because one of the issues that the conference is tasked to look at is the issue of land because land for women is not just about ownership,” ANCWL National Spokesperson, Thokozile Xasa. She, however, has cut to the chase on the issue of a presidential pardon for Fees Must Fall students facing criminal charges. “In any demonstration for whatever … we cannot support destructive measures, where they destroy the university they still want to study in; they destroy libraries; they put people’s lives at risk … that one, we cannot support.” Xasa says the processes of law have to be followed before one can be pardoned as is the case with every citizen. Meanwhile, student’s activist, Bonginkosi Khanyile who has been staging a sleep-out at the Union Buildings is expected to have a briefing with the Justice Minister on Monday. Khanyile, who is still outside the Union Buildings in Pretoria, says he hopes Sunday’s sleep over will be his last. Justice Minister Michael Masutha is yet to confirm his highly-anticipated meeting with Khanyile on MOnday. Khanyile, who arrived at the Union Buildings last Tuesday, says he’s optimistic that Masutha will stick to the plan he presented to them as the way forward. Khanyile has thanked the residents of Tshwane for their support after receiving a tent, blankets and a mobile toilet.
