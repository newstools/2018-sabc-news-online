Democratic Alliance (DA) Leader, Mmusi Maimane, together with DA national chairperson, Athol Trollip will on Tuesday meet in Cape Town, and address the media on Monday’s events in the Nelson Mandela Bay Metro. They will announce how the DA will fight the return of the Metro to an ANC-EFF coalition. This followed a day where speaker Johnathan Lawack was voted out by one vote. It was the result of a DA councillor who abstained to vote against the motion of no confidence against the speaker. This also resulted in the removal of Trollip as Mayor in absentia. He was replaced by Mongameli Bobani from the UDM. Bobani was unanimously elected in a council meeting that was dominated by adjournments in Port Elizabeth. DA councillors and its coalition partners Cope and ACDP walked out of the meeting saying the sitting was illegal. DA provincial leader Nqaba Bhanga says Athol Trollip will continue with his duties as the mayor of Nelson Mandela Bay. “What we will do is that we are going to go to the office tomorrow, the mayor will go to office and do our work. All those that try to obstruct us in delivering service to the people we will use the constitution. To make sure the institutions of our country and our democracy are able to intervene. We are not going to give up on this.” Bobani has promised to accelerate service delivery in the Metro, and says the new coalition will work as a collective. “The former Mayor was just doing things alone without even the collective. This particular government is going to work as a collective government we are going to include all our stakeholders. The mayor is just going to be the spokesperson of this collective and this is how things must go. This government our interest is within our people.” Watch video for more:
