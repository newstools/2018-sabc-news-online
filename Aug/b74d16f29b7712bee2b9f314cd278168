Oppsition MDC Alliance leader Nelson Chamisa and his supporters are expected to boycott the ceremony, as they believe President Emmerson Mnangagwa was unfairly elected and plan to challenge his victory in an African Union court. Long queues have formed at Harare’s National Stadium, as Zimbabweans flock to attend  Mnangagwa’s inauguration. The ceremony is due to start at half-past ten. These Zanu-PF supporters say they are happy with Mnangagwa’s leadership. “Today we need our president to advise people.  I feel that I don’t want elections, I want Zanu-PF to rule forever and we need opposition party leaders to be with the country. We don’t want elections,” says Zanu-PF supporter. One of the supporters says he has come to celebrate all the way from Plumtree, “Mnangagwa has done a lot for them. Water is a scarce resource but he’s built a lot of boreholes there and he’s been giving them flour.” Click link for more
