The National Student Financial Aid Scheme’s(NSFAS) new funding cycle for 2019 will be opened at the beginning of September. This was revealed by the Deputy Director for Universities at the Higher Education Department, Dianne Parker. She was briefing Parliament’s Higher Education and Training Committee. The department was one of the stakeholders that the committee had called to brief it about the current challenges the fund is facing. Minister Naledi Pandor had put the 2019 NSFAS applications on hold pending an investigation into the NSFAS system. “The 2019 applications will be opened in early September 2018. We are clear on that. We are committed to that, but we have to have an effective plan in place for delivering student financial aid and that will involve both NSFAS and institutions working very closely together. “We don’t think it’s going to be a very simple matter of fixing the system and getting an IT integration solution right now. That is going to the longer term process after this really deep investigation of the model and how it should work, and recommendations on that process.”
