KwaZulu-Natal MEC for Economic Development, Sihle Zikalala, says he is putting in place measures to curb consumer rights violations in the province. These include dealing with unscrupulous traders who exploit desperate consumers. Zikalala says they have conducted raids in the province and discovered counterfeit foods and other illegal goods. “We’ve taken upon ourselves to ensure that we go all over in the province to ensure that we inspect these areas and close those that are not operating illegally and those that are expired stuff. We have also identified a number of shops that are using the fast consumable goods such as food in particular. They sell expired food and we have collected all of that stuff and put it aside because it can’t be sold to people.  “
