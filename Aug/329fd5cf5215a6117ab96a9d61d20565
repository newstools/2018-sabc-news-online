The Johannesburg waste management company, Pikitup, say there is a process underway to employ former Jozi@work workers and Pikitup employees. The company says workers will be notified once the process has been completed. The disgruntled former contract employees staged a protest outside the SABC in Auckland Park, Johannesburg demanding that the city’s mayor, Herman Mashaba address the matter. Pikitup spokesperson, Muzi Mkwanazi says, “We are alarmed as Pikitup that former Jozi@work and contact employees as you alleged have protested outside the SABC offices. There is a process we have undertaken, and the process is not complete. The process to employ them is not complete. And it carries on even today… so we are alarmed as Pikitup, why they should go to that extent.”
