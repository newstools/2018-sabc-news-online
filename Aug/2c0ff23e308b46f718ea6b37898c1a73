Social Development Minister Susan Shabangu has again denounced Cash Paymaster Services‘ (CPS) apparent resistance to South Africa Social Security Agency’s (Sassa) long-awaited migration of beneficiaries to the South African Post Office. This is as the CPS contract with Sassa ends in September as determined by the Constitutional Court. Earlier in August, Sassa said there were no major challenges experienced in August in the payment of beneficiaries compared to July. However, many grant recipients are still reliant on the cash grant method. “I’m not even hearing from other people. I’ve experienced it myself as CPS people are trying to recruit people on the green cards and some in Evaton at the beginning of the month, elderly people literally crying saying they are unable to get their money and being told ‘you must leave this Sassa thing. Go and get a green card from Cambridge.’ So, these are some of the obstacles.” Shabangu says they will completely cut ties with CPS by the end of September. “CPS is aware it is not us. It is the court’s decision, but also it’s the behaviour where you find beneficiaries are not getting all their monies. There’s also an issue of loans given to elderly people. So, all these matters are clearly intending to distract us from the focus, but we need to make sure this time we don’t fail our people … we don’t fail our country, but also, we respect the law of our country and I’m confident that we are on the right track.” Click below for more on the story:
