The African National Congress (ANC) NEC is pinning its hope on the political induction held in East London to unite the largely divided province. The induction started ahead of the two day lekgotla starting on Saturday. The mother body is battling to unite the ANC in the province following its chaotic provincial elective conference in September last year. The ANC provincial lekgotla is seeking solutions for unemployment, poverty and inequality. But it must first deal with the elephant in the room. Tensions and divisions are among the ANC leadership following the September conference. ANC NEC member Nomvula Mokonyane says: “There is no denying that there are divisions in the province, that is why they are holding this lekgotla. Because political education will make sure that the leaders elected will know that they have a duty of leading even those that did not elect them.” A number of municipalities in the province are struggling financially and services have collapsed. “What is important now is to put more money for rural development because these municipalities are in the rural parts of the province where people are not employed and there’s no tax revenue,” adds Mokonyane. The ANC says the people of the Metro must decide who they want to lead them.
