President Cyril Ramaphosa has called on all those involved in the developments happening in Zimbabwe following the general elections last month to wait for due processes to take place. Ramaphosa says democracy is at play when opposition parties are allowed to exercise their right to challenge the outcomes of elections if there are some disputes. His comments come after Zimbabwe’s MDC Alliance leader Nelson Chamisa filed papers in the Zimbabwe High Court in Harare, disputing the legitimacy of the election results. Zimbabwe’s president-elect Emmerson Mnangagwa’s inauguration was due to take place on Sunday, but has since been put on hold. Ramaphosa says: “What I think we must all be pleased about is that things will be held in terms of the law and judicial processes and we must wait for that. Any party that contests the outcome of the elections must follow due process and it appears that is being done and now we call upon everyone to await the outcome of that whole process.” Watch the video below for related news:
