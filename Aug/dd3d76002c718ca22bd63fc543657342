The Police Ministry has come out strongly against the killing of Tshwane University of Technology (TUT) student Katlego Monareng, allegedly at the hands of police. The Centre for the Study of Violence and Reconciliation however says there’s little chance that officers found guilty will account for the death of Monareng. Speaking to SABC News,  Dr Hugo van der Merve said police still lack proper leadership engagement on how to deal with protests. Deputy Police Minister, Bongani Mkongi says he does not understand when there is a peaceful protest why police will deploy people with R5 rifles and dogs , “we received post-mortem result and we found that it was really an R5 rifle” Mkongi says the police officers deployed during TUT protest received orders from the station commander to use live ammunition on the protesting students.
