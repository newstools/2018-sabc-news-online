Residents of the Kensington area near Goodwood in Cape Town have placed boulders in Voortrekker Road causing major peak-hour traffic chaos. They are protesting against gang violence in the area. The residents say police resources are inadequate to deal with the scourge of gang killings that have hit the area. A resident, who only identified herself as Alicia, says they are demanding visible policing for starters. “When the police are here we are fine but there are just not enough resources. When we phone our local police station there are never enough vans. Police come hours later when something has already happened. Today they are here in their numbers so why do they not come out when we need them,” says Alicia. Meanwhile, the road has been cordoned off by police and traffic authorities are also on the scene. Voortrekker Road is a major thoroughfare linking Cape Town’s northern suburbs with the city centre. Traffic officials say Voortrekker Road has been closed between Jakes Gerwel and Pretige road in Kensington. Traffic spokesperson, Maxine Bezuidenhout says the road is also closed at Third Avenue allowing no traffic over the railway bridge in Salt River. Traffic officials are diverting motorists.
