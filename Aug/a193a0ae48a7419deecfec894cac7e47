South Africa’s buy local advocacy organisation, Proudly South African, has launched its own online shopping site. The company, which encourages South Africans to support local entrepreneurs, says there is a high demand for locally produced goods and products. While primarily serving South African citizens, Proudly South African also hopes there will be interest from international shoppers. “The products that are on offer will be exclusively produced by South Africans. We heeded the call of South Africans in general, who say to us, for convenience purposes and also to know which products out there are proudly South African, how do we get them and how do we then buy them online,” says Chief Financial Officer Happy Ngidi.
