Zanu-PF is still enjoying the leading position as the announcement of the Zimbabwe election results continues. So far Zanu-PF has won 73 constituencies with the MDC Alliance sitting at 28 and the NPF trailing with one seat. The vast majority of constituencies in the rural provinces of Mashonaland East, West and Central have been captured by Zanu-PF. The party has also been doing well in the Midlands province which boasted a high voter turnout of 75%. In the provinces of Matebeleland, the MDC Alliance has been able to score gains. However, there may be signs that the split within the MDC may cost the party in Nkai South Constituency. Zanu-PF surged ahead beating the two MDC factions, who combined would have won the day. Zimbabwe’s national assembly is made of 210 seats and counting is continuing as the ballot papers trickle in. Meanwhile, the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission has urged citizens not to take seriously announcements made on “social media” as they are not legitimate. Related video:
