Trade union Nehawu has welcomed the resignation of Sizwe Nxasana from the National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) describing him as a bad administrator. On Thursday Nxasana confirmed he has resigned from the organisation . In a statement, he says he informed Higher Education Minister Naledi Pandor of his resignation on Monday and offered his support to ensure an orderly handover process. NSFAS has come under fire after Minister Pandor instructed the scheme to halt funding for 2019 students because of a backlog in disbursing aid for 2017 and this year. NEHAWU general-secretary Zola Saphetha says Nxasana should now explain what has been happening at NSFAS. “We also call him to be available for questions that need to be answered and to be able to clarify the establishment of a student’s loan scheme with a direct link to Absa and Standard Bank, through an institution that’s supposed to subsidise free education.” Listen to the SA fm interview for more: <a href="https://iono.fm/e/590804">Content hosted by iono.fm</a> On Social Media, many have shared their views on Nxasana’s resignation.
