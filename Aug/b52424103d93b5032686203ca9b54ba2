Eight people have been killed and about 30 others injured in a bus crash near Beaufort West in the Karoo. Western Cape Traffic Chief Kenny Africa says the death toll could rise as there are still passengers trapped underneath the wreckage. Emergency and rescue workers are on the scene while traffic officials are re-directing traffic from the crash site. The crash occurred on Thursday morning about 50 kilometres from Beaufort West. Africa says the bus was travelling from Cape Town and was going in the direction of Beaufort West.
