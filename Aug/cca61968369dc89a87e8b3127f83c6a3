The Hawks have arrested five people for fraud and corruption in Delmas, Mpumalanga. The officials are accused of selling driver’s licenses. At Victor Khanye Municipality, aspirant drivers were charged R12 000 to obtain a driver’s license without going through the testing procedure. The Hawks arrested municipal officials and driving school operators. Road Traffic Management Simon Zwane says:”We have been investigating fraud in the department, issuing of code 14 driver licences. The information we had indicated that people here were simply buying the drivers licences and officials were making a good R60 000 a day.” Investigations have been going on for six months. Safety and security department Joseph Mabuza says: “We have been getting complaints from people that there are officials who are selling driving licences, so these intelligence operations are going to assist us because others will learn from other testing centres.” The operations will be extended to other municipalities.
