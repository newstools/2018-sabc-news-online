Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi says he is pleased that the online application system is now being embraced after it was largely rejected two years ago. He says 74 000 Grade One and Eight learners have been placed in schools since the placement process started last Friday. However, about 120 000 parents who received SMSes with placement offers on Friday have yet to respond. The department has assured the 90 000 parents who haven’t received placement offers that their children will be placed by the end of October. He says: “Two years ago, there was a total rejection of the system, that this system is not working, this system is frustrating or this system is not assisting all parents.” He says one of the major sticking points is people forgetting their login details. He says: “The department is thrilled thus far. I think there is a complete acceptance that our online registration has made things easier and has made schools accessible to those that couldn’t access them. But the communication now is the communication of the outcome. We are just dealing with challenges that come out of that.”
