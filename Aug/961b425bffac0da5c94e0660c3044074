Democratic Alliance Leader, Mmusi Maimane has joined the call for August 16 to be declared either a public holiday or a Commemorative Day for the Marikana massacre. This is to remember the 34 Lonmin mineworkers who were shot and killed by police during a wild-cat strike at Lonmin, six years ago. Maimane was speaking at the koppie in Marikana where the shooting took place and where union Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union is holding its annual Marikana Commemorative Day, Maimane says he has written to President Cyril Ramaphosa regarding the matter. “To declare the something a commemorative day is well within the powers of the president without even adjusting the schedule of the public holiday. It would be ideal that South African all over, will never ever, forget a day like this one. And now I am asking Cyril Ramaphosa, if the ANC has changed he will honour this day. I will continue that call even in Parliament.” Watch for more:
