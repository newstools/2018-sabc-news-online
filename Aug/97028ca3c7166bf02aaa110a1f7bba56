Student activist Mcebo Dlamini had a warrant of arrest issued and then cancelled after he arrived late for his case in the Johannesburg Magistrate’s Court. His trial date was going to be scheduled on Monday. Dlamini is accused of causing malicious damage to property, public violence and other crimes following the #FeesMustFall protests. He was arrested in October 2016. The magistrate informed him that his case would be back in court on September the 3rd. He will have to explain why he was late on Monday and provide a sick note for missing a court date previously. Dlamini says he was late because he was still recovering from fatigue following his walk to the Union Buildings in Pretoria on Friday.  “I was 15 mins late for court because my feet could (not) carry me to court. Even when they called me, I told them I was walking by the parking, but they still handed the warrant of arrest, which I still feel was harsh and probably irrational because it wasn’t even before 12.” Dlamini’s long walk to the Union Building Last week Dlamini walked from Wits University to the Union Building. He said his long walk to Pretoria was aimed at alerting government authorities about the plight of students charged or convicted for crimes committed during the FeesMustFall campaign. “This is not a honeymoon or a romantic event that we would take a bus or Gautrain to come here. It is a revolution and a revolution is pain, and we are enduring the pain and the same pain that our comrades who are serving in jail. You can imagine the pain and the careers that are yet to end with the continuation of the prosecution.”
