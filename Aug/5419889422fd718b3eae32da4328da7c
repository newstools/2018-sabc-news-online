Minerals Council South Africa has launched a National Day of Safety and Health in Mining to improve the sector’s safety performance. This year, the industry has recorded several mining accidents resulting in a loss of about 58 lives. The campaign is the industry’s re-commitment to its goal of zero harm and ensuring that all employees are safe at all times. “This day is not only one day we have set aside. We have set aside the whole month for all of our 66 member companies throughout their operation to observe the moment where they re-dedicate themselves to improving health and safety of our employees,” says executive head of Anglo American South Africa, Andile Sangqu. “I must also say that it is important to recognise that in 2018 our record in terms of safety has improved a lot, from where it was 20 years ago. Having said that, there’s still more work that still needs to be done,” adds Sangqu.
