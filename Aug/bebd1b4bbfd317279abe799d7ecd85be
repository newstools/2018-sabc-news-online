Leaders of the Democratic Alliance (DA) in the Western Cape are to meet on Monday to discuss the processes towards the election of the new Cape Town mayor. Outgoing mayor Patricia de Lille resigned last week following protracted differences with her party. DA leader in the province, Bonginkosi Madikizela, says the criteria for applicants will be discussed at Monday’s meeting. “Once we open for application that’s only when we can receive applications. Normally the process is that once the vacancy is declared, we open up for applications and all those people who meet the requirements to appear before the selection panel, will then appear before for the panel. The council chairperson will then select the suitable candidate.” Watch related video below:
