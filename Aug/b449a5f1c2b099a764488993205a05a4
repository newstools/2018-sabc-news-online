Parliament’s Standing Committee on Public Accounts (Scopa) says it is worried about non-capping on purchases of ministerial houses. It has emerged that the Department of Public Works spent about R9 million for houses for certain ministers while others live in houses that cost about R4 million. The committee has also expressed concern that the department has spent half a million rand on braai entertainment areas for ministerial houses. Committee Chairperson Themba Godi says South Africans cannot be expected to cough up that kind of money for braai areas for ministers. Public Works Minister Thulas Nxesi has conceded that there’s a need for the review of the Ministerial handbook. “Clearly the issue of the limits in whatever goes to the ministers needs a radical review in terms of the ministerial handbook but unfortunately that review of the ministerial handbook cannot be done by the officials it has to be done by the executive.”
