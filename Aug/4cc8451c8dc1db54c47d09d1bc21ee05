The acting ombudsman for Consumer Goods and Services, Magauta Mphahlele has expressed concern over reports of fake and expired goods being sold at Spaza shops. Several videos are doing the rounds on social media, allegedly exposing fake produce sold by Spaza shops that are mainly run by foreign nationals. Recently, police in the Northern Cape closed a counterfeit factory worth over R70-million following a sting operation. Mphahlele has urged people to report the sale of counterfeit items to the National Consumer Commission. â€œThe National Consumer Commission is the enforcement body and in view of the seriousness of this matter. The commission would be the place to go, even with the Listeriosis outbreak, the commission has the power to order a recall which is a removal of those products if they are found to not be safe or defective in any way.
