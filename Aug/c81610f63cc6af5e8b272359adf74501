The widows of 10 men killed in the days preceding the Marikana tragedy on 16 August 2012, are calling for President Cyril Ramaphosa to intervene in what they say is animosity between them and widows of the 34 miners killed by police. The call was made during a commemoration ceremony held by Platinum mining company Lonmin, to remember the 44 people who died during a violent strike in August 2012. The commemoration is a prelude to the main event that the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (AMCU) has organised for Thursday. Spokesperson for the ten widows, Ayisha Fundi has called for Ramaphosa’s urgent intervention in the matter. “He says, Thuma Mina Campaign so we are calling him as the ten widows of Marikana who our loved ones were killed by the strikers. He must come and resolve this issue in Marikana now and not tomorrow. We wrote him letters several times and there is not even a single letter that he replied,” says Fundi. Speaking at Wednesday’s commemoration event, Executive Vice President for Human Resources at Lonmin, Khaya Ngcwembe, reported on the progress made in addressing housing challenges since 2012. “All of us are proud to report that by the end of 2018, Lonmin would have invested R500 million in housing since 2013. All single sex legacy hostels have been converted yielding 759 family units and 2162 single units for our employees and their families. By the end of 2018, we will have 1240 apartments that will be allocated to our employees,” says Ngcwembe. Ngcwembe says his company has managed to address the demands striking workers fought for in 2012. “Another issue that has received our attention and priority is the livelihood of our employees and I am very pleased once again to report that rock drillers can now earn cash package of R15 770 rand and R17 950 if you include medical aid to that number.” Watch related videos below:
