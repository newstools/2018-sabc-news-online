President Cyril Ramaphosa will on Tuesday host British Prime Minister Theresa May who will be on a working visit to South Africa. May’s working visit seeks to further cement economic relations built up over several decades. The visit follows bilateral meetings between the two leaders during the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in London in April and the G-7 in Canada in June this year. During these bilateral engagements, the two leaders discussed potential partnerships between the United Kingdom and South Africa and efforts to strengthen bilateral trade and investment relations. According to The Presidency, the United Kingdom was South Africa’s 6th largest global trading partner in 2017, with total trade at R79.5 billion. The UK also remains the key source of longhaul tourism to South Africa with nearly 448 000 visitors in 2017. The last official visit to South Africa by a sitting UK Prime Minister was in 2011.
