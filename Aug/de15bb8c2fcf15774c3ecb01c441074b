Four community patrollers have been killed and two police officers critically injured after a police vehicle they were traveling in collided with another vehicle in Vanderbijlpark on the Vaal in Gauteng. The police vehicle was from the Barrage police station. The community patrollers were part of the Orange Farm Community Policing Forum. Several of them were also injured. Police spokesperson, Mathapelo Peters says the incident is a blow to the law enforcement community. She says: “It is reported that the police vehicle from the barrage was ferrying 10 community patrollers when it collided with another vehicle. One police officer has since been discharged from the hospital. The second is still in hospital in a stable condition. Six of the patrollers are still on hospital.” “The loss of these patrollers will affect the law enforcement community they chose to serve along with the police,” says Peters.
