The man accused of being the mastermind behind the murder of 20-year-old Kurtlee Pillay has been acquitted on all charges. Blaine Raman was found not guilty by the Durban High Court. Pillay was stabbed several times and then dragged under his car in November 2014. Raman was accused of the kidnapping and murder of Pillay along with two others, Dinesh Nana and Bilal Tayob. Raman also faced a robbery charge with aggravating circumstances. Charges against Nana and Tayob were withdrawn because there was insufficient evidence linking them to the case. Judge Liz Law told the court that the case against Raman was riddled with discrepancies. NPA’s Nathasha Ramkisson Kara says:”I can confirm that the matter was in the Durban high court today and the accused was equated off all charges.”
