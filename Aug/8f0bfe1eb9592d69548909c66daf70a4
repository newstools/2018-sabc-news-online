Johannesburg’s waste management company, PikitUp has warned residents of possible disruptions in their waste collection services this week. Former Jozi@Work employees are allegedly threatening to prevent workers from accessing the various depots in the city. Earlier this year, over 300 former Jozi@Work employees staged a sit-in outside the Metro Centre building in Braamfontein, demanding that Johannesburg Mayor Herman Mashaba employ them permanently as he had allegedly promised. PikitUp spokesperson Muzi Mkhwanazi says they cannot accommodate all the workers. ‘There have been discussions with the former Jozi@Work employees leading to the insourcing process which was done last week. Now the criteria was one of the ways which was used to insource the workers and some of the workers did not meet that particular criteria and currently there are thousands and thousands of former employees, PikitUP cannot absorb all of the workers.”
