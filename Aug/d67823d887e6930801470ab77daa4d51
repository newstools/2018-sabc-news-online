Sol Plaatje Municipality Mayor, Mangaliso Matika, will resume his mayoral duties with immediate effect. This after the Kimberley High Court ruled in his favour, declaring a council meeting that was held last month to remove him, as illegal. The matter was brought before court by the Democratic Alliance (DA), following the motion of no confidence vote that was passed, after which Matika refused to vacate the office. The DA’s application has been dismissed with costs. The DA’s Andrew Louw says even though they are disappointed with the outcome, they accept the court’s decision. “What happened here today is completely in the hands of the courts; as the DA, I have said it on numerous occasions and I’m going to say it again, that we believe in the rule of the law, and we will abide by the outcomes of the hearings of today… subsequent to that, we are not happy, because as it is Matika does not enjoy the confidence of the community, Matika does not enjoy the confidence of the council, as well as the people out there.”
