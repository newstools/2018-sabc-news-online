President Cyril Ramaphosa has joined others in expressing his condolences to the Sobukwe family, following the passing of Zondeni Veronica Sobukwe. Mama Zondeni, also known as “The Mother of Azania,” was born on the 27th of July 1927 in Hlobane village in Kwazulu-Natal. She was married to the founding father of the Pan Africanist Congress of Azania (PAC) Robert Sobukwe from 1950 until his death in 1978. She died during the early hours of Wednesday morning at the age of 91. Zondeni was a health practitioner and an activist in her own right. She repeatedly wrote to the apartheid government during the nine years her husband was imprisoned on Robben Island from 1960, requesting his release or to be allowed a meeting with him. President Ramaphosa has described Zondeni’s loss during Women’s Month as a sad one. The president further says the nation has lost a heroine of resistance and a fighter for the freedom of all South Africans, who continued her activism into our democratic dispensation.
