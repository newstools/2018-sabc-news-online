An explosion at the Eikenhof substation in Johannesburg South has resulted in power outages in many surrounding suburbs. City Power spokesperson Isaac Mangena says the fire has also affected the Eikenhof Rand Water pumping station, which may result in the taps running dry on Gauteng’s West Rand as well as parts of Rustenburg in the North West province. Mangena says it is not yet possible to predict when the power supply will be restored. He says they still do not know what caused the fire.  Mangena says: “Emergency personel are currently inside trying to put out the fire. When they declare the place safe, our technicians will be able to go inside and ascertain what caused the fire and if the electricity can be restored any time soon.”
