National Head of the Directorate of Priority Crimes Investigations (Hawks) General Godfrey Lebeya says he’s noted with serious concern the alleged roles played by members of the unit as presented at the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture on Friday. This follows explosive revelations made by former deputy finance minister Mcebisi Jonas at the inquiry. Jonas testified that the Hawks had attempted to sabotage the investigation into the Guptas’ with approaches to bribe him by trying to force him to sign a false statement. Jonas repeated under oath his earlier allegations that the Guptas had offered him the position of finance minister and bribes of R600 000 on the spot and up to R600 million later. Lebeya says the Hawks will enlist their assistance in visiting the matter once witnesses have completed their testimonies. Watch the video below for related news:
