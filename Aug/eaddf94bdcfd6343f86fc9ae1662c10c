Eskom was set to sign a wage agreement with striking unions on Thursday ending a strike that has lasted over two months, however a precondition set by labour unions has set back the signing of the agreement. The power utility has been engaged in wage negotiations with labour unions NUMSA, the NUM and Solidarity. On Wednesday, the unions accepted the latest offer which includes a R10 000 once off payment to workers who fall under the bargaining unit plus a 7.5% salary increase this year and another 7% for 2019 and 2020. The unions however will only sign on the basis that those workers who were striking do not face disciplinary action. Eskom did not agree to this stipulation prompting the unions to request a meeting with Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan and the Eskom board. The CCMA has called on Eskom to allow the meeting to take place early next week. Related Video:
