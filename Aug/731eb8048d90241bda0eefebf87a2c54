The Social Security Agency (Sassa) says it will respond on Friday to the Constitutional Court ruling, after it has studied the judgement. This relates to the controversial contractual matter with Cash Paymaster Services. The court on Friday ordered the agency and it’s Chief Executive Officer, Pearl Bhengu in her official capacity to pay the legal costs. The court also found that former Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini failed in her supervisory role to Sassa, and also erred in deferring her responsibilities to an inter-ministerial committee. She, however, will not be held personally liable for the legal costs. Sassa spokesperson Kgomoco Diseko says they’re currently studying the judgement and issue a comprehensive statement on Friday.
