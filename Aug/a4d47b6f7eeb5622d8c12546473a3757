Police have fired rubber bullets to try and disperse an angry crowd protesting in KaNyamazane near Mbombela in Mpumalanga.  Residents have been protesting since Monday, demanding government speed up the process of repairing houses that were damaged by a hailstorm four months ago. Mpumalanga Premier Refilwe Mtsweni was chased away by the residents on Wednesday when she tried to address them. The violent protest has now spread to other villages such as Pienaar, Kamsogwana, Newskom and Clau Clau.  Taxi operators have also raised concerns that the protest action is affecting their business.
