Curbing initiation deaths during circumcision season in the Eastern Cape is at the centre of a two-day meeting of the Provincial Initiation Technical Task Team held in East London. This after 21 initiates died during 2018’s winter initiation season. The deceased were from the Amathole, OR Tambo, Buffalo City Metro, Chris Hani and Alfred Nzo District Municipalities. Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs Spokesperson, Mamnkeli Ngam says they hope the meeting will come up with solutions to curb the deaths. “This meeting seeks to ensure that all of us, we share ideas and grant plans going forward so that when we enter the summer initiation season there are no deaths. The report will be taken forward to the provincial coordinating committee which is composed of the MEC and the Chairperson of the house for them to make recommendations and take the process forward. Because we want to ensure that every stakeholder in the province is able to make a contribution to have a free and safe initiation season from this year going forward”. Watch below for more:
