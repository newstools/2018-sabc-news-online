Members of the Native Tribal Indigenous Movement, which comprises several traditional leaders from various provinces, have threatened to contest the 2019 general elections if government fails to engage properly on the issue of land expropriation without compensation. The movement’s president, General Petrus Ndaba says the ANC stands to lose the entire country to the opposition if it does not handle the land issue with the sensitivity it deserves. He addressed traditional leaders affiliated to the movement at Soshanguve, north of Pretoria. “So, we call our government. They must come and talk to us once and because there was a law that was passed about the land. If they do not come we will contest the election.” “And we don’t want that. That is why we want to meet President Cyril Ramaphosa with due respect. Even the former President Jacob Zuma ran away from us, and we are not rebels in South Africa.” Click video below:
