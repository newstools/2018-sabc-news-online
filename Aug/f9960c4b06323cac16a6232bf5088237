Zimbabwe’s opposition MDC alliance and its leader, Nelson Chamisa, has rejected the Constitutional Court’s ruling on the country’s recent elections. On Friday, the Court dismissed a challenge by the MDC and Chamisa to the results of the July poll as released by the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission. Zimbabwe’s Chief Justice Luke Malaba declared President Emmerson Mnangagwa the winner of the presidential elections, saying there wasn’t enough evidence presented to support the MDC’s case. Chamisa, however, insists that he gained 2,6million votes and Mnangagwa less than 2 million. He says the party will meet to determine the way forward. “I want to thank those who voted for me, over 2.6 million, thank you for investing your trust in us. This is not the end of the road. Change is coming. Yes, the ConCourt route has been shut, but the legal door is not the only door to happiness or freedom. We have the right to peaceful protests. In the party, we have said we will meet next week to have a comprehensive analysis of the judgement and to have a comprehensive view of where we are going politically,” says Chamisa.
