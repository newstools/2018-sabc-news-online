The National Freedom Party Women’s Movement is holding its provincial Women’s Day celebration in Hlazane area of under Umhlabuyalingana Municipality on the far north of KwaZulu-Natal. The celebration is held under the theme, Advocate for Women’s Rights Every-day. The party earlier this month abandoned all courts cases to pave a way for its leaders to reconcile.  KwaZulu-Natal NFP Secretary Zandile Myeni says women are faced with various challenges daily. “We are here under the theme that says advocate for women’s rights every day and everywhere the challenge is that when you look at the government currently they look at women issues only in August whereas NFP Women’s Movement we feel that women issues must be dealt with every day everywhere meaning that it must not only be political parties and also be government even in churches in communities because when you look at women issues they require us, all of us to advocate so that we will have a generation where all these challenges that we have now will be eradicated.”
