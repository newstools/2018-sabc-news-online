President Cyril Ramaphosa says it’s inconceivable that people should be deprived of quality healthcare because of their financial status. He says government is determined to provide universal healthcare to all South Africans regardless of their social status. Ramaphosa has been speaking at the National Health Insurance and Medical Schemes Amendment Bill Stakeholder Consultative Meeting in Pretoria. He says once the NHI bill is passed,  they will start implementing the new health system and ensure that everybody is covered by 2025. “It is inconceivable that anyone today could argue against the need for every South African to have access to healthcare services on the basis of need and not on their ability to pay. It is therefore a duty of a democratic and progressive government to create policies that ensure that every South African can have access to quality healthcare and not just rich people”.
