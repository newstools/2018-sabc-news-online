Mpumalanga women have been encouraged to get involved in agricultural projects. MEC for Agriculture, Rural Development, Land and the Environment, Vusi Shongwe was speaking during the province’s Female Entrepreneur Awards. He says there are a number of projects including Phezukomkhono and Masibuyele Esibayeni that women can participate in. Shongwe also called on disable women to come forward to be assisted by the department. He says: “To make sure that they participate in all aspect of agriculture, you talk of tilling the land, you talk of breeding cattle.” Meanwhile a farmer, Esther Mhlongo has urged young people to enter into the farming sector. Mhlongo runs a farm near Barberton where she grows macadamia nuts and also does livestock farming. She has committed to mentor young people. “I wish that young people can focus on farming and must go to the agricultural college so that they can learn farming. I wish to teach them because I can mentor them to grow macadamia to the full scale. I am happy to help the youth and women so that they can become macadamia growers.”
