Cape Town Mayoral Committee Member for Safety and Security, JP Smith will approach Western Cape Premier Helen Zille in a bid to get her to take legal action against the South African government. This as an attempt to compel the national government to deploy more police to the city. Smith says they will also be approaching Provincial Minister of Safety and Security, Dan Plato to take legal steps against the national police department in order to force it to give the province adequate crime intelligence resources. Smith was speaking at a public meeting in Green Point, close to the Cape Town CBD. “We have to ensure that National Government does their constitutional job, that they fulfill their constitutional duty… and in this case I think this means dragging them to court. We should take them to court get a High Court Mandamus to compel them to comply to their own norms and standards. Not the norms and standards we say they should have, but the norms and standards they have for themselves adopted as acceptable levels of policing resources.’
