The ANC in Mpumalanga says there is no crisis within the party in resolving the on going violent protest action in KaNyamazane outside Mbombela. Senior members of the ANC, calling themselves a crisis committee, say that since 2008 the province has been experiencing political challenges. The committee reacted on the ongoing protest that erupted earlier this week at KaNyamazane calling all stakeholders to calm the situation. Acting Provincial ANC Chairperson, Mandla Ndlovu, says the problems cannot be described as a crisis. Ndlovu says people must stop creating crises where there is none. “What we know is that as an organisation we always have problems and what is good is we must be able to deal with all our problems. “I acknowledge that currently we got some problems in other areas and we are capable in dealing with all the problems that are affecting the ANC including the one in KaNyamazane,” he adds.
