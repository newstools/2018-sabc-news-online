The Supreme Court of Appeal in Bloemfontein is expected to hand down judgment on Tuesday in the appeal by former Northern Cape ANC Chairperson John  Block and his business associate Christo Scholtz. The two have appealed against a 15 year sentence imposed by the High Court in Kimberly for money laundering and corruption. Block and his co-accused, the CEO of Trifecta Investments, Scholtz were granted bail of R 150 000 each. The duo were involved in leasing office space to the Northern Cape Social Development Department at inflated prices. Scholtz was a director in Trifecta Holdings, which secured the tenders for the leases. Block also received a confiscation order of R 2 million for his assets while Scholtz received one for R 53 million. Watch related video below:
