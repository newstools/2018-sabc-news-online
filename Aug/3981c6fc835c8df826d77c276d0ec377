The sky is the limit for a Mpumalanga girl, Baby Mthethwa, this as she is jetting off to George, in the Western Cape – in the hope of becoming a pilot. It’s a childhood dream that’s close to becoming a reality for Mthethwa. “I have been in a plane but not a moving one. I wanted to be a pilot ever since I was 10-year-old. Having this opportunity is very exciting and a bit scary because I am going to a have to adapt to a new environment,” says Mthethwa. Her family is beaming with pride. “I want her to go there and finish her studies and come back home and improve our lives. You can see our life is not that good. We have been working for her all her life to have a better life,” says Mthethwa’s grandmother Nelly Mawuse. The 18-year-old is pushing boundaries and breaking through barriers. “At school like me we have teachers that discourage us to become pilots because they measure our background and tell us it’s expensive. You’d rather go to university because you can get a bursary that can sponsor you. But for pilot is just for white people and expensive.” WATCH BELOW:
