The DA in the North West says the Provincial Executive Council’s decision to place eight distressed municipalities under administration does not make sense. Premier Job Mokgoro announced the decision last week. He said their failure to obtain clean audit outcomes necessitated the decision. However, DA provincial leader Joe Macgluwa believes some municipalities that are performing poorly have been excluded. He says: “Is this now a factional approach when it comes to municipalities that are under administration. We believe the premier must take us into his trust and its long overdue to have this province at a working condition so that we can deliver and we cannot tolerate a situation whereby not a single municipality is getting a clear outcome.” “It is unacceptable, so this move or stunt by the premier should be seen as a move to get into certain municipalities.”
