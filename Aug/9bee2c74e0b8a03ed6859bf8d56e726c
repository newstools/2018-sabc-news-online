The death of Professor Bongani Mayosi has left a huge void in the medical fraternity and health sector. This is the view of Sefako Makgatho Health Sciences University’s Vice-Chancellor, Professor Chris de Beer. De Beer was speaking at the late Mayosi’s memorial service at the university in Ga-Rankuwa, North West of Pretoria. He said Mayosi influenced many current medical practitioners to join the profession. Those attending include Higher Education and Training Minister Naledi Pandor, Gauteng Health MEC, Gwen Ramokgopa and Cosatu President Sdumo Dlamini. Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs Minister Zweli Mkhize says the country, the continent and the world at large have lost the best public servant in Professor Bongani Mayosi. Mkhize says government is saddened by the untimely death of the professor. Mkhize says Mayosi was one of few students to enter medical school at the young age of 16. Speakers from various universities and research institutions described Mayosi as a visionary with unique leadership skills. Another memorial service is taking place at the University of Cape Town. Mayosi will be laid to rest on Saturday. Click below for more on the story:
