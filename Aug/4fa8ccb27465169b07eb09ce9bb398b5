Gauteng police have condemned the acts of mob justice that took place in Daveyton, east of Johannesburg, on Tuesday, which resulted in the death of one person. Since then, five men between the ages of 18 and 21 have been attacked in Daveyton after being accused by the community of committing a string of robberies in the area. Police spokesperson Mavela Masondo warns the community that it is a criminal act to take the law into their own hands. “We just want to warn the community that if you take the law into your own hands it’s a criminal act and it’s a very serious one and you will be arrested. We are searching for the people who did this. If you have a complaint about service delivery or anything that they think authorities are not doing, let them come forward and not take the law into their own hands because that’s a criminal act”.
