Two babies have died at the Thelle Mogoerane Hospital in Vosloorus on the East Rand following a Klebsiella pneumonia outbreak at the facility. Seven babies contracted Klebsiella at the hospital’s neonatal unit last month. The five babies were transferred to the Charlotte Maxeke Academic Hospital and have recovered. Klebsiella is a bacterial infection that affects all the organs in the body. It may present as pneumonia, meningitis or bone infection. It is resistant to most antibiotics. Doctor Medupe Modisane who is the Acting Chief of hospital services in Gauteng says the outbreak is now under control. “Yes, there was an outbreak and two babies died subsequently. The outbreak is fairly under control. We shouldn’t be worried at the moment but we will continue to be vigilant to make sure that it doesn’t re-occur,” says Mogoerane.
