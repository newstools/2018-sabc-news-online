Police in Bloemfontein have made a quick arrest following a cash heist that happened at a local filling station in the CBD. An undisclosed amount of cash as well as three illegal firearms were found in the suspect’s car. Provincial commissioner, Moeketsi Sempe, says the arrest was a result of good intelligence. “In the vehicle we found the three firearms that are illegal. Its one R5, one LM5 as well as a pistol; we arrested one male person for possession of illegal firearms. Then in his possession there were a number of items that we will use for investigation purposes. We believe that we might link him with other serious crimes that might have occurred in this particular province where he might be involved with other people.” Earlier in the day, a group of armed men robbed a cash vehicle outside a farm near Velddrif on the West Coast. They escaped with an undisclosed amount of cash. It is unclear if anyone was injured during the heist. Police say they’re probing the incident.
