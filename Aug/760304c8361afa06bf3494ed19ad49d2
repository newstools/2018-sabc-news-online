Acting CEO of Government Communication Information Service (GCIS), Phumla William, says while testifying at the State Capture inquiry on Friday morning, she received a text message from former head Mzwanele Manyi, telling her to say there were no breakfasts organised by the Gupta- backed New Age newspaper during his tenure at the GCIS. Williams also says she had a strained relationship with former Communications Minister Faith Muthambi. She has been answering questions about the period between January and February 2011, when Manyi replaced former GCIS head Themba Maseko. On Thursday Maseko told the inquiry that he was replaced after being requested by former President Jacob Zuma to help the Gupta family with their media project. Williams, has told the commission of inquiry into State Capture that the change from Themba Maseko to Mzwanele Manyi as the head of GCIS had a big impact on the morale of staff.
