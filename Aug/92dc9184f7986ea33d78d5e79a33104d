President Cyril Ramaphosa has announced that a National Gender Summit will be held on the 31st of August to deal with issues of gender-based violence. Scores of women participated in the #TotalShutDown march to the Union Buildings in Pretoria at the beginning of the month have submitted a memorandum to Ramaphosa’s office, suggesting that a summit be held for civil society and government. This is to put a stop to gender-based violence. Ramaphosa gave the keynote address at National Women’s Day celebrations in Paarl in the Western Cape. “I am here to say, on Women’s Day, that the government has agreed that this National Gender Summit should take place on 31 August to forge consensus on appropriate approaches that should be taken on an urgent basis to deal with the crisis of gender-based violence; discrimination against women, and gender disparities. The recommendations of the summit must be comprehensive, guide the work of government and the activities of all stakeholders,” says Ramaphosa.
