The Central Committee of the South African Communist Party (SACP) is holding a three-day meeting in Johannesburg over this weekend. Top on the agenda is the country’s economic crisis, which saw the increase of VAT earlier in 2018. The SACP’s First Deputy Secretary General, Solly Mapaila says it is time that the government considers the needs of the poor and avoids the widening gap between the rich and the poor. He says this meeting will also focus on other issues affecting the ordinary citizens of the country. “(The meeting) will of course discuss other sectors including the issue of VAT and how this impacts on the living standards of the poor and quality of life of the poor and also, we will look at the issues of municipalities. Minister Zweli Mkhize will be here to tell us about some of the issues and some overarching perspective.” Mapaila has weighed in on the violent protest unfolding in Mbombela, Mpumalanga. He says ignorant government officials are to be blamed for what is happening. Mapaila has, however, denounced any vandalism of property. “It’s unacceptable for political leaders to hold office and when there are issues raised in a community they are not engaging with the community effectively. But we are also calling on our communities not to destroy property in the process of many protests. But we are on the side with them, that their issues should have long been attended to. ” Click below for more on the story:
