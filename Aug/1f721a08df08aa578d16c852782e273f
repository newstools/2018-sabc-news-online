President Cyril Ramaphosa has launched government’s plans to improve the provision of sanitation infrastructure in mostly rural areas at a ceremony in Pretoria. This follows the public outcry over failure by the Department of Basic Education to eradicate pit latrines in the country’s poorest schools. The President is joined by senior officials from the United Nations Children’s Fund, the Nelson Mandela Foundation and other civil society organisations to pledge support to the initiative which seeks to improve the dignity of learners. Ramaphosa has called for all to lend a hand. “Just as it takes a village to raise a child, so too does it take an entire society to educate a child. With today’s launch we are calling on all South Africans, all corporates in our country, NGO’s and international partners to be part of this ambitious but also necessary effort to give effect to the fundamental human rights of our learners.” “We will also be contributing into the broader goal of decent sanitation for all our people,” adds the President.
