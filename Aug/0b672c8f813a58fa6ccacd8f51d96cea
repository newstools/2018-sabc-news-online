Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan says those involved in corruption in the public sector are often oblivious about its impact. He was a guest at a book launch about state capture at Cavendish Square, in Cape Town Tuesday night. Professor Ivor Chipkin is co-author of the book titled “Shadow State: The Politics of State Capture”. It reflects on the work of two academics who’ve studied the structure of government since 2009. Gordhan says multi-billion-rand state companies in the country are on their knees because of state capture. He says over the last few years the country has had a terrible experience where public resources that could be used to provide housing, transport and welfare to millions of South Africans has instead been finding its way into secret bank accounts overseas or in South Africa. He says: “What we need to do is to put all of our efforts together to build this economy, create more jobs, create more opportunities, develop our young people so that they can compete both in South Africa and across the world.”
