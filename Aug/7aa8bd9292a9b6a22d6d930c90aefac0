Paramedics from KwaZulu-Natal emergency service together with colleagues from several private emergency services have treated at least 33 other patients at the scene. Many patients were removed from the scene privately before paramedics arrived at the scene. The bus had been transporting 60 people. The exact cause of this specific crash is not known at this stage and is being investigated.” KwaZulu-Natal authorities are still investigating the bus crash in the north of the province.
