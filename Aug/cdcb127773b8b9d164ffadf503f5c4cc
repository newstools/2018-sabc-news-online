Leaders of the KaNyamazane protest in Mpumalanga say Premier Refilwe Mtsweni will not engage with residents of the area on Monday morning. This after a meeting held at the African National Congress’s Provincial office on Sunday night, between the community leaders, the premier and the acting ANC chairperson Mandla Ndlovu. Angry KaNyamazane residents chased Mtsweni away last week and embarked on protest action which disrupted schooling in the area. The residents’ spokesperson Edwin Mavuso says their protest action will continue as planned. Mavuso says, “She will not come, the message that was circulated that make Refilwe Mtsweni is coming today in the morning is not true. She is not, she will wait for the community of KaNyamazane to say whether they going to welcome her or not.” “We are going to have a meeting with the people of KaNyamazane to determine whether they are willing to meet with Refilwe Mtsweni or they are still going to maintain that they want to see Comrade Cyril Ramaphosa. That’s the position where we are standing,” adds Mavuso.
