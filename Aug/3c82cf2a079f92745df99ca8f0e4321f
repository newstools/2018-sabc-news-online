African National Congress (ANC) president, Cyril Ramaphosa is on Sunday expected to lead the National Executive Committee(NEC) members to consult with branches in Rustenburg at Bojonala region in the North West. Bojanala, comprising of Rustenburg and Brits, is the party’s biggest region. It’s one of the three out of four regions that have failed to hold successful conferences due to continued factions and allegations of parallel structures. Bojanala region is currently led by a Regional Task Team after it’s conference was nullified by the court. It is here where members of the party assaulted each other over the legitimacy of branch leaders. Allegations are that the Provincial Executive Committee chaired by Chairperson Supra Mahumapelo has been confirming leaders against the wishes of other members. This, according to some faction led to parallel structures being established. Although the PEC denied this, on the eve of the party’s National Elective Conference in December last year, over 30 branches took the PEC to court and won the case. This led to some delegates from the region being barred from voting at the National Conference as they were not legitimate.
