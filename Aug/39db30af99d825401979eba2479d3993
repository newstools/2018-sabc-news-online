Limpopo Premier Stan Mathabatha has warned police officers not to turn away women who report cases of abuse. He was speaking at Tibane Stadium outside Polokwane during the provincial Women’s Day celebration. Mathabatha says police must act swiftly when cases of women and child abuse are reported. He says it is the responsibility of the courts to adjudicate on the cases. “We must call on law enforcement officers to improve their response time to incidents of domestic violence, including the abuse of children. Desist from the tendency to turn back victims of alleged abuses because they think that there is no sufficient evidence in the case or sometimes they simply say there is no case here.” Mathabatha has also encouraged women to report the incidents of abuse to their church pastors and traditional leaders. “If you are unable to go to the police station, tell you church pastor, or at the tribal leader, you can inform them to be anonymous when reporting the case if you are afraid that he might victimise him by reporting him,” says Mathabatha.
