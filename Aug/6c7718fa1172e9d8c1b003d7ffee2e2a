The government has called on pressure groups to stop peddling lies about South Africa. This follows United States President Donald Trump’s tweet on land reform which Pretoria called an irresponsible spreading of false information by the US Administration. The Minister of International Relations and Cooperation addressed the media on a wide range of issues in Pretoria today. In his tweet, Trump had instructed US Secretary of State to closely study the South Africa land and farm seizures and the large scale killings of farmers. “The government will not allow pressure groups telling lies about South Africa, the process we have undertaken has taken on board all processes that need to be followed.” Meanwhile, Pretoria will host Prime Minister Theresa May of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland on a working visit. The Prime Minister will be accompanied by a business delegation. The visit comes after President Cyril Ramaphosa visited the UK to attend the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting.
