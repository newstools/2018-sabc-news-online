Basotho and cultural enthusiasts descended on the Basotho Cultural Village near QwaQwa on Saturday. They were ushering in the New Year in the Basotho calendar. This is a celebration which commemorates the beginning of the year with different rituals. It was a day packed with songs and dance as well as traditional cuisine and dazzling attire. Free State Arts and Culture MEC Mathabo Leeto says, “We must come up with ways to use our food and clothes to establish businesses to enhance the economy of the country. This will also fight poverty.” This was also an opportunity for some people to exhibit their craft. The event is also being used to strength ties between South Africa and Lesotho. Lesotho Telecommunications Minister Thesele Maseribane says, “Today we are launching a blanket as a token of appreciation for the role OR Tambo has played in Lesotho.” Maluti-A-Phofung Executive Mayor, Gibert Mokotso says, “As the municipality we will continue supporting during their New Year celebration so that we teach the young generation about our tradition.” One of the participants says it is important to celebrate this day, to preserve the culture, “The day serves to teach children where they are coming and where they are going.” The event is expected to become a staple in years to come.
