The African National Congress is calling on all Cape Town residents to refuse to pay the 10% increase in water tariffs. Some of the party’s heavyweights are in the Western Cape for the entire week to interact with various communities on a number of service delivery issues. ANC deputy secretary-general Jesse Duarte has taken the party’s message to Mitchel’s Plain on the Cape Flats. She says the increase in water tariffs will have a negative impact on the poorest of the poor. “I think if we all stand together and make our voices very loud. You know our voices can’t be mute. Our voice must be very loud and say to the city of Cape Town no we are all of us not going to be paying this increase. We are all of us not going to allow you to come and take away our homes and want to take us to court to recoup the money. We are not not being criminals. We are people who need water like everyone else and that’s really what we saying to the city of Cape Town.”
