South Africans must be prepared for the pain that will follow the implementation of Land Expropriation without Compensation. This is according to Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema. He was addressing the media in Johannesburg on Thursday and warned government not to use the land debate for political gains. Malema says millions of South Africans were robbed of their land during the apartheid era. He says his party will not allow a continuation of abuse against people because of fear of foreign sanctions. “If South Africans are not ready to expropriate land because of sanctions and back lash, then don’t vote for EFF because you vote for us, we are going to expropriate land.” Malema also stated that EFF will put a motion of no confidence against Tshwane Mayor Solly Msimanga. This follows the alleged prosecution of City Manager, Moeketsi Mosola. Malema says Mosola was targeted because he refused to accept corruption in the metro. “He must learn that in an arrangement like that you are forever consulting, it is a permanent thing. So this arrogance of his is a problem. Solly is a nice guy but he is unable to deal with the caucus of the DA, unlike Mashaba here, he confronts them directly, he’s not scared.” He has called for the pardon of all the “Fees Must Fall” activists by President Cyril Ramaphosa. The EFF leader says they are not yet sure about the legitimacy of the commission of inquiry into state capture currently underway but says they have reached out to the commission assuring that they have evidence  that could see all those implicated brought to book.
