Outgoing Cape Town Mayor Patricia de Lille says key interventions are underway for the City to release more land for affordable housing. De Lille addressed a full council meeting. She says apartheid spatial planning that keeps the majority of residents away from opportunities must be addressed decisively and speedily. She says the city must also be a catalyst for better integration of communities by speeding up the release of 11 identified pieces of land in Woodstock and Salt River and the city centre, while developing the foreshore freeway project. She says: “More pieces of government owned land must be made available for the development of affordable housing.”
