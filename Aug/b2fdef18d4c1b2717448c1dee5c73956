Evidence leader Mahlape Sello has told the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture that they have been unable to access cellphone records of former ANC MP Vytjie Mentor and former President Jacob Zuma’s chief of staff Lakela Kaunda, as telecommunications companies only keep records for five years. Mentor has said in her testimony that Kaunda called her on her official phone back in 2010, to set up a meeting with former President Jacob Zuma. Kaunda has denied the claim. Sello says the relevant cellphone records aren’t available. Mentor was giving evidence on the State Capture Inquiry. Click video below:
