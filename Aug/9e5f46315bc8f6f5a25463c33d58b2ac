Former Social Development minister Bathabile Dlamini will not have to foot the legal bill in relation to the prolonged contractual issue involving Cash Paymaster Services. South Africa Social Security Agency (Sassa) and its Chief Executive Officer, in her official capacity have been ordered to pay the costs. Delivering judgment in the Constitutional Court, Justice Leona Theron says the court has found that Dlaminiâ€™s role in the Sassa debacle does not constitute gross negligence and she did not act in bad faith.
