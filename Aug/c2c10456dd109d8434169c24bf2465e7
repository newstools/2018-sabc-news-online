The African National Congress (ANC) has welcomed the withdrawal of the Expropriation Bill by the Portfolio Committee on Public Works. The Committee withdrew the Bill due to a Parliamentary process reviewing Section 25 of the Constitution. The draft law on land reform currently provides for ‘just and equitable’ compensation of land. The committee says they cannot have a parallel process on the issue of land reform. ANC Whip of the Study Group on Public Works Freddie Adams says: “We need to change the constitution; that is the reason why we have withdrawn the bill from the committee and wait for the constitutional review committee’s tabling and report. I don’t think it is quite a delay. I think we just need to do things correctly because we could have proceeded with the bill, but if the Constitutional Court or anyone takes it to court, it would have caused much more delays. We need to take what the people have said into account and we can proceed with the bill after that. The bill will go back to the Speaker and then it will be sent back to the executive. It will then be resubmitted.” Watch the video below for related news:
