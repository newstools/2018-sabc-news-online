North West premier, Job Mokgoro,  says law enforcement agencies including the Hawks are investigating death threats that some administrators in the province have been receiving. The matter is so serious that some have stopped reporting for duty, fearing for their safety. Efforts to clean up the embattled North West province have been met with stumbling blocks and obstacles. “Law enforcement agencies have been thoroughly briefed about the threats and attention is being given to that. Clearly the administrators in the affected departments are touching the wrong nerve, hence the threats coming out,” says Mokgoro. A political analyst says that those implicated in corruption in the province are not prepared to go down without a fight. “It tells you how deep the rot goes because if those who are meant to come and assist, are not allowed to do that; at worst, are being threatened with physical violence, it tells you that a lot of spate spare work needs to be done prior to them being allowed to set foot on the ground,” says political analyst, Lesiba Tefo. Mokgoro did not want to disclose which departments were affected but  is adamant that the threats will not deter them from doing their work. “No threats are going to stop this. That intervention must happen, and that intervention must do its work in the most robust manner. South Africa as a nation- with 3.84 million in the province – people cannot be threatened by whirlwind people. That cannot be tolerated. That must be emphasized,” added Mokgoro. As efforts to clean up the North West continue, eight municipalities in the province will be placed under provincial administration as from next month. WATCH RELATED VIDEOS:
