Deputy President David Mabuza has defended himself in the National Assembly following an article in the New York Times alleging gross corruption by him while he was Premier of Mpumalanga. Mabuza was answering oral questions. Responding to a question by Democratic Alliance (DA) Member of Parliament (MP) John Steenhuisen on how Mabuza can be a custodian of Nelson Mandela’s legacy when he left a path of corruption, he said he has contributed significantly to the development of schools in the province. “I can’t be told by people from New York what is happening in South Africa where I live. Let me tell you what is happening in Mpumalanga… I found farm schools, something that does not deserve to be called a school, children walking distances, multiple schools, and one teacher. To date, I have closed 500 schools and build state of art boarding schools.” Mabuza says in an effort to cushion the effects of increasing food and fuel prices on the poor, they are looking at re configuring government. He is answering oral questions in the National Assembly. Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) Member of Parliament Mkhuleko Hlengwa asked Mabuza if there are immediate interventions that could be made, for instance suspending fuel levies. Mabuza says interventions such as reconfiguring government are under way. “We need to scale down public service, as we look at the Compensation bill. It can’t be sustained going forward… it is important to look at stringent matters of belt tightening…because conditions warrant it.”  Click below for more on the story:
