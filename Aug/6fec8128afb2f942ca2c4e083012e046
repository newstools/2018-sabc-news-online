The Treatment Action Campaign will on Tuesday lead a march to the Gauteng Legislature in Johannesburg to call for action against ANC chief whip, and former Health MEC Brian Hlongwa. The TAC is unhappy with Hlongwa’s recent election to the ANC’s Provincial Executive Committee, saying he’s implicated in a report by the Special Investigating Unit in alleged corrupt activities totaling R1.2billion during his tenure as MEC between 2006 and 2009. The TAC also slammed the election of another former Health MEC Qedani Mahlangu to the PEC, saying she must face the music for her role in the Life Esidimeni tragedy. TAC General Secretary Anele Yawa says he’s also disappointed that Premier David Makhura has not responded to a letter of grievances delivered to him two weeks ago. “We’re marching to the Gauteng Legislature to the Premier of Gauteng to say the state of healthcare in your province has collapsed. Qedani Mahlangu has been elected to the PEC that you’re leading as the chairperson of the governing party in Gauteng. And you also have Brian Hlongwa as a PEC member and as an MPL, yet you’re saying to the people thuma mina. We’re saying to him now there are a number of issues that have led to the collapse of Gauteng, but you’ve got Qedani Mahlangu, you’ve got Brian Hlongwa, what have you done about them so far.”
