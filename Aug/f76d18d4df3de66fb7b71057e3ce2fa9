While South Africans have embraced the message of moving towards a green economy, more can still be done to reduce our carbon footprint and the impact of climate change. This is according to Environmental Affairs Minister Edna Molewa. She was speaking at a National Dialogue in Midrand, Johannesburg. The effects of climate change, seen in the ever-changing weather patterns, often negatively impact society’s most vulnerable. South Africa has a number of programmes to deal with this phenomenon. This is ahead of the Climate Change Conference in Poland in December this year. Stakeholders are meeting regularly to share experiences on how to mitigate climate change. “More needs to be done and there are serious challenges in the road ahead. Climate change is one of these key challenges and it poses the single biggest threat to development with its widespread and unprecedented impacts that disproportionately burden the poorest and most vulnerable. It is therefore essential that all South Africans work together to address this challenge and that we deepen and broaden our national conversation on how best to achieve a just transition to a low carbon and climate resilient world,” says Molewa. As the world continues to move towards a more green and eco-friendly economy, a Climate Change Bill is being worked on. It is expected to be finalised in the next few months.
