Parents whose children would be attending Grades 1 and 8 in Gauteng next year are urged to respond immediately once they receive SMSs with placement offers. The provincial education department is sending out the SMSs to parents who applied for their children on the online system as it begins placing learners. The department has received over 500 000 applications. It previously expressed frustrations with parents who continue to ignore the messages, which leads to delays in placing the learners. Spokesperson Steve Mabona says they’re also aware of some parents who’ve been logging onto their website only to find that their applications are still pending. “In that instance, parents are encouraged to be patient, because the process started today and some of the schools are still continuing with the approval process. But we just need to put the emphasis that the parents that have already received the offers, within seven working days they need to accept or reject those offers because if you don’t do that, we’ll consider the next parent that is in line,” says Mabona.
