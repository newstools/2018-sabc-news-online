AfriForum Head of Community Safety, Ian Cameron says the civil group reported Malema to the police following a video that went viral on social media showing the EFF leader discharging what looks like a rifle in public during the party’s 5th anniversary in Eastern Cape over the weekend.

Cameron says they have also added the EFF Chief of Security who handed Malema the gun to their charge sheet. Watch for more:
