The Gauteng Department of Health has confirmed that the strike at the Chris Hani Baragwanath hospital in Soweto is over. This follows a meeting with labour unions on Monday night where it was agreed that their grievances would be attended to. The workers at the hospital accuse the management of corruption, maladministration and nepotism. They also demand the removal of the CEO. The CEO has since been placed on special leave. Acting Director General for Hospital Services, Dr Medupi Modisane says, “There is an agreement in place between the departments, the representatives of labour unions, that all workers will be back this morning, meaning the hospital would be fully functional. All the departments of the hospital will be running. The communities can come to Bara like before, they would be assisted. The issues that led to the strike are still on the table and there are continuous engagements on those.”
