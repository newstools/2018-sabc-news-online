EFF leader Julius Malema says women’s earnings in the workplace must be equal to that of men. He was addressing the EFF’s Women’s Day Rally in Pietermaritzburg, KwaZulu Natal. Malema has called for companies that exploit women to be exposed. “Women are equal to us and therefore, they must earn the same salary for as long as we are doing the same job. They must not be a threat to us. Any company that is isolating women and giving them salaries that are not equivalent to men because they are women, those companies must be identified publicly and we should expose them and say these are the companies which are continuing to exploit our women.” EFF members and supporters, mainly young women, packed the Caluza Sports Centre as part of celebrating the national Women’s Day. Malema and other senior party officials are  addressing issues such as the scourge of the abuse women and children suffer. EFF Deputy Secretary General, Hlengiwe Mkhaliphi, says unlike in 1956, women today are faced with challenges like abuse, poverty and unemployment. “We know that in SA we are facing so many challenges. Especially, our young women are killed and raped by people, especially by people who are supposed to love and care for them. You will remember that in 1956 our women stood up and said no against the pass laws in SA, but today’s challenges are different from those challenges. We see poverty, unemployment … we see abuse that are still happening in South Africa.” Watch video below:
