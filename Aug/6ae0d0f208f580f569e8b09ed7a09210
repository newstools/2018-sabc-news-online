The Democratic Alliance (DA) on Monday delivered a packaged video of leader Mmusi Maimane speaking on land reform to the SABC. According to the DA this follows the public broadcaster’s refusal to grant the DA’s request for a right of reply to the ANC President Cyril Ramaphosa’s  recent late-night announcement that his party supports land expropriation without compensation. According to statement the party said, “We will give the SABC until midnight on Wednesday, 8 August 2018, to air this packaged content. This is not just about the content of the broadcast but the principle that the public broadcaster must uphold.” The SABC’s Board Chair Bongumusa Makhathini’s  response to the request, :”The SABC as a responsible public service broadcaster, made efforts to deliver a balanced story by soliciting reactions from other political parties, including the Democratic Alliance. In fact the Democratic Alliance represented by the Spokesperson for the leader of the DA, was on Morning Live today responding to this story.” The DA however said having a spokesperson on Morning Live is simply not enough. The statement by the DA further says that the BCCSA has received the DA’s complaint regarding this matter and we will now wait for the SABC’s response.
