A case against a 19 year old double murder suspect, accused of strangling to death a school girl and hanging another at the girls school hostel in Stella in the North West, has been postponed to next month for trial. Xander Bylsman, who is believed to be an ex-boyfriend of one of the two minors, allegedly sneaked into the girl’s hostel in May this year and allegedly killed them. Police say he will also be charged with defeating the ends of justice after he allegedly manipulated the crime scene to look like a suicide. Xander has twice abandoned his bail application fearing for his life. Magistrate Sophia Myers postponed the case to September. “This case is postponed to the 28 of September 2018, until then, the accused will remain in custody”. Watch below for more:
