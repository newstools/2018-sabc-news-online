Three people have been arrested on arson charges after violent protests erupted at Hout Bay. City of Cape Town Mayoral Committee Member for Safety and Security, JP Smith, says a private residence and a storeroom near the harbour were set alight. Smith says accusations of poaching have been made. “The violence apparently involved persons who are attacking officials who are believed to be involved in poaching operations during which a member of the community was shot by the police. The statement is unconfirmed and will presumably come to light during further investigation.”
