Ugandan singer-turned-politician Robert Kyagulanyi, better known as Bobi Wine, is being held at a government hospital after being re-arrested while attempting to seek medical treatment abroad. Kyagulanyi faces treason charges alongside 32 others after President Yoweri Museveni’s car window was allegedly broken by a stone earlier in August. He was released on bail on Monday, but seized by police on Thursday night at Entebbe airport, outside the capital Kampala. Bobi Wine’s supporters say that he was badly beaten and tortured while in army custody after his first arrest, and require medical treatment abroad.
