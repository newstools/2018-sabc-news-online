The African National Congress (ANC) has announced the introduction of a stimulus package to curb unemployment and create jobs.  The announcement was made by Cyril Ramaphosa, speaking in his capacity as ANC President at the conclusion of the party’s two-day National Executive Committee (NEC) Lekgotla. This follows the release of the latest unemployment figures, now up to 27.2%, compared to 26.7% in the first quarter of 2018. A number of burning issues have been discussed at the bi-annual meeting. These include the current status of the economy, job creation and land reform. The meeting has taken place at a time when unemployment remains stubbornly high. However, ANC President Cyril Ramaphosa, has been quick to allay fears. He has announced the introduction of a stimulus package, which aims to curb unemployment. It also aims to increase support for entrepreneurs and small and medium businesses as well as to create job opportunities for youths and women. Ramaphosa says this initiative will target the youth and women in townships and rural communities. To save jobs, the ANC’s Head of Economic Transformation, Enoch Godongwana, has announced protection measures to cushion certain sectors from import surges. Another burning issue which has attracted major public interest over recent months is whether Section 25 of the constitution should be amended to allow for the expropriation of land without compensation. Public hearings hosted by the Joint Constitutional Review Committee have been held in eight provinces so far. The ANC says a comprehensive land reform programme will unlock economic growth. ANC NEC member, Ronald Lamola stresses that the programme does not involve nationalisation. Click below for more on the story:
