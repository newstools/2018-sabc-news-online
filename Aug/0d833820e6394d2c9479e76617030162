Former SABC COO Hlaudi Motsoeneng’s case will resume at the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration  (CCMA) in Johannesburg Thursday. He is challenging his dismissal by the SABC arguing that it was unfair and possibly politically motivated. Motsoeneng’s academic qualifications came under scrutiny at the CCMA hearing where he argued that he was not a matric drop-out. Another contentious issue was the 90% local content. Motsoeneng’s legal counsel presented minutes of the SABC board subcommittee meeting which referred to the boards approval of the policy. SABC board member Krish Naidoo earlier insisted the board never approved of such a policy. However, former SABC Board member Dr Aaron Tshidzumba vindicated Motsoeneng saying actually the 90% local content was the board’s decision. Motsoeneng wants his position as Group Corporate Affairs executive back, to which he was transferred before his dismissal and his legal team is expected to argue why this should be.
