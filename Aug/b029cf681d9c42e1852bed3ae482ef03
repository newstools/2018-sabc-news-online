The Standing Committee on Public Accounts (Scopa) in the North West says action must be taken in all issues raised by the Auditor-General’s report on the irregular awarding of tenders under former premier Supra Mahupamelo. Earlier in August, the AG’s 2017 and 2018 report revealed that the provincial government lost more than R400 million due to such contracts. Current North West premier Job Mokgoro took over after Mahumapelo resigned in June. Boitumelo Moiloa of the provincial Scopa says all the money must be accounted for. “It can’t be that taxpayers money are used the manner in which they are used, especially in the North West Province. So we are still on that matter, we are saying as Scopa now that we have a new premier in the province we still going to make a follow up, we want the premier to come and account to that.” “We want to know how did he deal with the matters and all those things that were raised by the AG, we need to make a follow up on them.” Related video click below:
