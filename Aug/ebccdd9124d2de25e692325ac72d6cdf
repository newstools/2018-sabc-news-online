The field of engineering is still fairly male-dominated but many women have seemingly fought to get their voices heard. Leboneng Mathebula is one of the women who have joined the electrical engineering path. She is the founder of Gridbow Engineers and Technical Services. Mathebula says she constantly has to prove herself to her client that she is the right person to do the job. “It does not matter how many projects you successfully do, you always have to prove yourself.” “It’s very difficult to run any type business; it’s even harder when you are a female and harder when you are young,”  says Mathebula.
