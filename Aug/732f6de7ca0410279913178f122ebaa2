The State will oppose the bail of convicted former Northern Cape African National Congress (ANC) Chairperson, John Block and Trifecta Investments CEO Christo Scholtz on Monday. The duo is expected to apply to extend their bail at the Kimberley High Court. They are currently out on R150 000 bail. On Tuesday the Supreme Court of Appeal in Bloemfontein dismissed the appeal by Block and businessman Scholtz. The two were challenging their 15-year sentence imposed on them by the Kimberley High Court. National Prosecuting Authority spokesperson Phaladi Shuping says: “The communication that we have received from their legal representatives is that they are intending to make a bail application on Monday. “So up to so far, we know it’s only the legal representatives of Christo Scholtz who have submitted their heads of arguments. We understand that with regards to Mr John Block, his legal representative is engaged in a trial somewhere, so they requested to submit their heads of argument on Saturday midday. Our responsibility now is to prepare for bail application which we are intending to oppose.” WATCH THE RELATED VIDEO:
