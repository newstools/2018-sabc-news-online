Eskom has warned that there’s a strong probability of loadshedding on Wednesday. The power utility has implemented Stage 1 rotational load shedding citing a shortage of capacity. This comes after labour unrest, in which workers are demanding higher wages, is affecting the power supplier. Low coal supplies and alleged intimidation of non-striking workers are also causing problems. Eskom’s deputy spokesperson Dikatso Mothae says: “There is industrial action taking place at some of our sites and this has affected our operations. This is why we had to loadshed on Tuesday from 5pm until 8pm.” He says the loadshedding may continue on Wednesday morning. “At this stage we haven’t had to loadshed but we are saying that there is a high probability of loadshedding this evening during our evening peak from 5 to 9 o’clock,” adds Mothae.
