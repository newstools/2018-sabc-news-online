The Cape Chamber of Commerce has applauded businesses which have played a part in the battle to save water and defeat Day Zero. The Western Cape has been in the grips of the worst drought in more than a century, which has resulted in stringent water restrictions. A restriction of daily usage of 50 litres of water per person remains in place despite the average dam level of the six major dams in the metro increasing to above 60%. Cape Chamber of Commerce president Janine Myburgh says: “I believe it’s time to recognise the huge role the business community has played in the battle to defeat Day Zero and equip the city to deal with the future drought. “This month we have seen the announcement by Old Mutual that they have taken their whole office complex off the water grid. Last month, GrowthPoint properties took its district building in Woodstock off the grid and announced that it planned to do the same with the other buildings in the city,” Myburgh explained.
