The body of a 46-year-old man of Kanana near Rustenburg in the North West has been exhumed for the second time this year.  The man died four years ago and although an initial inquest pointed to a suicide, his loved ones remained unconvinced. They have approached the courts for intervention to allay their fears that he had not been murdered. The corpse that was dug up in February does not appear to be that of their relative. The Bafokeng Magistrate’s Court ordered a second exhumation because of inconclusive DNA results. Abey Leketi was found dead with a bullet wound to the head. Appearing to be suicide, his family accepted his death. But the family questioned certain discrepancies found on the scene. The family found that the wound to the head of the corpse – exhumed in February – was on the right. But Leketi’s wound was on the left. “The investigation that was done earlier by the police that the individual committed suicide it was not correct in fact it was a cover up. Subsequent to the investigation that happened we discovered that the individual was actually that there is a strong possibility that he was killed in his home,”  says family spokesperson, Justice Lethu. Forensic tests were inconclusive, because of a lack of DNA. As a result, the court ordered a second exhumation. “The reason for the exhumation is to determine the identity of the corpse. I can also just say that if we open a case… in this case is an inquest is not cast in stone. If at any time new evidence we are made aware of a case can change from inquest to murder. The investigation is not finalised it is in process,” says North West Police spokesperson Col Adele Myburg. The National Prosecution Authority (NPA) in the North West declined to comment. An inquest trial has been scheduled for 19 October, pending the DNA results. Watch video below:
