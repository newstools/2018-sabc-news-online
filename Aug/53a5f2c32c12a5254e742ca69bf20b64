President Cyril Ramaphosa has urged Zimbabweans and their leaders to accept the judgment by their country’s Constitutional Court which upheld President Emmerson Mnangagwa’s recent election victory. President Ramaphosa has also congratulated Mnangagwa on his victory and re-affirmed South Africa’s readiness to work with the government of Zimbabwe in the pursuit of closer political, cultural, economic and trade ties. Zimbabwe’s Constitutional Court on Friday dismissed a challenge by the opposition MDC alliance to the results of the July poll as released by the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission earlier this month. Mnangagwa is expected to be sworn in as president on Monday. Watch related videos
