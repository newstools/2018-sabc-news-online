The National Union of Metalworkers (Numsa ) has accused Eskom of negotiating in bad faith, after the power utility insisted it won’t accede to union’s demands that employees who were involved in acts of sabotage during an illegal strike not face disciplinary action. The parties have now delayed the signing of the wage agreement. The unions have accepted the latest offer which includes a R10 000 once off payment to workers who fall under the bargaining unit, plus a 7.5 % salary increase this year and another 7% for the next two years. “It is clear to all unions that the overall strategy adopted by Eskom is that they want to dismiss our members for having demonstrated during these talks. We can also confirm that as unions the only outstanding issue in this round of talks relates to disciplinary action. “However, we are very firm that we are not willing to trade the job security of our members for a wage deal. We do not promote any form of misconduct by our members, but we remain open to the use of corrective disciplinary measures other than dismissals, if there is real evidence of misconduct,” said Numsa spokesperson Phakamile Hlubi-Majola.
