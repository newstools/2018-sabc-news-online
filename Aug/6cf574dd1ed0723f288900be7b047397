Three people with alleged links to the ISIS group are on Friday due to appear in the Verulam Magistrate’s Court. This is in connection with the murder of British couple Rachel and Rodney Saunders. The British horticulturists were still missing at the time of the arrest of Safydeen Del Vecchio, his wife Fatima Patel and Malawian national Ahmed Mussa. The couple’s bodies were later found in mortuaries and positively identified through DNA tests. It’s alleged that more than R700 000 was taken from the British couple’s bank account.
