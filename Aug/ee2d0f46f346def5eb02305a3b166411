The average dam levels in the Western Cape have remained constant over the past two weeks at 51 percent. Spokesperson for the provincial Environment Ministry, James Brent-Styan, says this is an improvement from last year’s 28 percent. He says the collective dam levels of reservoirs supplying the City of Cape Town stand at almost 57 percent. “There has been hardly any change to the big picture given the warmer weather we’ve been seen and some less rainfall. We are hopeful that we’ll be getting more rain but we want to continue to urge consumers to use as little water as possible. We also want to continue to advise that behaviour change when it comes to water use needs to be of a permanent nature.”
