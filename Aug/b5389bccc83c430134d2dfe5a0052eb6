Minister of Women Bathabile Dlamini says there has to be a policy that protects women in institutions of higher learning. Dlamini was speaking at the Women’s Day celebration at the Mbekweni Youth Centre in Paarl. Referring to the death of Rhodes University Khensani Maseko, Dlamini expressed disappointment at how the institution handled the student’s matter. Maseko allegedly committed suicide after she was allegedly raped by her boyfriend who is also a student at the institution. She was buried on Thursday. Dlamini says more needs to be done to protect women in institutions of higher learning. “Women should not be raped in universities,” Dlamini says. The Minister also focused on violence against women and children. “To all the men, No means No.” Dlamini has called for dialogue on the issues affecting women. “Women issues must find expression in our daily conversations, faith-based organisations,” she explained. Dlamini also reminded the attendees of the impact struggle veteran Albertina Sisulu had in the road to democracy. “She was a hard-working and honest leader.” A Duke will be launched in honour of Albertina Sisulu. Making remarks just before President Cyril Ramaphosa took the podium, Minister Nathi Mthethwa also thanked women who played a role in the struggle against apartheid. “All the generation of women who fought for the liberation of South Africa. If it was not for them, we would not have made it to 1994.”
