Advocates Dali Mpofu and Tembeka Ngcukaitobi have arrived in Harare Zimbabwe as part of the MDC Alliance’s legal team challenging the outcome of the July 30 polls. The Constitutional Court will hear the application on Wednesday August 22. Bringing in legal heavyweights, the MDC Alliance’s legal team is bracing for a legal tussle in its Constitutional Court. MDC Alliance lawyer Nqobizitha Mlilo says, “I can confirm that advocates Dali Mpofu and Tembeka Ngcukaitobi have arrived in Harare to familiarise themselves with the MDC leadership and this is a case that ZEC will not be able to answer.” Meanwhile, at the SADC Summit where President Emmerson Mnagagwa is attending, Zimbabwe also featured as expected. Emmerson Mnagagwa says, “All political parties were free to campaign. I took it upon myself to preach the message of peace, non-violence, unity and love and this saw people freely exercising their democratic right. I am humbled by the confidence in my party that gave us victory.” Cyril Ramaphosa says, “The recent elections held in Zimbabwe which were declared by SADC observers as free and fair is a positive sign and we look forward to finalisation of the outcome in the coming days.” Rwanda is also confident that SADC will resolve the impasse. Rwanda Paul Kagame says, “SADC has accomplished this task in the past, in handling political issues in Lesotho and Madagascar and recently, in the Comoros. You will be called on to do the same as was the case in Zimbabwe. We can only be pleased that SADC and AU accompanied the political process in Zimbabwe.” The media has applied to the Constitutional Court to broadcast the proceedings that have attracted immense international attention and that decision is expected on Monday.
