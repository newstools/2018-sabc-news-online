A 35-year-old man has been arrested after he was found in a house with a 12-gauge shotgun and several rounds of ammunition in Firgrove outside Cape Town. Metro police spokesperson, Zelda Martin says they also found a dozen nine millimetre rounds in the house. Martin says a search revealed that the shotgun had been stolen from a security company in the North West in 2016. She says: “Officers received a tip-off about illegal firearms being stored at premises in Port Jackson Avenue. The officers executed a search warrant and as they entered the house, an occupant ran towards a window and threw something wrapped in a towel outside.” Officers discovered it was a loaded Protecta 12 gauge, single barrel shotgun and the man was then arrested.
