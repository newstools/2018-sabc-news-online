The Academic Professional Staff Association (APSA) wants former Higher Education minister Blade Nzimande to be probed for alleged corruption. The union says it will lay criminal charges against Nzimande and other individuals with close links to him. The association which is affiliated to the South African Federation of Trade Unions  (Saftu) is accusing Nzimande who is now Transport Minister, of using his position to appoint friends, cronies and relatives to head influential entities. Apsa’s general-secretary Professor Boitumelo Senokoane says they’re ready to present the necessary evidence. “We have approached first the Department of Education and we’ve complained about the issues that we’ve raised today. Second to that we’ve written to the minister on the issues that we’ve raised. Based on the information that is coming in, we are ready ourselves to approach the relevant bodies. So that if need be we open up criminal charges so that we make sure this issue is attended to,” says Senokoane.
