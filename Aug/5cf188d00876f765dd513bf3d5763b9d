Gautrain commuters, who have purchased weekly or monthly train passes, can be assured that they will be reimbursed if they were affected by the on-going strike. Wage negotiations at Gautrain are still deadlocked after workers embarked on a strike more than two weeks ago. Workers have lowered their basic salary demand from a 10% increase to 9% plus an incentive. Gautrain operating company, Bombela has been offering workers 8, 5% salary increase and other benefits. Gautrain is still operating at reduced service as the strike continues. Gautrain spokesperson Kesagee Nayagar says the Hatfiled Gautrain station has also been reopened. “Passengers who have purchased a weekly or monthly train product and have been unable to utilise this as a result of the strike will be fully reimbursed and the admin fee will not apply. From Monday 13 August Hatfield station will be reopened during peak hours and trains will travel between Hatfield and Park Station. Passengers travelling on this route will no longer be required to change trains at Sandton. The afternoon peak has been extended and it will commence at 3:30pm and end at 7pm,” says Nayagar.
