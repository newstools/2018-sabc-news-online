The trial of six Nedbank robbery suspects, who posed as SBV security officers on a routine cash pick-up, is expected to resume in the Klerksdorp Magistrateâ€™s Court on Thursday. In their last court appearance they were granted bail ranging from R20 000 to R30 000 each. The robbers stole R3 million from the bank. Welcome Marcus and five co-accused, who hail from Johannesburg, were arrested by both North West and Gauteng police. The suspects, who were dressed in SBV security uniform, entered the bank and collected cash after producing false credentials earlier this year.
