The National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) has expressed anger and shock over Eskom’s decision to axe 7000 employees by the year 2023. The job bombshell comes at a tense time during continued wage negotiations with unions, which have brought back load shedding over a two-month period. NUM energy sector co-ordinator Paris Mashego says Eskom announced the retrenchments over the next five years through “voluntary packages”, without proper consultation. “We have not been officially informed, there was no consultation at all. What we saw was a statement from a senior manager at Eskom who announced that 7000 workers would be given voluntary packages for a period of five years. We are a little bit angered that this senior manager went ahead and made such a clumsy announcement which has angered managers on the ground,” says Mashego. Watch related videos below
