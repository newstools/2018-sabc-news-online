Private rhino breeders in North West are calling for tougher policing and prosecution to counter the growing number of rhino poached in the province. While the country has seen a drop in rhino poaching numbers, significant increases have been noted in Limpopo and the North West with Pilanesberg Game Reserve also suffering huge losses. Private Rhino Breeder Jacques Swanepoel says: “The last four years we lost eight rhinos and since April we have already lost R1.2 million. It is three animals in one week.” “Last year, we caught three poachers and they received R500 bail so it is just a losing battle for us,” adds Swanepoel. Meanwhile the police say all systems are in place to fight the complex problem of rhino poaching in the province. A significant increase in rhino poaching has been noted in Limpopo and the North West with Pilanesberg Game Reserve being badly affected. Police Spokesperson Adele Myburg says they are hard at work with other stakeholders and police units. She says: “We have a specialised task team at our local criminal records centres that do all the forensic testing and we work hand in hand with the parks board. So I do not agree with the statement that the police are doing nothing. Related video
