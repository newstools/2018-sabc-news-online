Zimbabwe will on Tuesday commemorate Defence Force’s Day. President Emmerson Mnangagwa who’s victory is being challenged in the Constitutional Court is expected to preside over the official ceremony in Harare. The Defence Force’s Day comes two weeks after violence broke out in the Harare CBD. MDC supporters had protested against the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC) results which declared Mnangagwa the winner. Soldiers were roped in and clashed with the protesters and six people were killed during the clashes. Many criticized the army for their heavy hand when dealing with the protestors and as the commander in Chief, Mnangagwa is expected to touch on that incident. He has also pledged to do things differently as there are still challenges of mind set especially in government institutions. WATCH RELATED VIDEO BELOW:
