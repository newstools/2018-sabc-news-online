The Black Academic Caucus at the University of Cape Town (UCT) wants the institution’s council to set up an inquiry into the tragic death of Professor Bongani Mayosi. The world renowned cardiologist took his own life last week, after grappling with depression for more than two years following the #FeesMustFall protests. Family, colleagues and students gathered at the Jameson Memorial Hall to remember Mayosi. Spokesperson, Dr Tiri Chinyoka, says an inquiry will bring closure. “We hope to achieve a collective understanding from the UCT community as to what are the circumstances that led to Professor Mayosi to take the he took. What we know is that black students especially have to face those kinds of decisions”.  Click for related video:
