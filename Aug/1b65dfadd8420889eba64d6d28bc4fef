Higher Education Minister Naledi Pandor has assured students at institutions of higher learning that, the resignation of NSFAS (National Student Financial Aid Scheme) chairperson Sizwe Nxasana will not affect their 2019 funding. Nxasana confirmed his resignation from the organisation on Thursday. NSFAS has come under fire after Minister Pandor instructed the scheme to halt funding for 2019 students because of a backlog in disbursing aid for 2017 and this year. Pandor has however clarified this. “There’s some sensation that students will not be funded for 2019. They will be funded. The board has elected a chairperson who I have confirmed appointment of, Professor Neil Garret. No student should find themselves without allowances, unable to eat, unable to study properly because they do not have books. These are terrible things that should not have happened, and we are giving every effort to ensure that we overcome this problem.” Watch for more:
