Crowds have to gather at the Mbekweni Youth Centre in Paarl where the national Women’s Day celebration is taking place this Thursday. Buses from different locations have been dropping off people and they are queuing to get inside the venue. Women’s Day is recognised in South Africa to remember the march by more than 20 000 women to the Union Buildings in 1956. The women wanted the pass laws to be scrapped. This year’s event is celebrated under the theme: ” Woman of Fortitude: Women United in Moving South Africa Forward.” President Cyril Ramaphosa is expected to deliver the main speech of the day. Other dignitaries who are expected to attend the event include Western Cape Premier Helen Zille, anti-apartheid activist Sophie De Bryn who was also part of the 1956 women’s march and Minister of Women Bathabile Dlamini. Residents of Thembani Square, an informal settlement opposite the youth centre hope that in his speech, the President will touch on some of the challenges which they face.  The residents want proper sanitation, access to water, skills development and jobs.
