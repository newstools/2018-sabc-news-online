The African National Congress in Limpopo has rebuffed allegations of corruption and power-mongering against its Treasurer, Danny Msiza. A widely circulated email alleges that Msiza is behind the 10 municipalities in the province investing with the troubled VBS Mutual Bank. The municipalities have invested more than a billion rand with the mutual bank which has since been placed under curatorship. ANC Limpopo provincial spokesperson Donald Selamolela says investigations around the VBS saga are continuing. “We want to condemn the lie by peddlers who continue to want to divide the society over this VBS matter. We’ve called on investigations on this matter by the relevant authorities and we have equally sanctioned our own internal investigations on this particular matter.” “We want to condemn this type of operation because they seek to undermine the current investigation that is taking place and they seek to pre-empt the outcome of this particular investigation and very soon we’ll know who are the culprits and what action is going to be taken to those particular culprits.” Related video click below:
