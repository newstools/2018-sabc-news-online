Public Protector Advocate Busi Mkhwebane says she is growing increasingly frustrated with Treasury for not implementing the Public Protector’s remedial actions over pension pay-outs to the former Venda homeland employees. Her predecessor Thuli Madonsela recommended that beneficiaries of the Venda Pension be paid funds due to them. Mkhwebane is in Limpopo as part of her office’s nationwide road shows. Mkhwebane is critical of Treasury and says she will write to the Speaker of Parliament about the pay outs. More than 25 000 people stand to benefit. “Ministers have to respect the Constitution and the National Assembly can also oversee their performance. They have an oversight role in terms of the Constitution. I must say I am frustrated because this is impacting gravely on those pensioners.” Meanwhile, the people of Driekop, which boasts two Chrome and Platinum mines, have accused the state and the mining industry of failing in their corporate social responsibility. Driekop resident Abel Mnisi says:”The community of Driekop has lots of minerals but people are poor and not benefiting anything.” Mkhwebane concludes her visits to the province on Thursday.
