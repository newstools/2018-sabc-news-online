The SACP has vowed to campaign to keep the ANC in power after the 2019 general elections. The party celebrated its 97th anniversary in East London on Sunday amid talks on a reconfiguration of the alliance that would see the party contest state power. However, SACP’s first Deputy Secretary General, Solly Mapaila made it clear that they would close ranks to defend the revolution under the ANC banner. Mapaila says the alliance needs to act in the interest of the masses. He says: “We can’t allow a situation where our timing is out of sync with revolutionary time. So we can’t nurse wrongdoing just because we want to build unnecessary unity, when the very same forces are mobilising against our own movement so that they can bargain to remain in power. So that they can stay out of prosecution because we don’t want to act. Every time we act we should act in the interest of the working class and the people of our country.” Mapaila also lashed out at the country’s capitalist system that he says disadvantages the working class. He was critical of the talks to privatise Eskom. “We are also aware of the intention to sabotage energy security in this country, particularly by the looters that were at Eskom. Some of them have been booted out and they want to continue using their connections to ensure that they paralyse us. “We need energy security in this country and there should be no compromise in that regard and we must not take some desperate steps in trying to make sure that we are not sabotaged by thinking that the solution is to sell Eskom,” Mapaila defended.
