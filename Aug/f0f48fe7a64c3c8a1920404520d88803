The United Democratic Movement (UDM) in the Eastern Cape says it’s all systems go for its provincial elective conference scheduled for this weekend. The conference will be held at Zingisa High school in Mthatha, and close to 1 500 delegates will participate. SABC News understands that the provincial chairmanship position will be hotly contested as current chairperson, Luthando Mpulu, Zama Mqolo and Mongameli Bobani are vying for the position. UDM provincial spokesperson Mabandla Gogo says the conference is part of the party’s preparations for the upcoming 2019 election. “We will all know by this meeting which we will be convened between the PEC and national leaders today as to who will be contesting officially because nomination forms were sent straight to national. So I am not in a position to divulge names at this stage because names were sent to national as nominations for this position”.
