Transport Minister, Blade Nzimande says there are no immediate plans to scrap the controversial e-tolling system in Gauteng. Last month, Gauteng African National Congress (ANC) chairperson, David Makhura said the party would be leading the campaign to scrap e-tolls. Opposition parties and civil society have been demanding that e-tolls, which were introduced in 2013, should be scrapped. Nzimande says South African National Roads Agency Limited (Sanral) has no other way to pay for the highways it has already built. “The e-tolls now, we are having extensive discussions and we understand the public sentiment. But at the same time we have got another problem. We owe an amount of R67 billion on the building of these wonderful freeways. The issue is who is going to pay, and how are we going to pay? If you take away the e-tolls now, we are not saying we are or we are not….  How do you pay the R67 billion ? Do you increase the fuel levy? Already there is a huge outcry that the fuel prices are high, legitimately so. So we can’t just discuss this issue on the sentiment that people do not want e-tolls,” says Nzimande.
