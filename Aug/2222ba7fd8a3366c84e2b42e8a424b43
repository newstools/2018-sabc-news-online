The South African Communist Party has called on government to find other measures to raise funds for the National Health Insurance scheme than increasing taxation against poor workers. SACP members marched to Pelonomi hospital in Bloemfontein on Saturday to hand over a memorandum of demands. SACP first deputy general-secretary Solly Mapaila says the party supports the NHI. “Here at Pelonomi as you can see the two hospitals are joint, one is private and one is public. The public hospital has long ques. Some patients share a bed but just a few metres away some beds are empty overnight. This other one has better facilities than the other. But both hospitals are subsidized by government.”
