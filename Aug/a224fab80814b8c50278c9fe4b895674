Department of Arts and Culture has kick-started Women’s Day celebrations by honouring struggle icon the late Mama Albertina Sisulu who also, like former President Nelson Mandela, would have turned 100 years old this year. The Sisulu Centenary Celebration at the Cape Peninsula University of Technology Bellville Campus involved Panel Discussion which analysed her life and times and the role she played to ensure gender balance in the society. The late Albertina Sisulu, a political activist and the wife of former Robben Island Political Prisoner and struggle stalwart Walter Sisulu joined struggle for freedom at a very young age. The speakers took turns remembering the contribution and impact people like Mama Sisulu had in shaping young generations. Deputy Minister for Communications, Pinky Kekana says, “What is important and what we see missing is that level of mentoring.” Albertina Sisulu’s granddaughter Nontsikelelo Sisulu says, “Mama Albertina Sisulu was very passionate about education and young people in particular. She turned her home into a school trying to avoid young people facing the brunt and the negative effects of Bantu Education and when the police found out they shut that down. She made sure that whenever she sent a child out to exile she sent them with one message ‘get an education’.” Watch related video below:
