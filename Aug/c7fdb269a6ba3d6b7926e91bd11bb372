Zimbabwe’s newly elected President, Emmerson Mnangagwa, will be sworn in at an elaborate ceremony in the capital, Harare on Sunday. Government officials say the daylong event will begin at 10 o’clock in the morning. Mnangagwa’s inauguration comes after the constitutional court upheld his election win. This was the first election after the end of Robert Mugabe’s 37-year rule, which was marked by rigged elections. The MDC-Alliance leader Nelson Chamisa has rejected the court ruling. He’s now taking his fight to the African Commission on Human and People’s Rights, which is known as the Banjul Commission, to challenge Friday’s constitutional court decision. However, Mnangagwa has extended an olive branch to him. Watch related videos:
