The Constitutional Court will on Wednesday rule on granting the Independent Electoral Commission a further 17 months extension to update the voters’ roll. The electoral body says since the Constitutional Court’s 2016 judgment in this regard, it has managed to reduce the number of voters without addresses to about 1.2 million. They require 17 more months to complete this task. The commission currently has until November the 30th this year to comply. National and provincial elections are due to be held around the middle of next year.
