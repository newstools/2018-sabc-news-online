The Mpumalanga government led by Premier Refilwe Mtshweni will on Wednesday meet the protesting residents of KaNyamazane outside Mbombela. The protest action is in its third day. The residents want their houses which were damaged by a hailstorm in May to be fixed speedily. The governmentâ€™s attempts at stopping the protest action on Tuesday failed. The residents barricaded roads with burning tyres, metal objects and other debris including stones. One of the ward councillors, Dan Mkhatshwa says it was difficult for him as a councillor to get information only to be told that can only be shared with certain individuals. Police are on the scene monitoring the situation. Related video:
