The water levels of dam supplying Cape Town have increased to 62% following good rains over the weekend. Local Government Ministry spokesperson, James-Brent Styan says the collective dam levels across the Western Cape stands at 55% compared to 16% in April this year. Styan says the water-stressed Karoo however remains a concern. He says large areas of the Karooo, Oudtshoorn and Beaufort West remain in serious trouble with very little surface water left at the moment. “The Gouritzs river catchment area, which includes some of the areas in the Karoo and Angkloof, has an average dam level of 18%, so that remains a massive concern for us,” says Styan.
