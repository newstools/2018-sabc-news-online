KwaZulu-Natal Transport MEC, Mxolisi Kaunda says a task team has been set-up to consider possible safety measures which can be put in place on the R66 between Melmoth and Eshowe where five people were killed in a bus crash on Saturday. The team will include the departmentâ€™s engineers. Kaunda, Co-operative Government and Traditional Affairs MEC Nomusa Dube-Ncube and ANC secretary-general Ace Magashule visited the crash scene earlier on Sunday. Kaunda has urged motorists to be cautious on the stretch of road where the crash happened. The deceased who are members of the 12 Apostolic Church include a seven-month-old child. The crash happened after the driver lost control of the vehicle, causing it to overturn. It occurred on the notorious Ndundulu bends near Nkwalini, where more than 10 maidens were killed in 2013 when their bus overturned. Watch for more:
