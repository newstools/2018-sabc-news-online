Cape Town Mayor Patricia De Lille says while she has cleared her name in the Democratic Alliance (DA), she still awaits the outcome of the separate investigation against her by the City of Cape Town. She says she has also not taken a decision on whether to remain a Councillor in the City of Cape Town or not. De Lille was speaking to the media following a joint media briefing where she and DA Leader Mmusi Maimane announced her resignation. The DA has agreed to drop all internal disciplinary charges against her, but the investigations by the City will continue. “These are separate processes. It is always that the party had mixed the two. No separation between party and state. So the investigation in the City will continue. In fact where we are now with the process is that they are still investigating. Then they must come back and then they must make a recommendation to council whether they found enough evidence to actually discipline me, that’s where we are at the moment. So I will wait for the outcome of that investigation and hear what the recommendations are and take it from there,” says De Lille. Meanwhile, Maimane says the process to elect a new Mayor for the City of Cape Town will start immediately. He says De Lille’s resignation will become effective on the 31 October. “And what we will do as a party we will make sure that we begin the process of electing a new Mayor with immediate effect. I also want to state that the DA has made a decision to withdraw all internal disciplinary charges against Patricia de Lille. Any other investigations that are taking place in the City fall outside this particular agreement.” Click below for more on the story:
