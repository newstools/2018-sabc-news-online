The University of Cape Town says a lecturer from its Chemical Engineering Department will face a disciplinary hearing for a derogatory post he made on Facebook. Arthur Mabantsela made an allegedly sexist and criminally disturbing post on Facebook which led to an outcry on social media. The university says the content of the post is grave, unacceptable and completely out of alignment with UCT values. UCT spokesperson, Elijah Moholola says the University is investigating the matter. “Whatever comes out of the investigation becomes part of the evidence that will be tabled as part of the hearing. So we are going to go through processes, the hearing and the investigation. Meanwhile what the university has done, the lecturer has been requested to not continue with any teaching commitments, so he’s not teaching any classes at the moment”. However, the DA Students Organisation at UCT has called on the institution to immediately fire a Mabantsela. DASO Chairperson at UCT, Neo Mkwane says they are shocked at the utterances made in the post. He says Mabantsela’s behaviour has also brought the good name of UCT into disrepute. “We believe that he must be fired. The University must put it to him that he should vacate his position as an academic lecturer. In class he teaches female students and students of different races and we cannot expect the University to keep someone who made such terrible comments about women”.
