The Democratic Alliance (DA) has committed itself to helping women who are victims of sexual exploitation in the workplace. This as the DA Women’s Network (Dawn) celebrates Women’s Month by leading a march under the theme Fighting Against Sexual Exploitation for Jobs in Bethal, Mpumalanga. Dawn Chairperson Annerie Weber says the issue of unemployment has created new opportunities for men to exploit women. Weber says women should be employed for their skills and competence. “It is inhumane to use the desperation of unemployed women for your own gain. It leaves women devastated and degraded, stripping them of their dignity.  Women deserve fair access to jobs based on skills and competence, not being exposed to doing sexual favour in trade for a job to a sick perverse perpetrator,’ says Weber. Weber adds that the party will protect women who speak up against their perpetrators. “Dawn will not sit back while women are exploited by perverted officials who abuse their positions of power and take advantage of the women’s desperation for employment. We as DAWN want every woman to know that you are not alone. In the DA you have an ally you can count on if you choose to speak up and expose your perpetrator.”
