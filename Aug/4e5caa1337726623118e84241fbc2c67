Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) caucus leader in the City of Cape Town, Melikhaya Xego says the DA has avoided its dirty linen being exposed by outgoing Cape Town Mayor Patricia De Lille in an open disciplinary hearing. Xego was reacting to the news that De Lille and the DA have reached an agreement to resign as Mayor and to drop internal disciplinary charges against her. The announcement came just a day before the public disciplinary hearing was expected to take place on Monday and Tuesday(6 & 7 August). Xego says the EFF is shocked that the DA decided to settle with someone they publicly portrayed as corrupt. He says: “The fact that De Lille pronounced that she is prepared to do a public hearing so that everybody should be aware of the dynamics regarding the case, then the DA decides to reach a settlement with somebody they portrayed to the public as corrupt. It is quite clear that there is something that De Lille has on the Democratic Alliance that is very big, to a point that a party that is claiming to run a clean governance is prepared to settle with a corrupt person.”
