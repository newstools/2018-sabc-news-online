Labour union National Union of Mineworkers has confirmed that Eskom employees who participated in the protracted wage strike will not be dismissed. It is not clear whether the employees will go through a disciplinary process or not. NUM and National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa have also announced that they have signed a wage agreement with the power utility in the early hours of this morning, ending protracted wage negotiations. The agreement is for three years and would see an increase of seven-point-five percent this year and seven percent over the next two years. A R10 000 once off payment would also be made to employees who participated in the bargaining forum. “Negotiation is still ongoing with Eskom management but one thing that I can put on record is that there is not going to be dismissals of NUM members and that is why the NUM signed an agreement in the early hours of this morning at around 1 this morning,” says NUM spokesperson Livhuwani Mamburu.
