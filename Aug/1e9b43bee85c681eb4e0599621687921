A statement reported to be from the Zimbabwe Minister of Justice has cast doubt on whether Advocates Dali Mpofu and Tembeka Ngcukaitobi will be able to represent the MDC Alliance’s Nelson Chamisa. Mpofu and Ngcukaitobi are expected to form part of Chamisa’s election outcome in the Constitutional Court on Wednesday. However the statement says South Africa does not meet the test of reciprocity to exempt its lawyers to practice in Zimbabwe. The lawyers are still expected to travel back to Harare on Tuesday to be part of the team. The Zimbabwe Electoral Commission is arguing in its answering papers that Chamisa did not file and serve them all his papers on time, therefore the power of the court to hear the application has not been invoked. Also the evidence submitted after the seven day deadline should be inadmissible But Chamisa is adamant the court has jurisdiction, and calls on the international community to keep an eye on Zimbabwe to ensure justice But for now eyes remain in the process to allow his imported legal minds into the Constitutional Court. While there is still no formal answer, their travel back to Harare will speak volumes about their understanding of their permission to work. Click video below:
