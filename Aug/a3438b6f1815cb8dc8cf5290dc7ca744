SA Communist Party (SACP) General Secretary, Blade Nzimande, says the alliance needs an inclusive campaign to help win the upcoming 2019 elections. Last year, the SACP threatened to leave the African National Congress (ANC) tripartite alliance due to their dissatisfaction with former President Jacob Zuma being in power. The SACP now says that a reconfigured alliance will help the ANC win the elections. Nzimande addressed the media following the SACP central committee’s three-day meeting in Johannesburg. “The ANC guidelines do not detract from the fact that the ANC is aware of what needs to be done if we are to have a united alliance going into the elections. This matter is officially on the table of discussions of the alliance and we agreed that the major item of the forthcoming summit will be on this issue of reconfiguration. We all have a responsibility that we must run an inclusive election campaign. We need alliance partners to have more of a say. In fact we need a reconfigured alliance to emphatically win the elections. ” The party  says it fully supports the state capture probe which gets underway in Parktown on Monday. Nzimande says there seems to be a fight back by those who benefited from State Capture and this is directed at all South Africans. WATCH VIDEO BELOW:
