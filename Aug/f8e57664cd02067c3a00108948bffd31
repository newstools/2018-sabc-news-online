The Department of Energy is expected to announce another fuel price increase during the weekend which the Automobile Association (AA) has warned will take to record high levels next month. The AA attributes the expected hikes to the weakening of the rand and increases in international oil prices, which have jumped by around ten percent in the last month. The AA says they expect all grades of petrol to increase next month. “With the increases that we are predicting going into September it is just going to take then further into those ranges. We are looking at around R16 a litre or more for 93 unleaded inland which is going to take it over that R16 for the first time ever and that is a physiological barrier, the fuel across the country is just at record highs,” says the AA’s Layton Beard.
