NASA will again attempt to launch a mission to explore the Sun 24-hours after the previous launch was delayed due to a last-minute technical problem. The Parker Solar Probe, an unmanned spacecraft worth over R19 billion, will aim to get closer than any human-made object in history to the centre of our solar system. The probe is designed to plunge into the Sun’s mysterious atmosphere during a seven-year mission. It’s protected by an ultra-powerful heat shield that can endure unprecedented levels of heat. The car-sized probe is designed to give scientists a better understanding of solar wind and geomagnetic storms that risk wreaking chaos on Earth by knocking out the power grid. Meanwhile NASA has dismissed one of its employees for causing panic among residents in the state of New Jersey. Earlier this week a suspicious package fell from the sky in New Brunswick.
