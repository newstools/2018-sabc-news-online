Zimbabweans are dealing with the inevitable; the presidential inauguration will not go ahead as planned on Sunday, pending the determination of the Constitutional Court. The opposition MDC-Alliance lodged a court bid to overturn the results that gave a narrow victory for incumbent president, Emmerson Mnangagwa. The MDC alleges widespread irregularities. Lawyers for MDC leader, Nelson Chamisa say he’s requested that the court to nullify the July the 30th vote resulting in Mnangagwa’s swearing-in being halted. It was first election since Robert Mugabe was forced to resign after a coup in November. “We do know that this inauguration that was expected today will definitely not be happening. The MDC-Alliance filed an application in court on Friday contesting the results.” “They say that they’ve got a case and they want, what they say is a problem, to be heard in the court. We are expecting a response from the Con-Court in the next few days.” Experts in Zimbabwe say this could take place in the next 14 days if the Con-Court says it will hear the case. Click video below:
