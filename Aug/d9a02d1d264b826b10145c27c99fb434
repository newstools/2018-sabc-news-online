The Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (Outa) says it is optimistic that the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture will gather enough information to prove the existence of state capture. The first witness in the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture is expected to testify on Tuesday. National Treasury Chief Procurement officer, Ndleleni Mathebula has been announced as the first witness. Mathebula is expected to give evidence on procurement processes and whether they were flouted in the department. The commission officially kicked off its proceedings in Parktown, Johannesburg on Monday. Outa Chief Executive Officer, Wayne Duvenhage says, “There will be sufficient information to show that there has been a matter of state capture. It will be interesting to see how it will flow from there. We’ll be making the submissions over the next few weeks and other organisations are doing the same. I think we’ll get sufficient information as I see we put a report together that we gave to Parliament last year and have now substituted.” Click below for related video:
