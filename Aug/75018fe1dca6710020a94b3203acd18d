Rescue teams are searching for three Kwa Zulu-Natal Sharks Board employees who are thought to be missing after their boat got into difficulties earlier Wednesday morning off Richards Bay on the province’s north coast. They are thought to have been carrying out routine maintenance of the nets when their boat reportedly capsized. Police search and rescue and National Sea Rescue Institute are on the scene. NSRI spokesperson Craig Lambanon says a helicopter is conducting an air search. “NSRI in Richards Bay is currently conducting a rescue operation where a boat had been reportedly capsized in the surf. At this stage there is an ongoing operation. We don’t want to speculate anything other than, just that NSIR services are in attendance and ongoing operations are being conducted”.
