South African Express is expected to be back in the air soon. SA Express was grounded in May this year due to safety issues. Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan has told Parliament that everything necessary has been done for the airline to resume its flights. He says aircraft from SA Express could be flying as early as next week. However, Gordhan has cautioned that the company is still facing liquidity challenges despite a government guarantee of R1.7 billion. “We are in a happy situation where all of the processes that are necessary to get it flying again have been concluded and the first flight should begin sometime next week so that’s a huge achievement.” Click related video:
