Residents of Lawley south of Johannesburg are protesting against what they say is an impending land invasion in the area. It’s understood the community doesn’t want an open piece of land to be occupied by people who want to build shacks on it. Police spokesperson Kay Makhubele says community members have blocked the road and they are refusing to allow these people to come and erect their shacks in an open space next to them. He says: “Police have been deployed in the area and they are monitoring the situation. There are no reported injuries or damage to property.” Police will continue monitoring the situation.
