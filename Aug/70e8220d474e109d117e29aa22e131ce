Cape Town’s already struggling rail service has suffered yet another setback.  A train carriage has been gutted by a fire at the Koeberg station in Maitland. At least 15 coaches have been destroyed by fire in recent weeks, in incidents allegedly linked to sabotage. On-going attacks and vandalism have reduced the number of train sets available to nearly half of Metro rail’s needs to operate an efficient service. Damages are estimated to run into tens of millions of rand. The continued destruction of rail infrastructure not only affects the thousands of commuters dependent on it, it’s also having a significant impact on businesses. One person has so far been detained and questioned after he allegedly started a fire on an empty train at Cape Town station in July. Metrorail says no injuries were reported on Tuesday morning incident. Watch related videos below
