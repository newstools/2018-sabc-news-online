Emmerson Mnangagwa has been sworn in as the President of Zimbabwe at an elaborate inauguration ceremony at Harare’s National Stadium. Thousands of supporters have turned up for the event, as well as several African leaders. These include President Cyril Ramaphosa, Zambia’s leader Edgar Lungu  AU chairperson, President Paul Kagame of Rwanda  and Lesotho’s Prime Minister, Thomas Thabane. Opposition MDC Alliance leader Nelson Chamisa and his supporters boycotted the event, as they believe Mnangagwa was unfairly elected and plan to challenge his victory in an African Union court.
