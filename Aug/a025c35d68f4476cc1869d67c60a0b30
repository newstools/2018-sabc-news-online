Public hearings into the Customary Initiation Bill aimed at regulating the practice of circumcision begin on Monday with the Eastern Cape – the first province to host them. Parliament will hear the views of the people starting in Port Elizabeth. Chairperson of the National Assembly’s Portfolio Committee on Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs, Richard Mdakane says provinces already have their own legislation regulating circumcision and initiation schools. He however says the recent deaths of initiates mean the envisaged bill at national level is needed. “One person dying in initiation schools is one too many. We should not be allowing anyone to die because no culture in the world is allowed the freedom to do things that will end up taking the life of another,” says Mdakane. “All cultures evolve and are informed by the conditions or the political situation in the country. No one can say my culture can not change,” adds Mdakane. WATCH RELATED VIDEO BELOW:
