The busy N7 on the Cape West Coast is still closed to traffic following Sunday morning’s head-on collision between two passenger vehicles just outside of Cape Town in which three men have died. Three other occupants have been injured of which one is in a critical condition. Western Cape Traffic chief, Kenny Africa, says the highway is closed in both directions between Philadelphia and Dassenberg where the crash occurred. Emergency workers are still busy clearing the scene. Africa says it’s unknown at this stage what could have led to the fatal crash. He says: “It was a head-on collision between a BMW and a golf. Three people lost their lives, two were injured and another passenger was seriously injured.”
