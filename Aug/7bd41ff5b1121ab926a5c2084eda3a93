Johannesburg water is urging residents to use water sparingly, as reservoirs are beginning to run dry. This is as a result of a City Power substation that caught fire in Eikenhof, resulting in a power outage. This outage has affected the Eikenhof Pump station which is causing a major water supply disruption. Areas affected include Roodepoort, Randburg, Langlaagte, Southdale and Soweto. Several hospitals are also at risk of water cuts including Wilgeheuwel, Flora Clinic, Olivedale, Helen Joseph, Rahima Moosa and Chris Hani Baragwanath. Joburg Water spokesperson Isaac Dhludhlu says they appeal to the residents to be patient and use water carefully. “From Joburg Water side, our reservoirs are dropping at a very high rate, now quite a number of areas are running out of water. We are also trying to activate tankers around all the affected areas; it’s quite a vast area. It might take longer for everyone to get assistance; we have already got about 20 tankers that are roaming around.”
