Eskom insists that disciplinary action will be taken against employees who embarked on an illegal strike as the power utility is regarded as an essential service. This despite the unions demanding that no disciplinary action be taken against striking workers. Last week, National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (Numsa) threatened to withdraw from wage talks with Eskom after accusing them of negotiating in bad faith. This has resulted in the parties delaying the signing of their wage agreement. The unions have accepted the latest offer which includes a R10 000 once off payment to workers who fall under the bargaining unit, plus a 7.5% salary increase this year and another 7% for the next two years. Eskom spokesperson Dikatso Mothae says: “The past two waves of industrial action that the unions have undertaken have been unlawful, illegal strikes. The pre conditions put by the unions that we don’t undertake disciplinary action against members seen to have undergone the illegal strike, we can not agree to that.” Related Video
