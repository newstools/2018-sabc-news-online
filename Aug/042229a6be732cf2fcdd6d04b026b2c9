A study conducted by the University of Cape Town’s Economics of Tobacco Control Project has found that Africa has become a prime target for tobacco companies. They now see the continent as a major destination for tobacco production and consumption. The study found that an increase in consumers in Africa who can now afford smoking, together with weak tobacco control laws, has resulted in the tobacco industry focusing its attention on increasing its market presence across the continent. UCT spokesperson, Aamirah Sonday, says the study also found that there were 62 cigarette production facilities in 30 African countries. “The study examined cigarette consumption in 22 countries which host 80% of the continent’s population and found that between 1990 and 2012, cigarette consumption increased from 165.6 billion to 238.5 billion cigarettes, or by 44%. The study calls for better data collection in Africa to support evidence-based policy that can respond more powerfully to the emerging tobacco epidemic in Africa,” said Sonday.
