The South African Weather Service says the extremely cold temperatures that many parts of the country are currently experiencing will pick up significantly in the next few days, especially in Limpopo, Mpumalanga and Gauteng. A cold front is also expected to hit the Western Cape on Sunday bringing with it isolated thundershowers. Forecaster Khumsa Masizana says the weather system which brought rainfall to the eastern parts of the country has exited. “We are expecting no rainfall for today, just some partly conditions over the southern part, still having a significant drop in the temperatures. Cold to cool temperatures throughout the country, but cold over the northern interior of the Eastern Cape today, there’s still some snow visible over the Drakensburg Mountain. For tomorrow we have an approaching cold-front which will make landfall tomorrow afternoon into the Western Cape.” Watch for more:
