President Cyril Ramaphosa has informed two senior National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) officials of his intention to institute inquiries into their fitness to hold office. He has given Deputy National Director of Public Prosecutions Advocate Nomgcobo Jiba and Special Director of Public Prosecutions Advocate Lawrence Mrwebi until next Friday to explain why they should not be suspended pending these inquiries. The two were struck off the roll in 2016 following several decisions they have made. These included dropping charges against suspended Police Crime Intelligence head, Richard Mdluli, the spy tapes matter relating to the scrapping of corruption charges against former President Jacob Zuma and the case of suspended KwaZulu-Natal Hawks head, Johan Booysen in the alleged Cato Manor death squad matter. Mrwebi and Jiba were reinstated to the roll of advocates in July after the Supreme Court of Appeal upheld their appeal against a 2016 ruling by the Pretoria High Court. The president’s decision to serve suspension notices on the two comes as the Constitutional Court is expected to rule on whether the appointment of Shawn Abrahams as NPA head was valid.
