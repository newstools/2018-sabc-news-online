Scores of ANC members in the Eastern Cape are attending the funeral of the former ambassador to Denmark, Stephens Gawe in the Peelton location near Bhisho. He died three weeks ago while visiting his daughter in the United Kingdom. Gawe is the son of the late Reverend Walker Gawe who was involved in the formation of the ANC. Gawe studied at Fort Hare but was arrested for political activities before he could finish his BA honours degree. ANC veteran Lungelo Dwaba says he hopes that young people will learn from Gaweâ€™s legacy.
