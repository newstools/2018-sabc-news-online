North West MEC for Public Safety and Transport, Mpho Motlhabane, has confirmed that former premier Supra Mahumapelo has returned the state’s vehicle last week Friday. Motlhabane also says that the protection services by state security personnel have been withdrawn. This is after opposition parties in the province last week, called for the immediate cancellation of the fringe benefits Mahumapelo was still enjoying. Mahumapelo resigned as North West premier in May following allegations of corruption that led to violent protests around the province. MEC Mpho Motlhabane says “After the review, the Minister then indicated that the security threats against him are no more there. Therefore the former premier released the car and took it back to the premier’s office and the department then assessed the car from the premier’s office and took it to the service provider to check any challenges in terms of road worthiness of the car”.
