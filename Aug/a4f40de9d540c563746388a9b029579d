Zimbabwe’s President, Emmerson Mnangagwa, has vowed to open a probe into the violence which followed the country’s July election. He was speaking after being sworn in at a stadium in the capital, Harare. Mnangagwa, whose inauguration comes after the disputed July election, says he will soon announce members of a commission of inquiry into the violence. Earlier, in his inaugural address to the nation as elected President, Mnangagwa called for unity among Zimbabweans.  “I took it upon myself to preach the message of peace, none violence, harmony and unity before, during and after elections. I wish to thank you fellow Zimbabwean for having heeded my call for peace until this day. We’re still enjoying this day. The isolated and unfortunate violence of 1st August was regrettable and most unacceptable. Such conduct should be alien to our nature, culture and traditions as the Zimbabwean people,” he said.
