The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) student command is enraged at the death of one of their members who was a student at Rhodes University. Third year BA student, Khensani Maseko is reported to have committed suicide over the weekend. Maseko allegedly battled depression after she was raped in May. The institution has confirmed that the student passed away at her Johannesburg family home. The funeral is set for Thursday in Johannesburg, coinciding with National Women’s Day. EFF student command president, Peter Keetse says women students have been decrying the rape culture at the university for several years. “Apparently she had wrote something that she was raped and she couldn’t handle it, and as a result she lost it and took her own life. We do have a delegation that we have put that side of the EC to speak to the university, not only about this incident but because knowing very well that there is this rape culture in that university. There are 4 women who were expelled for life because they were protesting against rapists, and the university took the side of the rapists and as a result they expelled those students for life.”
