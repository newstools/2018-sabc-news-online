Rhodes University in Makhanda in the Eastern Cape says the death of Khensani Maseko highlights the pervasive scourge of gender-based violence in society. Police confirmed that the third year Bachelor of Arts student committed suicide at her Meyersdal Ridge Estate home in the east of Johannesburg on Friday. It is believed she had been battling depression after she said she was raped in May at the university. The alleged perpetrator, who’s also a student at the University, was issued with a notice of suspension on Monday. Rhodes University Spokesperson Luzuko Jacobs says a number of activities are planned for Tuesday,      however the memorial service will be held at a date still to be announced after consulting with the Maseko family. “On Tuesday 7th August, a march to the settlers monument is planned. The monument is where the university traditionally holds its graduation ceremonies and where Khensani would have rounded off her journey through Rhodes University.  The issue of sexual consent will be discussed in a series of talks which will be open to everyone on campus.” Watch the video below for related news:
