United Nations chief Antonio Guterres has voiced deep sorrow on Saturday at the news of his predecessor Kofi Annan passing away, calling him “a guiding force for good”. Annan is said to have died on Saturday morning in Switzerland after a short illness aged 80.  “In many ways, Kofi Annan was the United Nations. He rose through the ranks to lead the organisation into the new millennium with matchless dignity and determination,” says Guterres. Annan was UN Secretary-General between 1997 to 2006. He was also a chair of the group of elders set up by former president, Nelson Mandela.
