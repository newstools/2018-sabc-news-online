Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo has instructed the State Capture Inquiry counsel to prepare papers to summon former Government Communication and Information System (GCIS) head Mzwanele Manyi to testify at the Commission. This comes after current witness acting CEO of GCIS Phuma Williams testified that she received a SMS from Manyi trying to influence her evidence. Williams says Manyi told her to say there were no New Age and SABC-breakfasts organised by the Guptas during his tenure at the GCIS. Williams is still testifying at the State Capture Inquiry. “I would ask the legal team to prepare documentation for me that would enable me to take a decision on this or authorise the taking of some action whether its summoning Manyi, documentation that will include the text message that was sent,” says Zondo.
