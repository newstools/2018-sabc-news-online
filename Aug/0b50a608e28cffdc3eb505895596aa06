The Hawks in the Northern Cape have denied that former ANC politician John Block and businessman Christo Scholtz are fugitives from justice but says they are looking for the two men. The national Hawks office is to comment on the Block matter later Friday morning. SABC news desk earlier carried a report saying that the men were fugitives from justice after failing to hand themselves over to authorities. However the Hawks say they are looking for the men and that the men are not fugitives from justice. Block and Scholtz had been sentenced to 15 years after being convicted of fraud and corruption among other things. They were supposed to hand themselves over to authorities on Thursday. The Supreme Court of Appeal dismissed their appeal against their conviction and sentences but granted the men leave to appeal to the Constitutional Court. Related Video
