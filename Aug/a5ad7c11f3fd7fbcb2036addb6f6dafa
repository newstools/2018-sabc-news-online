A number of South African political parties have reacted to the death of Kofi Annan.  They have joined the world in paying tribute to the late former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan. ANC secretary general, Ace Magashule, says Annan’s passions were silencing the guns on the African continent and delivering universal health coverage. “An eminent and distinguished son of Africa, Mr. Annan was a great friend of the people of South Africa who played an immeasurable role in shaping the global agenda in favour of the people of the developing South. As the 7th United Nations Secretary General from 1996 to 2006, Mr. Annan painstakingly utilised his tenure to advance peace and sustainable development, while working determinedly to push back the frontiers of poverty and underdevelopment.” EFF leader Julius Malema says Annan’s commitment to peace should continue to inspire future leaders. “We are particularly impressed that Kofi Annan demonstrated Black excellence when many doubted his capacity on the basis of his skin colour he was able to rise above that is why today in many countries where they had problems they always asked for Kofi Annan’s wisdom. May his soul rest in perfect peace.” IFP leader Dr Mangosuthu Buthelezi praised the former UN Chief Diplomat for placing Africa and its people at the forefront. And the DA Spokesperson Solly Malatsi has hailed him as a staunch Ambassador for Africa and a promoter of democracy around the world. Former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan has died in Switzerland Saturday morning. The 80-year old international diplomat is said to succumbed to a short illness. Annan was the UN Secretary-General between 1997 to 2006. He was also a chair of the group of elders set up by former President Nelson Mandela.
