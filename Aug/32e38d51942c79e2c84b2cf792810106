The case against ‘Broken Vows’ actor Sello Sebotsane is expected to resume at the Johannesburg Magistrate’s Court on Wednesday. Sebotsane is facing charges of domestic violence and assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm. This after his ex-wife, ‘Skeem Saam’ actress Shoki Mmola-Sebotsane, opened a domestic violence case against him. During his previous appearance, their 10 year old daughter testified in a special court with a facilitator and video live-streaming. The child was deemed to be too scared of her father to testify live. A new witness is on Wednesday expected to take to the stand.
