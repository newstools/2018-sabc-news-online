EFF leader Julius Malema says Kofi Annan’s committment to peace should continue to inspire future leaders. He says they are impressed that Annan demonstrated Black excellence when many doubted his capacity on the basis of his skin colour. He says: “He was able to rise above that. That is why many countries where they had problems they always asked for Kofi Annan’s wisdom. May his soul rest in perfect peace.” The 7th Secretary General and second African to lead the global organisation passed away after a short illness in Bern, Switzerland on Saturday. He was 80-years-old. It was the culmination of a career with the UN that saw him rise through the ranks since his appointment as a lowly budget officer at the World Health Organisation (WHO) in 1962. He served two terms as UN Chief receiving the Nobel Peace Prize along with the UN for their work for a better-organized and more peaceful world. Current UN chief Antonio Guterres described his predecessor as “a guiding force for good“. “In many ways, Kofi Annan was the United Nations,” he said. “He rose through the ranks to lead the organisation into the new millennium with matchless dignity and determination.” The UN said it would fly flags at half mast at all of its locations around the world through Tuesday. -Additional reporting by AFP
