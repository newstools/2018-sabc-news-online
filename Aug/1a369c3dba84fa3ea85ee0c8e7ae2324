A head-on collision between a SUV and light motor vehicle has left three people dead. Earlier KwaZulu-Natal Road Traffic Inspectorate spokesperson Zinhle Mngamezulu-Mali says both the north and south bound carriage ways have been partially closed off to traffic. “Both bounds are obstructed and we are diverting traffic around the scene of the accident. The cause of the accident is unknown at this stage and two counts of culpable homicide is being investigated. We urge motorists to practice caution in that area.” It’s believed that a vehicle had a flat tyre and was parked in the fast lane on the N2 northbound lane, when a family traveling in a light motor vehicle swerved to avoid the stationary vehicle, colliding with another vehicle. An international family traveling towards Durban, on their way back from a safari holiday, had a head-on collision with another light motor vehicle on the N2 near Zinkwazi. The driver of the light motor vehicle unfortunately died shortly after arrival of paramedics. A 12-year-old girl who was traveling in the SUV with her family was also declared dead on arrival of IPSS paramedics. The father, mother and older brother all sustained critical injuries and all three patients were airlifted to Lenmed Ethekweni hospital, with the assistance of IPSS/Black Eagle aeromedical helicopter and AMS. The driver of the SUV was still entrapped in the wreckage and required KDM fire department to use the jaws of life to free him, before he was transported by IPSS Medical Rescue ambulance to hospital. Unfortunately the mother succumbed to her injuries shortly after arrival at hospital. Foeta Krige
