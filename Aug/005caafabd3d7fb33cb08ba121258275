Political analyst Professor Tinyiko Maluleke says the Democratic Alliance and Solly Msimanga face an uphill battle in their campaign to win Gauteng outright in the 2019 elections. On Sunday the DA announced that current Tshwane mayor Msimanga was its Gauteng premier candidate for 2019. Party leader Mmusi Maimane says they have faith in Msimanga as he has achieved success in growing Tshwane and he would do the same in Gauteng. However, Maluleke says the policy problems that plague the party are likely to harm its campaign for Gauteng. “He has committed serious blunders; there was allegations of some company that were using Tshwane facilities without paying while billing the city.” “So he has made his mistakes and certainly that’s what the opposition is going to focus on. On the other side the DA still has a lot of work to do and that may complicate their aspirations for Gauteng. All of these things will certainly be brought up at Solly Msimanga campaigns.” Click video below:
