The office of DA leader, Mmusi Maimane has distanced the party from the latest tweet by Western Cape Premier, Helen Zille, in which she continues to defend the legacy of colonialism. Maimane’s spokesperson, Portia Adams says in writing that Zille is entitled to her own opinion, like anyone else in the country. In her latest tweet, Zille argues that if the legacy of colonialism is ONLY negative, then the Constitution, formal education institutions and the English language are among the things that should be scrapped. Adams says the DA’s position is that colonialism, like apartheid, was a crime against humanity and her party is working hard to bring opportunities to people who were denied chances under these oppressive systems.
