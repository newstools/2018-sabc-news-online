Shaun Abrahams is set to know his future as National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) chief on Monday when the Constitutional Court hands down judgment in this regard. In February 2018, the Constitutional Court reserved judgment on an application to confirm two declaratory orders that Abrahams’s appointment was invalid, made by the High Court in Pretoria the previous December. The High Court declared that former President Jacob Zuma had acted unconstitutionally by terminating Mxolisi Nxasana‘s appointment as the then National Director of Public Prosecutions and replacing him with Abrahams. The application was brought by two NGO’s – Corruption Watch and Freedom Under Law. Abrahams and the NPA are appealing against the order setting aside the appointment of Abrahams. Watch more below:
