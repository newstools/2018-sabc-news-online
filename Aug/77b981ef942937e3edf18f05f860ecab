The Freedom Front Plus (FF Plus) has laid criminal charges against African National Congress (ANC) Councillor Sephiri Lephoko, who reportedly encouraged community members on Sunday to illegally occupy land near the Meloding informal settlement at Virginia in the Free State. The FF Plus says nearly 1 000 people were apparently spurred on by his alleged statement to illegally occupy the farm Christiana. A fire was started on the farm and nearly 300 hectares of veld burnt before the fire was brought under control. The FF Plus says itâ€™s extremely irresponsible and unacceptable for a Councillor of a political party to encourage anyone to commit a crime.
