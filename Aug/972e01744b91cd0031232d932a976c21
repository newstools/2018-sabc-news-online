The Democratic Alliance (DA) in the Western Cape has commended the South African Police Service for making over 11 000 arrests in four months since the start of “Operation Thunder,” which was launched to combat crime in gang ridden areas in the province. More than 250 officers were brought in from across the country to bolster the operation. DA spokesperson for Community Safety in the Western Cape, Mark Wiley, says they are calling on national government to deploy more officers in the province. “About 11 000 people have been arrested. Numerous of them are gangster figures, high flyers so to speak and there was a lot of detail with regards to names and the offences and when the appearance dates are. So we were grateful for that and we really wish them well, hoping that they do get on top of this scourge that is terrorising communities in the Western Cape.”
