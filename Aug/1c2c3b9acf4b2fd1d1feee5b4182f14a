Former Wits University lecturer Professor Anton Harber is launching a legal bid to clear his name after late African National Congress (ANC) struggle icon Winnie Madikizela-Mandela named him and SABC Economics Editor, Thandeka Gqubule as part of Stratcom’s propaganda campaign. Haber and Gqubule were named in a documentary titled: Winnie. In response, the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) issued a statement lambasting the South African National Editors Forum (Sanef) for remaining silent on the matter. Harber says the EFF must retract its statements. “Our main purpose is to stop them [EFF] making this ridiculous, false and baseless accusation. The main purpose of what we’re doing is to ask a judge to rule on the facts, to find that there is no factual basis for the allegations being made and to insist that they remove it from their website.”
