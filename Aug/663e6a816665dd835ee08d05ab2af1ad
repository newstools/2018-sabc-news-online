Newly elected Mayor of the Nelson Mandela Bay Metro Mongameli Bobani has promised to accelerate service delivery. Bobani was unanimously elected during a vote of no confidence against mayor Athol Trollip in absentia, in a council meeting that was dominated by adjournments in Port Elizabeth. Earlier before the adjournment, Speaker Jonathan Lawack was ousted after one DA councillor, Mbulelo Manyathi abstained during the vote. DA councillors and its coalition partners, COPE and the ACDP, walked out of the meeting saying the sitting was illegal. Bobani says the new coalition will work as a collective. He says: “The former Mayor was just doing things alone without even the collective. This particular government is going to work as a collective government, we are going to include all our stakeholders. TheMayor is just going to be the spokesperson of this collective and this is how things must go. In this government, our interest is our people.” Meanwhile,  Trollip says clarity on his position needs to be sought soon. He and DA leader Mmusi Maimane will address the media in Cape Town on Tuesday.
