Western Cape Minister of Health Dr Nomafrench Mbombo has opened a new surgical ward and a CT scan suite at the Khayelitsha District Hospital on the Cape Flats. Six years after its opening, the hospital now serves a population of over 400-thousand people, with 95 % of the facility’s feeder area population dependent on public health care. The facility has 300 beds and currently operates at a 130 percent bed occupancy rate, as it provides both district and regional health care services. The new surgical ward has 30 beds. The CT scan suite is already in use and will operate at full capacity later this month, resulting in quicker diagnoses as patients will no longer have to be transferred to Tygerberg Hospital for CT scans.
