The Democratic Alliance (DA) says it wants to replace the idea of Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment (B-BBEE) with a policy of economic inclusion of those who were previously excluded by either their race or their gender. DA Member of Parliament, Gwen Ngwenya says the ANC’s model of BEE has failed. She says the DA’s goal is to advance the empowerment of disadvantaged South Africans, the majority of whom are black. “We want to increasingly move to a non-racial basis.” She says a World Bank report recently published on overcoming poverty and inequality in SA showed that race is becoming a declining factor in terms of determining inequality and other socioeconomic characteristics such as education and skills are actually far more important in determining inequality.” “So a policy based on disadvantage will have predominantly black beneficiaries. This is absolutely a policy about empowering black South Africans and is a choice between alternatives. BEE is but one way of empowerment and there is a plethora of options out there and we are saying that it is about time we explore them, says Ngwenya.  ANC slams the DA The ANC has slammed the DA for what it calls the opposition party’s ‘flip flopping’ on BBBEE. The ANC’s national spokesperson, Pule Mabe, says that black economic empowerment is a crucial instrument for redressing past economic injustices. “When you introduce a policy like BBBEE you are trying to redress the past imbalances and also resolve the triple challenges which are unemployment, poverty and inequalities to create an equal society where opportunities are distributed equally. “We had to take care of those who had suffered on being sidelined, such as women, people with disabilities and young people. Our people are also given space to participate in the productive sectors of the economy and not just through government supply chain.”
