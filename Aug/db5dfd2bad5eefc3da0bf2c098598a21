The City of Johannesburg says it has been informed that the labour unrest taking place at the Driving Licensing Card Account (DLCA) may have affected applications for driving licenses. This has led to delays in the issuing of card type driving licenses. The DLCA employees, who have refused to renew their contracts, are demanding permanent employment from the department. To deal with the problem, City of Johannesburg Licensing Centres will issue temporary licenses to new as well as renewing driving license applicants. Member of the Mayoral Committee for Public Safety Michael Sun says, “We don’t know when this issue will be resolved. But however, as an interim measure the City of Johannesburg Licensing Centres will be issuing temporary licenses to new as well as renewing driving license applicants. These temporary licenses will be valid for 6 months and if the issue is not resolved then obviously the applicants can renew the temporary licenses again.”
