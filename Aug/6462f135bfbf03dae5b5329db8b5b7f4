Employees at Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital in Soweto have embarked on early morning and lunch hour protests since Monday. They’re calling on the hospital CEO to step down over allegations of corruption, maladministration and nepotism. Those involved include members affiliated to National Health Education & Allied Workers Union (Nehawu), Democratic Nursing Organisation of South Africa (Denosa), Health & Other Services Personnel Trade Union of South Africa (Hospersa) and the Public Servants Association (PSA). “We want to send a message to the department and say, you cannot investigate a person who is within the institution. The last time we engaged the department they said to us they cannot deal with the CEO anyhow. There’s a senior management handbook and they have to observe those processes. We agree but he cannot report on duty while you are conducting the investigation,” says spokesperson, Yandiswa Zongula. Watch related video below
