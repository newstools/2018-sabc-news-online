The rain has been falling over a large part of the drought-stricken Eastern Cape since the early hours of Friday morning. It’s not nearly enough to make a major impact on the dams. Farmers in the citrus area of Patensie and Joubertina but residents have welcomed the more than 30 millimetres that has already fallen. The Kouga dam near Patensie is only at 7% of capacity. Only half of Friday’s 45 millimetres of rain fell over the main catchment areas. However, Joubertina, a major citrus export area reported a good 45 millimetres by mid-afternoon. The downpours are a relief for Hankey and Patensie residents where stringent water restrictions are in place. In Port Elizabeth the Baakens River is flowing for the first time in two years. Between 30-48 millimetres was reported across the city. Roads over low lying bridges are closed. Heavy rain also fell in East London causing wide spread flooding in low lying areas. More heavy rain has been predicted for the province overnight. Snow is also falling along high lying areas.
