The SARS inquiry is in its 11th round of public hearings since it started earlier this year. It has emerged that Bain, the consulting agency responsible for introducing the restructuring project at SARS, followed an irregular tender process which saw it paid R164-million for what was initially a R2-million tender. During the bidding processes, Bain initially offered SARS a 50% discount on the tender which saw them securing it for R2-million. However, on receiving the work Bain continued to charge double rates for the rest of the project, bringing their final bill to R164-million.
