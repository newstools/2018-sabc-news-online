Convicted African National Congress (ANC) politician, John Block and businessman Christo Scholtz are now fugitives from justice. The Hawks in the Northern Cape have confirmed that they are looking for both men after they failed to report to a correctional services facility to start their 15 year sentence. On Tuesday the Supreme Court of Appeal in Bloemfontein dismissed the appeal by former ANC chairperson Block and Trifecta Investments CEO Scholtz. The two were challenging the conviction and 15year sentence imposed on them by the Kimberley High Court. They had been found guilty of fraud and corruption among other things. Hawks spokesperson, Nomthando Mnisi says the search for the two has started. “Concerning John Block he was supposed to appear today at 10:00am but he never made any appearance so the Hawks are still looking for his whereabouts even Scholtz is nowhere to be found.” WATCH RELATED VIDEO:
