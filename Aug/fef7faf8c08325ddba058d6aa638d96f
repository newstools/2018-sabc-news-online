South Africa has urged the private sector to play a greater role in the development of SADC countries. President Cyril Ramaphosa has handed over the one-year rotational chairpersonship of the regional block to his Namibian counterpart Hage Geingob at the Heads of State Summit in the Namibian capital, Windhoek. Ramaphosa says under South Africa’s leadership SADC has been able to secure more than 500 million dollars of committed productive investments by South African companies across the region. But he says the private sector in all member states needs to play a part in the developmental agenda of the region. “The private sector should play a leading role in creating jobs, driving trade and industrialisation and fostering regional integration. We, therefore, need to ensure that we create an environment for business to thrive.” “The ability of SADC countries to establish a competitive industrial sector and promote greater industrial linkages has been hindered by the lack of infrastructure in areas such as energy, transport and communications. Investment in infrastructure must therefore be a central priority for our region.” Click video below:
