Members of the Energy Committee in Parliament were united in condemning Energy Minister Jeff Radebe and his Department for failure to brief the committee about the increase in fuel prices. Neither the ministry nor the department turned up at a scheduled briefing. The minister is however said to be out of the country. Democratic Alliance (DA) member of the Energy Committee Gavin Davis says the increase in fuel prices is a serious matter, condemning Radebe’s non-attendance. “Minister Radebe has been promising to communicate on this issue since the beginning of July and in fact, we thought that he was going to communicate by the second week of July. We have heard nothing from him. After every cabinet meeting, Minister Mokonyane said Minister Radebe will communicate on the fuel prices, and today was the perfect opportunity. I mean this was the opportunity to communicate to the nation that the government has a plan to keep the fuel price down.” Meanwhile, ANC member of the committee Zukiswa Faku shared Davis’ sentiments in criticising Radebe’s conduct. “This is really unacceptable and undermining of the committee.  It’s not the first time that the meeting is postponed because of the non-availability of the minister. I think before we went to recess, two committees didn’t sit because of the non-availability of the minister. This one is worse now because even the officials are nowhere to be found. I concur with honourable Davis, it’s unacceptable and disrespectful.” Watch: More on 2018 fuel price hikes:
