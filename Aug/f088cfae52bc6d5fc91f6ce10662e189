The African National Congress (ANC) has removed former North West Premier Supra Mahumapelo as party chairperson in the province. The ANC has also disbanded its North West Provincial Executive Committee (PEC) and Job Mokgoro has been appointed as convener. Mahumapelo previously cautioned the party’s highest decision body, the National Executive Committee, that disbanding his Provincial Executive Committee, may cost the party in the province. The party’s National Working Committee, led by President Cyril Ramaphosa, came to the province last week to consult with all branches, regards the state of the party. He was accompanied by General-Secretary, Ace Magashule, Deputy President David Mabuza and National Chair Gwede Mantashe . Although at the Ruth Mompati region, in Vryburg, the consultative meeting was forced to be cancelled after an unruly crowd disrupted proceedings.
