The South African Communist Party in the North West is calling on government to revoke the licences of mining companies that retrench their workers. The party’s call follows the announcement of Impala Platinum mine in Rustenburg after it’s notice to retrench more than 13 000 workers over the next two years. “In the amendments of the mining charter we are going to argue that there must be a clause that allows a minister to take away a mining licence when a mine is destroying both the economy and the employment of the country- and that the mining licence must be taken out and be auctioned in public.” says SACP provincial secretary, Madoda Sambatha.
