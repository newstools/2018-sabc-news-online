Chancellor at the Mangosuthu University of Technology (MUT), Lindiwe Sisulu says they will call for a life sentence for individuals who murder women. She was speaking at the unveiling of the memorial fountain to honour the late university student, Zolile Khumalo. Sisulu says 15 years is not enough. Twenty-one-year-old Khumalo was shot and killed allegedly by her former boyfriend in her room on her off-campus residence in May 2008. The fountain symbolises the university’s commitment to the safety of students and its condemnation of gender-based violence. Lindiwe Sisulu says:”We would like to propose a law through Parliament in which anybody who kills a woman will get a life sentence. That means the duration of their life, not just the fifteen years statutorily regarded as a life sentence because this is the most heinous crime ever committed.” Click video below:
