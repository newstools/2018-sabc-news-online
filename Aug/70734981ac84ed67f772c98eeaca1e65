The South African National Defense Force (SANDF) is calling on local communities to assist them with information that could lead to the arrest of criminals conducting illegal operations on the South African border. On Tuesday police and members of the SANDF recovered a stolen 4Ã—4 vehicle on the Mozambican and South African border. They believe that car hijacking syndicates are continuing to work with local community members. The SANDF says it is because the community has first hand knowledge of the local terrain. Between March this year and August so far, stolen vehicles worth over R7 million have been recovered on the Mozambique border.
