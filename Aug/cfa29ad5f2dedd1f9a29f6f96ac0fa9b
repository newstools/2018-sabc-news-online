Academic activities have resumed at the University of Venda after student protests that started four weeks ago. Students were demanding NSFAS allowances to cover the cost of food, off-campus living and transport fees. Students have mixed feelings about the end of the boycott. One student says: “I feel good and I feel great because we are back in classes and most of the students received their allowances.” Another student had this to say: “I can not say I feel good because as a poor black student I depend on my allowance and I haven’t received it but other students have already received theirs.” Related video
