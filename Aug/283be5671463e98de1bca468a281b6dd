The memorial service of Katlego Monareng, the Tshwane University of Technology’s (TUT) student who was shot dead during a protest is underway at the south campus in Soshanguve, north of Pretoria. Pan Africanist Congress of Azania’s president Narius Moloto, TUT management, including principal Lourens van Staden, various student formations and students are in attendance. Various speakers have called on law enforcement to ensure the person responsible for Monareng’s death is brought to book. He was shot dead last week when police intervened during a protest after students displayed their unhappiness regarding the SRC elections process. Those in attendance are singing and dancing to pay tribute to one of theirs.
