The police insist that they have nothing to do with the fatal shooting of a student at the Tshwane University of Technology’s (TUT) Soshanguve Campus. This after violence erupted among students during the election of a new students’ representative council Thursday night. Gauteng police are investigating a case of murder after one person was shot dead.   TUT’s spokesperson Willa de Ruyter says a police probe is expected to shed more light on what happened. “There’s police investigation underway to determine exactly what happened and who was responsible. It not clear where the shooting took place. We have suspended activities at both north and south campuses and we are monitoring the situation very closely.” Earlier, the EFF Student Command has condemned what it calls “police brutality” that led to the death of one student and scores others being injured. Six students were arrested and two vehicles torched as violence flared up last night. It’s alleged that police fired shots at students who were protesting over alleged rigging of SRC elections. The EFF Student Command’s Sakhile Khoza says those responsible for the death of the student, who belonged to the PAC student wing PASMA, must be brought to book. “So the way forward is that we are closing this campus until management have something to give us and on the way forward on what must happen. Because we lost our brother, our fellow student. This issue is affecting all of us and we do support PASMA on their loss. So we are fighting for our students.”
