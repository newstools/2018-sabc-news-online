South Africans have until Wednesday to make submissions on the Climate Bill.  The bill is aimed at helping South Africa budget better to mitigate the effect of climate change. According to University of Witwatersrand carbon budget is the amount of carbon dioxide the people of the world can collectively emit while limiting the global temperature rise to 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. The budget focuses on how people are polluting and how pollution should be cut down by 2050. The World Health Organisation (WHO) predicts that between 2030 and 2050, climate change is expected to cause approximately 250 000 additional deaths per year, from malnutrition, malaria, diarrhoea and heat stress. Governments in the world agree that temperatures must not rise by more than two degrees Celsius to preserve life as it is now. Temperatures in South Africa are getting warmer and currently the country’s interior warmth is at twice the global rate. Click below for more on the story:
