The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) has announced that it will table a motion of no confidence in Tshwane Mayor Solly Msimanga following claims of corruption. This comes on the back of a motion which has been filed by the African National Congress (ANC) in Tshwane, for what the party claims was Msimanga’s role in tender irregularities by City Manager Moeketsi Mosola. Mosola is being accused of flouting the city’s supply chain management policy after the awarding of a tender to an engineering company called GladAfrica. The company was tasked with assisting city departments in rolling out their capital infrastructure programmes valued at R3.7 billion. Msimanga has since rejected the claims. “We are not going to support any motion of no confidence against Solly, we have put the motion of no confidence ourselves so we can’t support ourselves. So we have put the motion of no confidence against Solly, and we hope that other political parties including the DA will support us. We are not going to support any party; we are going to support any credible candidate. If the ANC has any credible candidate let them put a candidate forward, if the DA has got another credible candidate who is not Solly Msimanga, who is not scared of the white caucus, they can put that person forward. We will support that person and we are not going to have a meeting with anyone,” says EFF leader Julius Malema. Author-Mbali Thethani WATCH RELATED VIDEO:
