Police are on high alert in Soweto where 27 people have now been arrested following Wednesday’s clashes between residents and foreign shop owners. There was widespread looting and damage to property, leaving at least two people dead and another critically wounded. The City of Johannesburg has condemned the violence. Johannesburg MMC for Public Safety Michael Sun visited the embattled White City area in Soweto on Wednesday night “I’ve seen shops mainly owned by foreigners being completed looted. The situation is volatile and whilst I was standing at the scene of the incident several gunshots went off. We just wanted to urge residents to please be vigilant in the area. We suspect that violence may continue. JMPD and SAPS are on high alert. I’ve requested police officers to intensify their efforts to ensure the situation is brought to a manageable level,” says Sun.
