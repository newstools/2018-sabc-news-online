Convicted racist and former real estate agent Vicki Momberg has been granted R2000 bail in the Randburg Magistrateâ€™s Court. This comes after the High Court in Johannesburg granted her leave to appeal her conviction and three-year jail term on Monday. She was found guilty of using the k-word at least 48 times against black police officers who tried to assist her following a smash and grab incident in Northriding, Johannesburg, two years ago. Momberg has been in jail since March. She will now be out on bail while waiting the outcome of her appeal. She was found guilty by the Randburg Magistrates Court in March this year and sentenced to an effective two years in jail. The court also rejected her application for leave to appeal her sentence and conviction.
