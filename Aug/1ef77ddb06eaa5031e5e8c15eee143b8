The Association of Mine-workers and Construction Union has strongly condemned the planned retrenchments at Impala Platinum mine in Rustenburg in the North West. Speaking to the media in Johannesburg,  Amcu President Joseph Mathunjwa says the platinum sector has already lost 7 800 jobs to date. The union has called on government to intervene to save jobs in the mining sector. Mathunjwa says they have approached Minerals and Resources Minister Gwede Mantashe but have not received any response regarding the matter. Impala is the world’s second biggest miner and employs more than 30 000 workers. It retrenched over 2 000 employees last year. Watch related video:
