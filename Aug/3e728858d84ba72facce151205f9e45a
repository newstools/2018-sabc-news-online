The Pan African Women’s Organisation (Pawo) says Zondeni Veronica Sobukwe led a life of consistency and commitment. Pawo member Ashantewaa Ngidi was speaking on the side-lines of Mama Sobukwe’s funeral underway at the Sobukwe Methodist Church in Graaff-Reinet, Eastern Cape. Sobukwe, who died last week at the age of 91, was the widow of the late PAC founder Robert Mangaliso Sobukwe. Ngidi says Mama Sobukwe has left big footsteps that need to be followed. “She has given us enough precedence on how we can live without being awarded, tagged or given positions. That is what we are here to celebrate today; a life of consistency and commitment without fanfare. But today women salute Mama because she has given us some big footsteps that we will walk courageously in.” Meanwhile, PAC members say they’re happy to have had an opportunity to know Mama Sobukwe as a lot of the values she instilled will be passed on to the next generation party. Members of the organisation continue to sing liberation songs about her life her funeral service. Watch the video below for more:
