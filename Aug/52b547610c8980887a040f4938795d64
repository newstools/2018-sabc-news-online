Zimbabwe’s President Emmerson Mnangagwa has confirmed that his ousted predecessor Robert Mugabe sent a letter of apology for not attending his inauguration at the National Sports stadium in the capital Harare on Sunday. Mugabe’s daughter, Bona and her husband Simba Chikore, were however among the VIPs who attended Mnangagwa’s inauguration. Mnangagwa began his acceptance speech during his inauguration by reading the content of Mugabe’s letter. The content read as such: “His Excellency, Cde ED Mnangagwa, President of the Republic of Zimbabwe. Your Excellency, thank you for your invitation to me and my wife to attend the inauguration ceremony.” “My wife is not well in Singapore and also I am not well so I am sending my daughter and her husband to represent us. Hearty congratulations.” WATCH THE INAUGURATION BELOW:
