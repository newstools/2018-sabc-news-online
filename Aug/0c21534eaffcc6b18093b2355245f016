Former Deputy Finance Minister Mcebisi Jonas is expected to be the next witness at the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture when it reconvenes on Friday. Jonas said some months ago that he had been offered the position of finance minister along with a considerable payment by Ajay Gupta. The inquiry will adjourn for two days. On Tuesday, National Treasury official, Willie Mathebula, was testifying on procurement processes. Mathebula earlier painted a grim picture of the abuse of procurement processes by some government departments.
