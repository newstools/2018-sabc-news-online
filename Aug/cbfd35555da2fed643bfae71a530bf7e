Finance Minister Nhlanhla Nene is on Wednesday expected to take the stand at the SARS Commission of Inquiry in Pretoria. The commission, which enters its second week of public hearings, is probing governance and administrative issues during suspended SARS Commissioner Tom Moyane’s tenure at the revenue service, from 2014 to 2018. This week the inquiry will hear testimonies from five witnesses. National Treasury official, Ismail Momonait is the first witness expected to give oral submission to the commission chaired by retired judge Robert Nugent. Other witnesses include Finance Minister Nhlanhla Nene, Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba, Judge Dennis Davis and consulting agency Bain. Bain is responsible for introducing the new operating model during Moyane’s tenure at the revenue service. The model has largely been criticised by tax professionals appearing before the commission, who described it as regressive and unnecessary.
