Amplifying and multiplying Winnie Madikizela-Mandela’s feminist legacy is the theme of the Soul City Institute for Social Justice’s talk to mark Women’s month. The event was held at the women’s jail at Constitutional Hill in Johannesburg. Lebo Ramafoko Ceo of Soul City says: “Winnie was very defiant and did not adhere to patriarchy. It’s sad that black men did not support her.” There’s no denying that Madikizela-Mandela had a striking presence. The younger generation has been urged to take note of how she appeared in public. Gail Smith a feminist writer and journalist says: “She commanded respect just by what she wore. Mostly the traditional attire because she knew that men only listen to men and they only listen to women if they look the part.” The talk seems to have struck a chord with young women. They say Madikizela-Mandela has inspired them to be advocates for women’s rights. The official women’s day celebration takes place in Cape Town on Thursday.
