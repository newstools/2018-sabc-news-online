Environmental activists from Greenpeace have scaled the Mandela Bridge in Braamfontein, Johannesburg. They are protesting against the inclusion of coal-fired energy in government’s latest draft Integrated Resource Plan. Greenpeace says the use of coal will lead to air pollution and will have a detrimental effect on the health of South Africans. Four Greenpeace activists scaled the bridge. They are expected to drop down a banner which asks government to take a stand against coal. They have also placed placards across the Mandela Bridge which says “Coal Kills”. They have also threatened to take government to court if it does not prioritize the safety of citizens. Traffic has not been disrupted.
