Academic activities have been halted at another tertiary institution in Limpopo. Students at the University of Limpopo in Turfloop are boycotting lectures over a number of issues including meal allowances and in-sourcing of university staff. Students at the University of Venda in Thohoyandou are protesting over similar matters. The universityâ€™s main entrance is blockaded with rocks. Students have abandoned classes and are confined to their residences. As a safety measure, university management and staff have not reported to work. Students did not want to be interviewed on camera, but say they want university workers on short term contracts to be made permanent. They also want to withdraw cash with their National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NFSAS) cards. University management was not available for comments. Meanwhile, the student protest at the University of Venda has entered its second week. Most students have left the campus.
