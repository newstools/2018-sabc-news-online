Higher Education Minister Naledi Pandor will appoint an administrator to oversee the management of the National Student Financial Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS). This emerged after Friday’s special meeting between Pandor and the NSFAS board in Pretoria. NSFAS was rocked by the resignation of its chairperson Sizwe Nxasana this week. Pandor says the board fully supports her decision to appoint an administrator. “The board has elected a chairperson who I have confirmed appointment of, Prof Neil Garrod, who’s a Deputy Vice Chancellor at Central University of Technology. I also informed the board that I intend to appoint an administrator to oversee the management and administration of NSFAS.” Click video below:
