Outgoing Cape Town Mayor, Patricia De Lille, says she resigned as Mayor because she could no longer take the constant abuse. De Lille has rejected reports that internal DA proceedings were dropped as part of a settlement to step down as Mayor in a joint media briefing on Sunday with party leader Mmusi Maimane. De Lille resigned as Mayor with effect from 31 October. On Twitter, De Lille further wrote that the charges were withdrawn because of a lack of evidence and not as part of any supposed deal.   De Lille has been mayor of Cape Town since 2011. A process to elect a new mayor for the City of Cape Town will start immediately. Speaking of her future plan, De Lille says: “Now that the charges have been dropped and have been withdrawn, I can now go on with my life investing additional time, focusing on the real reason why I accepted the position as Mayor in the first place. It was to built a better city, a better country and an alternative to the ANC and to make sure that we save our country.”
