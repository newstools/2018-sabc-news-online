The African National Congress (ANC) caucus in the Nelson Mandela Bay Metro says it will report Mayor Athol Trollip to the Public Protector’s office over allegations of maladministration and corruption. Briefing the media in Port Elizabeth, the party says it will submit a dossier of allegations against Trollip, some dating back to 2016, to the Public Protector. The ANC’s allegations against Trollip relate to his disclosure of information meant for the council to Democratic Alliance (DA) leader Mmusi Maimane, as well as charges he laid against former Executive Director Linda Mti and the removal of Mongameli Bobani as deputy mayor. ANC Councillor Rory Riordan elaborates: “It is thus clear, in a matter of massive importance to council, the proposed removal of the Deputy Executive Mayor councillor Trollip untruthfully misled the leaders of three political parties in council in order to obtain their support for the removal of the then Deputy Executive Mayor, which then happened. Those are the five events which we believe are worth the Public Protector doing thorough investigation. We look forward to the Public Protector in our lives we hope she will send top class staff and get to the bottom of these matters.” DA Leader in the province Nqaba Bhanga says the allegations levelled against Trollip are baseless. “If they were so smart, they should have taken these matters to council for discussion and they can see there is nothing tangible that they can accuse Mr Trollip of. But we have a very childish leadership of the ANC that has not learnt how to be a good opposition…” Watch the video below for related news:
