Zimbabwe’s Constitutional Court is expected to make a ruling on the opposition party’s challenge, to the results of last month’s historic presidential election. Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) leader Nelson Chamisa is challenging President Emmerson Mnangagwa’s victory in the July 30 polls. Chamisa alleges that last month’s vote was rigged after the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC) declared Mnangagwa a winner. The state broadcaster has for the first time broadcast live court proceedings, with millions of people expected to tune in. The case has been cast as a major test of the independence of the highest court, whose verdict cannot be appealed. The court could throw the case out, declare a new winner or order a fresh election within 60 days. The verdict will also pave a way for Mnangagwa’s inaguration if the ruling ZANU PF wins the case.
