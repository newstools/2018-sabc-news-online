The African National Congress(ANC) says its newly-launched membership system will go a long way in addressing administrative challenges such as membership fraud and gatekeeping. The new system will see branch secretaries using scanning devices to document new party membership applications and also to register delegates during meetings. All the documented information will be monitored from the Secretary General’s office for record purposes. The party has been dragged in an out of court on numerous occasions over claims of membership manipulation and fraud. ANC Secretary-General Ace Magashule says the party has appointed service providers to implement this membership management system solution. He says: “The first phase will be linked to the ANC list process. From the beginning of September through to October this year, all ANC branches will have Branch General Meeting’s where ANC members in good standing will nominate ANC candidates for national and provincial legislatures.”
