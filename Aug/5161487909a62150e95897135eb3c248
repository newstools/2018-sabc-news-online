Taxi fares are going up across the country with effect from Wednesday. Taxi operators say the constant fuel price increases have prompted taxi associations to adjust their fares. This comes as the retail price of petrol in the main land went up by one cent a litre with effect from Wednesday. The Energy Department says illuminating paraffin will cost four cents more. LP Gas users are the hardest hit with a 17 cents price increase. However, the price of diesel has decreased by four cents a litre. National Taxi Alliance Spokesperson Theo Malele has urged taxi operators to be lenient in their fare adjustments. “Not all taxi associations have adjusted their prices. But those that would be adjusting their prices would do so according to the burden that they feel as operators on the ground. We have however cautioned our members not to be very exorbitant in the determining the prices.”
