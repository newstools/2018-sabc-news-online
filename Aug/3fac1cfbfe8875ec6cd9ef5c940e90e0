Democratic Alliance leader Mmusi Maimane has announced Solly Msimanga as the Gauteng Premier candidate in next year’s general elections. He says the 38 year old Tshwane mayor not only knows the plight of the poor, but he would also be able to bring in investor confidence. Maimane has described Msimanga as charismatic, articulate and possesses skills needed in Gauteng. He says he will help fight corruption, create more jobs and accelerate service delivery in Gauteng. Maimane says through Msimanga’s leadership, Tshwane has been ranked the fastest growing city in Africa, and he is confident he can do the same for the entire province. “We believe that the election in Gauteng has always been a battleground, and if we want to see a change in South Africa, it starts here in Gauteng. It’s been under Solly’s leadership in Tshwane that when he inherited a R2 billion debt from the previous ANC corrupt administration, and now he has grown it to a R704 million surplus. Just last month, Tshwane was ranked the fastest growing city in Africa, with almost R5 billion in investment already attracted to our country’s capital.” Msimanga has been a Democratic Alliance (DA) member for 14 years. Nine candidates applied for the position with the most prominent among them being Msimanga, Gauteng MPLs Makashule Gana and Ghaleb Cachalia and national spokesperson Refiloe Nt’sheke. The party is looking to win the country’s economic heartland outright in next year’s provincial and national elections.
