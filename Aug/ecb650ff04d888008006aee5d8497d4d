Democratic Alliance (DA)  leader, Mmusi Maimane, has called on President Cyril Ramaphosa to involve Parliament in the selection of the next national director of Public Prosecutions. He says while Ramaphosa is not compelled to do so, it will be the right thing to do to restore the credibility of the prosecution authority. Maimane was speaking after Monday’s Constitutional Court ruling that found the appointment of Shaun Abrahams’ as National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) head unconstitutional and invalid. The court has also given Ramaphosa 90 days to appoint a new head of the NPA. Maimane says the process to appoint a new NDPP must be transparent. “I want to urge Mr Ramaphosa to say let us bring the names of all the candidates to parliament to ensure transparency and accountability, let’s allow parliament to be engaged, so that when it’s done, the President who’s not compelled to do this process, but it will be right for Mr Ramaphosa to demonstrate the difference between the last administration and this one of his. Our interest in the matter is that there must be transparency in the appointment.” WATCH RELATED VIDEOS BELOW:
