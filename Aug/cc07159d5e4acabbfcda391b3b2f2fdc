Chairperson of the State Capture Inquiry Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo has directed commission officials to ensure that former African National Congress (ANC) Member of Parliament Vytjie Mentor, who testified on Tuesday, has safe accommodation. Mentor, who lives in Cape Town, is being accommodated in a Johannesburg hotel during her testimony. Justice Zondo was reacting after Mentor complained that the locks of her hotel room had been tampered with. Justice Raymond Zondo has requested the commission’s legal team to try and see what can be done, to ensure that Mentor is in a safe and comfortable environment. During the testimony, Mentor accused the Hawks’ Mandla Mtholo of interfering with her statement, in which she complained that former President Jacob Zuma had a corrupt relationship with his son, and the Gupta brothers. She said she submitted a hand-written statement and handed it to the police, but Mtholo then told her the statement would not go ahead if she did not remove then President Zuma’s name from it. Mentor concluded her testimony Tuesday afternoon. Author- Mbali Thethani
