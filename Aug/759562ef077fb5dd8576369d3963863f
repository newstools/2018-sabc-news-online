The public hearings into tax administration and governance at the South African Revenue Service will resume in Pretoria on Tuesday. The hearings relate to how suspended SARS Commissioner Tom Moyane managed the Revenue Service. The second session of the SARS inquiry will run until Friday. The session of the SARS Inquiry will open with testimonies from three witnesses on the first day. The hearing follows a ruling to dismiss all of the objections made by Moyane. Moyane wants both the SARS Inquiry and the disciplinary inquiry against him to be suspended. He had argued that the two processes overlapped, and formed an unfair double attack on him. At the time, the SARS commission chair, retired judge Robert Nugent said the inquiry was established by proclamation under the hand of the president and did not have the power to dissolve itself. President Cyril Ramaphosa established the inquiry into SARS in an effort to stabilise and restore confidence in the revenue collector. Related video click below:
