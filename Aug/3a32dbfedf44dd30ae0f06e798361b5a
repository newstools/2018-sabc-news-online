The Pan African Congress, under the leadership of Narius Moloto, has applied for a court interdict against the PAC Unity Conference to be held in Kimberley in the Northern Cape. The PAC has been plagued by internal squabbles and leadership challenges. Dr Motsoko Pheko served as the PAC’s deputy-president under Clarence Makwetu and Stanley Mokgoba. He was later to become the party’s President under Pheko’s leadership, Themba Godi then Deputy President was suspended ahead of the party congress. Not long afterwards, Pheko was also expelled for alleged misappropriation of the party’s funds. Letlapa Mphahlele was appointed party leader at a PAC congress held in Qwaqwa in the Free State. He too was expelled.  Alton Mphethi, who was acting in his place, was appointed the new PAC leader. Luthando Mbinda came into the picture and was appointed President after Mphahlele’s expulsion. Later Narius Moloto emerged as the new President at the time Luthando Mbinda was said to be elected the party’s president. But who is the President of the PAC? Now an interdict against the party’s unity conference, Moloto’s faction wants to prevent it from taking place. Click video below:
