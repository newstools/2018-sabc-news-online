Colder weather is hitting most of the country on Wednesday, with widespread snow falling on mountains in the south-west of the country. Inland provinces can expect icy winds and isolated rain, with temperatures in the Mpumalanga Lowveld have plummeted from a summer-like 30 degrees to 19 degrees. In the Western Cape, snow has been reported on the Matroosberge near Ceres, the Brandwacht mountain near Worcester, the Winterhoek mountains near Tulbagh, the Swartberg near De Rust and Oudsthoorn, as well as the Outeniqua range near George. Snow is expected further east this week. South African weather services forecaster Lulama Pheme says, “The cold conditions were in the Western Cape but now but now they are expected to be over the eastern and the north eastern parts of the country because in those areas behind the cold front that has moved east of the country there is a high that is extending a rage. And it is causing cloudy conditions for KwaZulu-Natal, as well as Limpopo and Mpumalanga escarpment and the low veld areas, and the temperatures are dropping significantly from what they were.”
