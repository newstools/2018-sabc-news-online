Four provinces will next week host memorial services for the late struggle stalwart, Zondeni Sobukwe. She died this week at her Graaff-Reinet home in the Eastern Cape aged 91. The Pan Africanist Congress of Azania says memorial services will be held at the University of Johannesburg, the Parliament Precinct in Cape Town, Robert Sobukwe town hall in Graaff Reinet and Fort Hare University in East London on Wednesday. The University of Limpopo will also hold one on Thursday. On Thursday the Presidency granted a Special Official funeral Category 2 for Mama Sobukwe on Saturday 25th in Graaff-Reinet. Itâ€™s reserved for distinguished persons designated by the president on request by the premier of a province. The national flag will fly at half-mast at every station in the country until the evening of the funeral service. Watch for more:
