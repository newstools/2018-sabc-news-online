South African Advocate Dali Mpofu will lead a legal team to challenge the Zimbabwe elections outcome on behalf of the opposition MDC Alliance leader, Nelson Chamisa. Mpofu confirmed to SABC News that his team will include renowned Advocate Tembeka Ngcukaitobi. The case is expected to be filed on Friday ahead of the seven-day deadline stipulated by the Electoral Act of Zimbabwe, and the planned inauguration of President elect Emmerson Mnangwagwa on Sunday. This is after MDC vowed to overturn in court for President Mnangagwa’s narrow election victory, alleging that he won the historic vote via “mammoth theft and fraud”. Chamisa says the party does not accept the Zimbabwe election results and will pursue all legal means to challenge Zanu-PF’s National Assembly and Presidential wins. Zanu-PF won close to 70% of seats in the National Assembly. The MDC Alliance says the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC) went out of its way to ensure that the ruling Zanu-PF wins elections. Meanwhile, Zimbabwean opposition personality Tendai Biti has been released on $5 000 bail in Harare after Zambia denied him asylum and deported him. Zimbabwean police have charged him with unofficial or false declaration of election results as well as inciting violence. He’s been ordered to hand over the title deed of his house.
