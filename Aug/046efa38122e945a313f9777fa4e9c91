The Western Cape government says it has been informed by concerned taxi operators and the police’s intelligence division that a minibus taxi industry task team involved in a legal dispute with the National Taxi Council has again threatened to withdraw the services of minibus taxis from Monday. The Western Cape Ministry of Transport says this is the same group that organised a violent taxi strike last year. Transport Ministry Spokesperson Donald Grant says they will continue to mediate. “These issues range from the impact on the industry caused by petrol price increases, issues of law enforcement not being enough to curb route invasions that’s happening. They’ve labelled various issues, other issues relating to the present elective conference and their preference to have a preference elective conference as opposed to an Indaba and then issues pertaining to certain members that have been suspended from the Santaco grouping. “ Click below for more on Western Cape taxi industry:
