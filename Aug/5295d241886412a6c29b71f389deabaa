Northern Cape Premier Sylvia Lucas has come under fire from her own party members. The ANC Women’s League in the Northern Cape has lambasted the premier for her silence during recent violent protests in Kimberley. The league marched to Lucas’s office with a memorandum of demands but the Premier wasn’t there. The city was marred by sporadic violent protests for a month. This led to schools being closed, shops looted and the local economy affected. “We can sit down with her but she is always busy, always out of town,” said Women’s League member, Arlene Bosman. “I am worried about the matrics who will write their trail exams very soon. So what does the premier say about this? Does that mean that everything is alright in her eyes?” another Women’s League member, Florence Speelman asked.
