Parliament says it will give an opportunity to the students of Rhodes University to make submissions on gender violence at their institution. This comes after one of Rhodes University law student Khensani Maseko reportedly took her own life last weekend after accusing her boyfriend of raping her on the university premises. Chairperson of Parliament’s Portfolio Committee on Police, Francois Beukman says the student leadership from Rhodes will be invited to the public hearings on violence and the implementation of the Domestic Violence Act later this month. “The portfolio committee on police will invite the student leadership of Rhodes University to attend the portfolio committee on police hearings on gender violence and the implementation of gender violence act on 28 and 29 August in 2018 in Cape Town. The death of Khensani Maseko is indeed a wakeup call to gender violence to the nation to deal with the lack of action by the relevant authorities. It is essential that the student leadership of Rhodes University and the relevant student role players should attend the portfolio committee for these hearings on gender violence.” Watch for more:
