The Presidency says it will approach the United States embassy in South Africa to obtain clarification on President Donald Trump’s tweet about the country’s land policy. In a late night tweet on Wednesday, Trump asked his Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to closely study South Africa’s shifting land policy. Trump tweeted at the conclusion of a programme on cable channel Fox News that had a six minute segment in which they claimed President Cyril Ramaphosa had begun seizing land from his citizens without compensating them for it because they are the wrong skin colour. On its Twitter page, government say it rejects what it terms as Trump’s “narrow perception” which seeks to divide the country and that the land reform process will be handled in a careful and inclusive manner.
