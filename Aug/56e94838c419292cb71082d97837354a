Business Leadership South Africa  has commended the appointment of new boards of the Airports Company SA (Acsa) and the South African National Roads Agency Ltd (Sanral). BLSA says it is a significant step towards restoring leadership integrity, good corporate governance and financial prudence in these entities. Cabinet announced its approval of the new boards last week. “We congratulate Themba Mhambi on his appointment as chairperson of Sanral, along with four non-executive directors. We also welcome the appointment of Nolulamo Gwagwa as chairperson of Acsa, and look forward to the finalisation of Phydelis Mvelase, Yershen Pillay, Bonang Mohale, Pascalis Mokupo, Nosizwe Nokwe-Macamo and Nqobizitha Phenyane as non-executive directors,” BLSA said in a statement. BLSA says the unfortunate tragedy of the last seven years is that these public entities have suffered major blows to their operational functionality and capability to deliver public value due to maladministration, corruption and state capture. “Over the past three years, four board members quit Acsa, two of which resigned over a lack of corporate governance at the entity, political interference, as well as issues of over-reach and undermining of the board by the Acsa executive.”  DV.load("https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4792300-BLSA-Media-Statement-on-ACSA-and-SANRAL.js", {
