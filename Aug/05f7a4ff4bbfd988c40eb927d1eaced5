The Democratic Alliance-led coalition government in the Nelson Mandela Bay is facing its biggest battle to date, after a high-level delegation of senior members from opposition parties are bringing a motion of no confidence against Mayor Athol Trollip. Last week, the United Democratic Movement, African Independent Congress, African National Congress and Economic Freedom Fighters met to discuss removing the coalition from power. Together, they have a 61-seat majority in the 120-seat council and would be able to pass any motions tabled. It’s expected that a special council meeting will be held on Friday but Speaker Jonathan Lawack has not confirmed that as yet. UDM councillor, Mongameli Bobani has warned that if the speaker does not respond, they’ll continue with the council meeting. “The speaker knows that the section 29 of the structures act immediately kicks in if the speaker fails to attend or not to respond to the meeting that the majority of the councilors requested on Friday to take place . And if he is not there we will mark him absent, it will be legal, we put it in our petition.” Nelson Mandela Bay Council Speaker, Johnathan Lawack says that the council meeting cannot go ahead without the speaker present and is still considering the special council meeting. “I can confirm that I have received the request for a special meeting to be held and at this point and time the matter is still under consideration/they must decide if they want to respect the law let me quote from the municipal structures act section 29, meetings of municipal councils: the speaker of the municipal council decides when and where the council meets.”
