Former North West premier, Supra Mahumapelo says his executive committee has not been informed of a possible provincial cabinet reshuffle. In an exclusive interview with SABC News recently, Premier Job Mokgoro, hinted that a reshuffle of the executive council was imminent. Mokgoro indicated that an assessment is being conducted on the performance of all the MECs to streamline the performance of the public service of government. However, Mahumapelo says they have not been consulted on the matter. “The things about possible reshuffling are insinuation we hear in the media, we were with professor Mokgoro, he attends every fortnight of the Provincial Working Committee, so this matter has never risen of the reshuffling. Its hearsay and rumours – so we have not had that discussion, so I cannot comment on that particular matter.” Meanwhile, an intimidation case involving Mahumapelo is expected to resume this week. The case was postponed to allow the justice department to deploy a new presiding officer over the matter. The accused, a Mahikeng local municipal councillor Ditebogo Molema, was arrested earlier in 2018 on charges of intimidation, after allegedly threatening to kill Mahumapelo by sending him messages on his cellphone. Molema is out on R3000 bail. Related video click below:
