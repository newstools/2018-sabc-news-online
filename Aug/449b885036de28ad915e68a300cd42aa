The African National Congress (ANC) has congratulated President Cyril Ramaphosa on his prompt appointment of acting National Director of Public Prosecutions, Dr Silas Ramaite. This follows Monday’s Constitutional Court ruling that found former president Jacob Zuma’s decision to appoint Shaun Abrahams invalid and ordered president Ramaphosa to appoint a new head within 90 days. The ANC says the appointment of Ramaite will go a long way in ensuring the nation gains confidence in the institution. The appointment of the acting NDPP is regarded as a step towards rebuilding the NPA. Ramaite is the NPA Deputy National Director for Administration and Office for Witness Protection. He has been at the helm for 15 years. In a statement, Ramaphosa has wished Ramaite well in his new role. Click video below:
