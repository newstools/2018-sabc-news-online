The South African Weather Service says chilly conditions are expected this weekend as seasons begin to change. The change in weather is caused by a high pressure system that will cause rain in Gauteng, Limpopo, Mpumalanga and KZN. Temperatures are expected to rise during the week, however, reaching the mid and high twenties. “Theoretically, we are still in the winter season. We haven’t moved into springtime yet. We are transitioning into Spring… so we will still experience a bit of cold snaps here are there until winter is officially over which will be the 1st of September,” says forecaster, Tsholofelo Mahlangu. “For now, we still can get some cold fronts.”
