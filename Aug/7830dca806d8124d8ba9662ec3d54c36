Professor Bongani Mayosi has been described as the epitome of black excellence and a community builder at a memorial service in East London. He was the Dean of Sciences at University of Cape Town. The Eastern Cape government hosted the memorial to celebrate his life. He was buried last week in Cape Town. Professor Mayosi took his own life after suffering from depression. Biding farewell to a respected medical intellectual. The Baptist church in East London was packed with academics, government officials and church members to celebrate the life of the late Professor Bongani Mayosi. He was a researcher and a scientist at the University of Cape Town. He died on the 27th of July aged 51. Eastern Cape Health MEC Sauls August described his death is a great loss to the health sector. He says: “While Prof Mayosi is no longer with us physically his work must continue. His dreams of the poor must be realised in his honour. Let us honour the gigantic milestones that Prof has achieved in his lifetime.” His friend Dr Khulile Moeketsi says he is still devastated by the passing on of Mayosi. “This is a man committed in lifting people who did not believe in themselves. He would turn them into great believers in themselves. There’s one lady who is an exceptionally researcher who was a cleaner, professor Mayosi engaged and assisted her and now she is participating and helping us to do excellent research.” ANC provincial chairperson and Finance MEC Oscar Mabuyane has called on young doctors to emulate Mayosi’s leadership skills. “It’s a pity that there are no young doctors present here because I was going to tell them that we need more of Mayoli in this province we need more researchers and Scientists let us disappoint and multiply his life.” A call has also been made to government to rename the cardiology division at Nelson Mandela Academic hospital after Professor Mayosi in honour of his contribution.
