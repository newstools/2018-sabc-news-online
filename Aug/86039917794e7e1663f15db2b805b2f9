The second week of the state capture inquiry gets underway Monday morning in Johannesburg with former African National Congress (ANC) MP Vytjie Mentor expected to testify. Mentor is one of the people who was interviewed by former public protector Thuli Madonsela in her investigation into state capture. The inquiry is headed by Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo. Mentor’s testimony comes just days after former Deputy Finance Minister Mcebisi Jonas testified that in October 2015, Ajay Gupta had offered him a bribe of R600 million and the position of finance minister, two months before Nhlanhla Nene was removed from the position. Mentor is expected to reveal more details about how the politically connected Gupta family offered her the position of Public Enterprises Minister back in 2010. This was apparently in exchange for cancelling the South African Airways route to India. The cancellation of this route was allegedly set to benefit India-based Jet Airways and Abu Dhabi’s Etihad Airways. Mentor first revealed the alleged Gupta bribe in a Facebook post in March 2016. She further claimed that former President Jacob Zuma was in another room when she was offered the job at the Gupta home in Saxonworld. In her report, Madonsela said Mentor told her that Zuma did not appear angry that she had declined the offer. WATCH RELATED VIDEOS BELOW:
