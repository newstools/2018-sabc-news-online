British Prime Minister Theresa May says the decline of state based war and conflict has now been replaced by new threats which include terrorism. May says such threats are affecting both Africa and Europe. She was addressing a business meeting in Cape Town ahead of bilateral discussions with the South African government. May landed in Cape Town Tuesday morning. She is on an African tour to strengthen economic and trade relations between Africa and the United Kingdom. May says in the past five years terrorists have killed 20 000 people in Africa. She says: “From the 2013 siege in Nairobi’s West Gate shopping centre to last year’s truck bombing in Mogadishu and March’s Al Qaida attack in Burkina Faso, whether in Europe and Africa, Non-State actors are threatening our lives and radicalising our people.” “From cyber attacks on national infrastructure and institutions to the use of chemical weapons on the streets of the UK and Syria.”
