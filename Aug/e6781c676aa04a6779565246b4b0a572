Former African National Congress (ANC) MP, Vytjie Mentor, will on Tuesday morning continue giving evidence before the State Capture Inquiry. Mentor is the third witness to testify before the commission sitting in Parktown, Johannesburg. She detailed her various encounters with the Gupta brothers, Duduzane Zuma and former President Jacob Zuma while she was Chair of the Public Enterprises Committee of Parliament. The Inquiry has been urged to allow implicated individuals at the commission who want to cross-examine witnesses to do so with conditions. Implicated persons whose names have come up in the Inquiry, have asked Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo, to allow them to cross examine witnesses. In her testimony on Monday, Mentor implicated then Head of Private Office Lakela Kaunda, saying Kaunda had set up a meeting between her and former President Jacob Zuma. Last week, former deputy Finance Minister Mcebisi Jonas, accused Hawks Major General Zinhle Mnonopi of deliberately trying to sabotage the investigation into the Guptasâ€™ alleged attempt to bribe him. Legal team member Vincent Maleka has urged Zondo to address these concerns. Watch related video below:
