Deputy President David Mabuza has urged South Africans to wage a struggle against the abuse of women and children. Mabuza was speaking at a national prayer day in Ellis Park stadium in Johannesburg on Saturday. He says the scourge of gender-based violence has created pain for the country. “We are confronted once more with the degeneration of our human values, immorality, the sloth and deviant afflictions to the nation. Our country is in pain, pain at the hands of men who grievously abuse those in our midst that are vulnerable,” says Mabuza. He says religious leaders helped liberate South Africa and they can take it forward. “The struggle to liberate this country started in a church. It was religious leaders that met and said as South Africans lets unite and free ourselves and today I hear a voice coming from the same religious leaders who say, let’s unite and fight the social ills,” says Mabuza. The event was well attended by different faith groups to help guide the country to a newer vision and mindset on social crimes. Watch the video below for his full speech:
