The Independent Police Investigative Directorate(IPID) has arrested three SAPS members at Muden near Greytown in the KwaZulu midlands in connection with the murder of a 37- year-old man. Mbongiseni Ndlela went missing on August 2 after he had handed himself over to police who wanted to question him in connection with a murder case, he never returned home. Over the weekend Ndlela’s family staged a sit-in at the Muden police station demanding that the police tell them where their brother’s body was. IPID spokesperson Moses Dlamini says the three officers will appear in court on Wednesday. The body of the deceased was found in the afternoon around 17:30. Three police officials will appear at the Greytown magistrate court on charges of murder, assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm and defeating the ends of justice.
