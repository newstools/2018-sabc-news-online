President Cyril Ramaphosa is back in Parliament on Wednesday to reply to oral questions from members of the National Assembly. The assembly will also have a debate on women’s month entitled “Women united in moving South Africa forward”. In addition, more than 30 meetings of committees are scheduled. The questions the President will face relate to, among others, the high unemployment figures released by Statistics South Africa, the review of the list of zero-rated items to mitigate the impact of the VAT increase and the Independent Power Producers agreements. Minister Jeff Radebe will appear before the Energy Committee following the scathing criticism by the committee last week when he and the department failed to pitch. Among the legislative matters to be considered by committee are the Road Accident Benefit Scheme Bill, the Administrative Adjudication Road Traffic Offences Amendment Bill, the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill, the Tax Administration Laws Amendment Bill and the Small Enterprises Ombud Service Bill. On Thursday, the National Assembly sitting will express condolences for the late Sibusiso Radebe and Zelda Jongbloed who died recently.
