The adjourned council meeting of  Nelson Mandela Bay resumes on Monday after opposition parties walked out earlier this month. They did not return to the chamber after a short adjournment over the printing of a delayed agenda. The meeting was to debate, amongst other things, a vote of no confidence in Mayor Athol Trollip, speaker Jonathan Lawack and chief whip Werner Senekal. The opposition is unlikely to get the support of the Patriotic Alliance after a fallout with the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) over the mayorship position. Patriotic Alliance councillor, Marion Daniels says their decision is clear. “Had the Patriotic Alliance not revisited its decision having engagements with opposition parties it would have not panned out like this if we had given our support to the opposition parties. They would have remained in Council and it’s a decision that we have taken and it’s a right decision that has led them walking out. Because they realise they do not have numbers on their side. But we will never give our support, not today, not tomorrow, not ever again to such parties.” WATCH RELATED VIDEOS:
