A search operation will resume this morning for a 2-year-old boy presumed to have drowned in the Klipvalley river stream in Kliptown, Soweto, last Friday. The boy, from an informal settlement not far from the river, was playing with a friend along the river when he was swept away by water. Johannesburg Emergency Services spokesperson Robert Mulaudzi says they wish for parents to guard and monitor young children at all times. “We just want to urge our residents especially parents and guardians to monitor young children while playing, to stay away from these river streams so that we can prevent drowning incidents which might occur”.
