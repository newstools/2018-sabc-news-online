The Democratic Alliance (DA) in Gauteng says it is concerned about more babies dying at the Thelle Mogoerane Hospital in Vosloorus, Ekurhuleni. It says nine babies died this past weekend at the hospital and that the management is covering this up. The DA cites workers at the hospital as saying that the CEO enjoys political protection which allows her to cover up wrong doing and to act with impunity. The party’s Jack Bloom says they want know if more babies are dying because of poor hygiene, overcrowding and cross infection. “I have sent the list of babies that allegedly died this past weekend to the Head of the Department, and I hope that he takes action on it to investigate whether these babies did die at this hospital and what could be the causes and make sure that there is full investigation.”
