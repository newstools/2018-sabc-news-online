Calm has returned to White City, Soweto, after some residents embarked on a looting spree on Wednesday. This followed protests over claims thatÂ foreign-owned shops were selling expired goods. Two people were killed during the violence and one was critically wounded and was admitted to hospital. Twenty-seven people have been arrested for various crimes including murder, attempted murder, possession of unlicensed firearms and public violence. All foreign owned Spaza shops in parts of Soweto are closed. On a normal day, in the morning, their shops are opened but Thursday morning only garbage can be seen outside the Spaza shops that were looted. Tensions have been simmering for some time over allegations that foreign-owned shops sell expired and fake goods to local residents. Police have urged foreign shop owners to remove goods from shelves until the situation is normalized. Law enforcement agencies have been deployed to monitor the situation. Related videos
