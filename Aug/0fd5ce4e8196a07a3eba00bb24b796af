The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) has welcomed the removal of Athol Trollip as the Mayor of Nelson Mandela Bay Metro on Monday. Its leader, Julius Malema says arrogance and lack of consultation with other political parties within the metro is the reason he has now been ousted. A vote of no confidence in Trollip was passed after all Democratic Alliance (DA) council members left the chamber. The DA plans to challenge the validity of the motion in court.
