Police have opened a case of culpable homicide following a bus crash in which five people including a seven-month-old baby were killed on the R66 between eShowe and Melmoth in northern KwaZulu-Natal on Saturday. More than 30 other people were injured. The bus was apparently carrying members of the 12 Apostles Church from Johannesburg to an event in Empangeni when the crash happened. The driver lost control of the bus and it veered off the road. A case of culpable homicide will be opened. Police spokesperson Thembheka Mbhele says the families of the victims have not yet been informed. “I can confirm five fatalities including one seven-month-old child, three women and one man. We were informed in the initial investigation that the driver lost control and the bus overturned on the cliff there.” Watch for more:
