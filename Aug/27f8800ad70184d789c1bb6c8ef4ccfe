Duduzane Zuma is on Thursday expected back in the Randburg Magistrate’s Court, north of Johannesburg. The son of former President Jacob Zuma has been charged with two counts of culpable homicide following a fatal car crash on the M1 highway in Johannesburg in 2014. One of the victims, Phumzile Dube was killed after Zuma’s Porsche collided with the taxi in which she was travelling. Her fellow passenger Nanki Mashaba‚ who was also injured in the crash died in hospital a few weeks later. During Duduzane Zuma’s previous court appearrance last month, the case was postponed to allow the state time to submit all relevant documents to his lawyers. A few days prior, he was released on bail of R100 000 by the Johannesburg Specialised Crimes Court, after he was formally charged with corruption for allegedly trying to bribe then deputy Finance Minister Mcebisi Jonas in October 2015. Just over a week after he was released on bail, Zuma again made headlines when it emerged that he had left the country for Dubai to spend time with his pregnant wife. The NPA said however that it was aware of his whereabouts and he had not violated his bail conditions. Related Videos
