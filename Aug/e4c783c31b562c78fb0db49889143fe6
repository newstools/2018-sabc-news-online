A 35-year-old Zimbabwean national is expected to appear in the Mogwase Magistrate’s Court in the North-West on Monday. This comes after he allegedly stabbed his 47-year-old girlfriend to death. Meanwhile, residents of Moruleng near Mogwase in Rustenburg are expected to picket outside the court and demand that the suspect be denied bail. Bassie Matjila, a spokesperson of the Thuso Ya Batho Anti-Crime Non-Governmental Organization, says they have to do something; they cannot fold their hands or keep quiet. “For the fact that he had committed a heinous crime by killing a woman inside her house, at the very same time we are in Women’s Month, but besides that, almost on a daily basis women are being killed in our country. We cannot fold our hands and zip our month. People are being arrested and released on bail”.
