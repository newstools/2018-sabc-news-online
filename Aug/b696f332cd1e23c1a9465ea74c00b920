The Chief Executive Officer of South African Wind Energy, Brenda Martin, says the country’s wind power potential can, in the next few years, generate at least 40% of South Africa’s electricity. She says renewable energy currently only contributes about 8% to the national energy mix. Martin was speaking on the side lines of the Renewable Energy Conference and Exhibition taking place in De Aar in the Northern Cape. “We have a very good set of leadership between the Presidency and the energy minister in terms of setting the agenda and making it clear that South Africa has to improve its investment in order to improve its economic strength. From that perspective things are looking very good. We also have at the moment around for projects being implemented with construction beginning on the first projects later this year and from an implementation perspective this also spells a very positive future for the industry.”
