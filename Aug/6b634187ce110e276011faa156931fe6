Elderly disabled women in the Eastern Cape feel marginalised and neglected. They claim they are on the back burner when it comes to basic service delivery. They say there is very little to celebrate during August, the month meant to commemorate women. 89-year-old Nomzamo Gladys Blekiwe lives with five of her grandchildren. She is the only one who receives a government grant. Six years ago tragedy struck, when she was hit by a car and crippled. “It really pains me that I do not have a wheelchair. My knees are sore it feels like it got broken from the inside. I used to be fresh and vibrant but now I feel like a loner and so ashamed of myself,” says Blekiwe. The community has come together to assist her. “We saw a video of mama and it touched us and we thought we should come and help because that is the reason we formed the group,” says Bongiwe Qongqo from Community Activism Group. The problems faced by the women are wide spread. In Xhora women with disabilities don’t have ablution facilities. The OR Tambo disabled people’s organisation says government’s policy on people with disability is clear. But it only works on paper and there are no practical implications. “When it’s time to vote they come to my house but when it’s time for service delivery I get neglected. I use my neighbour’s toilet by the name of Nohajam Mkhenkese. I never received an RDP house and yet everyone nearby has toilets and houses,” says disabled Nomfuneko Mboxo. “My son was shot and got injured. Other people have toilets but we don’t have toilets. My son is disabled and we struggle a lot,” says Nomncekelelo Nohonqwana. The Department of Social Development has encouraged people to approach the department. The donation of something as simple as a wheelchair is life changing for Nomzamo Blekiwe. Even though Blekiwe has received a wheelchair, her situation remains dire. It reflects the plight faced by elderly women in rural areas.
