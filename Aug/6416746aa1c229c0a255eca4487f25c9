The DA says the Broadcasting Complaints Commission of South Africa (BCCSA) has agreed to hold a tribunal into the SABC‘s airing of a video of President Cyril Ramaphosa’s land expropriation announcement more than two weeks ago. Ramaphosa was speaking in his capacity as ANC president. The DA is adamant that the SABC contravened the BCCSA Code of Conduct. The party has accused the SABC of refusing to broadcast a packaged video of DA leader Mmusi Maimane replying to Ramaphosa. The SABC says it gave the DA an opportunity on its Morning Live television programme the next day. The DA’s Phumzile van Damme says the tribunal, set for the fifth of next month, will deal with this matter. “We are pleased that the BCCSA has chosen the route of a tribunal, which means that the hearing will be open to the public and both parties will be able to make their arguments. We hope that a president will set in this case which will protect the SABC from being a mouth piece for the ANC.”
