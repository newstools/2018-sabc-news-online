The African National Congress in the Free State is in full swing with the programme of action to renew and restore its dignity in the province. During a media briefing in Bloemfontein, the ANC says the primary focus will be on the troubled municipalities to ensure stability and instill discipline. The programme will also accelerate other organisational activities aiming at oiling the ANC elections machinery. The ANC is in the process to clean itself to regain the lost ground as it prepares for 2019 general elections. It also maintains that it won’t be threatened by individuals who want to resolve the party issues in court. PEC has acted against Maluti-A -Phofung councillors who defied the ANC during the election of a mayor. FS ANC secretary Paseka Nompondo says: “Some members of the ANC ganged up together and connived with the opposition and formed the government of their own outside of the ANC.  Therefore, that constituted an act of misconduct and that’s why the ANC PEC, PWC acted – because those positions belong to the party not the individuals.” ANC says the issue has been escalated to the provincial disciplinary committee and it will focus on strengthening branches and regional structures.
