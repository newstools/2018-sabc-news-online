A severe storm warning has been issued for Buffalo City around East London and surrounding towns by the weather office. People have been warned to be cautious on the roads amid strong and windy weather conditions that have hit the city. Over 50 shacks have been destroyed by fire in East London’s Duncan Village, leaving scores of residents homeless. The cause of the fire is still unknown. Buffalo City Spokesperson Samkelo Ngwena says they are working with government agencies to help provide food and shelter for victims. “We have been working with the South African Social Security Agency to provide those who are affected. We have also been working with Home Affairs to assist with registering them for government grants. Our disaster management has offered them blankets,” says Ngwenya.
