The South Africa Social Security Agency (Sassa) in Limpopo has appealed to more than 64 000 social grant recipients who are yet to apply for the new Sassa card, to do so before the end of September. The agency’s acting Regional Manager, Matshidiso Mamabolo says this number amounts to a quarter of Sassa recipients in the province. Sassa’s contract with Cash Paymaster Services is being phased out at the end of the month, with the South African Post office (Sapo) taking over social grant payments. Mamabolo explains says, “We have managed to really card-swap more than three quarters of the people who were using the old Sassa card. But we are still concerned about the remaining 64 thousand people – this will be the last month wherein Sassa will deposit money into the old card. So I am appealing to all of them to come forward as and when they go to the pay points during the pay cycle of September, to bring their Identity books, so that we can card swap them and give them the relevant card.” Mamabolo adds that Sassa and Sapo will only visit only about five-hundred of more than nine-hundred cash payment points in the province in September, while preparing to take over all of them from October.
