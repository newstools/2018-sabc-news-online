Eastern Cape Premier Phumulo Masualle has lauded the late ambassador Stephens Pangula Gawe for his contribution in the struggle. He was delivering a eulogy at Gawe’s official provincial funeral in the Peelton Congregational Church outside Bhisho. Gawe, who was an activist and later ambassador to Denmark, died aged 80 three weeks ago while visiting his daughter in the United Kingdom. Masualle has urged the youth to learn from Gawe’s legacy. “We gather here to reflect on the life and legacy of a revolutionary who understood that ours would not be a struggle for liberation that would be won on the streets of our township and villages and even went to the international community just for the mess of the struggle.” Meanwhile, Gawe’s children Nomtha and Vuyo have described their father as a humble and loving person. “I have heard so many people over the past few weeks talk about our dad’s amazing talents and achievements, but his humility means a lot to us at this time around.” “If we were hurt or sad he would hug us tightly rocking us of his love. He would never leave us until we need him no more.” Click video below:
