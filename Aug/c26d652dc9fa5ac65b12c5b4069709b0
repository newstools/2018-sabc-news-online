The Presidency says President Cyril Ramaphosa is studying the Constitutional Court’s judgement that found the appointment of National Director of Public Prosecutions (NDPP), Shaun Abrahams invalid; and will ensure that the leadership problems at the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) are addressed urgently. In a statement, the presidency says it is cognisant of the order directing President Ramaphosa to appoint a new NPA head within 90 days and that he will communicate his decision in due course. The Constitutional Court found that former President Jacob Zuma‘s decision to appoint Abrahams was unconstitutional as well as his removal of former NDPP Mxolisi Nxasana from the position. The court ordered Nxasana to pay back R10.3 million of the R17.3 million he received as a golden handshake when he was removed.  Nxasana says he may not be able to pay back the money as he has not been working since his contract was terminated three years ago. “When I was appointed I had built a practice for more than 15 years, and I had to give up my practice to come and serve at the NPA and you know what then follows. At the end of it, in as much as I am vindicated and the Constitution has been vindicated, I am a loser in the fact that I have been ordered to pay back the settlement.” Click below for more on the story:
