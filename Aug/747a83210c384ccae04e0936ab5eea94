Former Steinhoff Chief Executive Markus Jooste will not appear before Parliament on Wednesday. Jooste reached an alternative agreement with the Standing Committees on Finance and Public Accounts, and the Portfolio Committees on Trade and Industry, and Public Service and Administration. In terms of the agreement he will now appear on September 5. Jooste will be expected to give evidence under oath around the events which led to the collapse of the share price of Steinhoff. Members of Parliament hope that he will help them identify any institutional flaws and challenges that exist in current financial legislation. Parliament’s spokesperson Moloto Mothapo says Jooste’s appearance next week is now definite, having been formalised through a draft order of the Cape High Court. Moloto Mothapo says:”With regard to Mr Jooste, we’ve been having on-going discussions between parliament and himself in order to determine an appropriate date that he can appear before parliament. We’ve reached an agreement that September 5 would be the most appropriate date for him to appear before parliament and that has since been officialised by way of a court order.” Related video click below:
