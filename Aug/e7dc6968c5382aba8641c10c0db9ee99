North West Premier Job Mokgoro has hinted that a Provincial Executive Council reshuffle is imminent. Since taking over the reins of the provincial government, Premier Job Mokgoro has been conducting an assessment of the performance of all the MEC’s. His predecessor, Supra Mahumapelo, resigned in May amid a revolt against his leadership, and several provincial departments were then put under administration. In an exclusive interview with SABC News, Mokgoro was asked about a possible reshuffle. “I can confirm that I am doing an assessment on the capabilities of the entire provincial state and that includes the executive. Certainly, we need to streamline the performance of the public service of government. We also want to make sure that as part of our effort to restore confidence in our people the decisions that are taken should take that into account.” Meanwhile, Mahumapelo says he does not see anything wrong in Mokgoro’s reversal of all the provincial government’s programmes he had adopted. Those programmes include Setsokotsane, Village Township and Small Dorpies, Rebranding and Renewal. Mahumapelo’s critics including opposition parties in the province believed his programmes were meant to loot state funds. Mahumapelo is unperturbed by Mokgoro’s moves to end them. “Any premier, any president who comes in, they develop and introduce their own style of leading. Now, Professor Mokgoro, as the new premier, has no obligation to do and adopt what I introduced when I came in. If he wants to come with his own style of leading he is welcomed to do so. We must support him in whatever he does.”
