Police Minister, Bheki Cele, says security agencies are working tirelessly to combat cross-border crime. Cele visited eManguzi in the Umhlabuyalingana district in far northern KwaZulu-Natal to give residents feedback on efforts to fight cross-border crime. The area has been ravaged by syndicates who smuggle vehicles across the border to Mozambique. Cele says, since the beginning of the year, more than 300 suspects have been arrested and scores of stolen vehicles retrieved. Cele, who was accompanied by his provincial counterpart MEC Mxolisi Kaunda, said the South African government has since taken a stance to strengthen the country’s anti-crime strategy at the borders. “More than 300 suspects have been arrested, 102 cars have been retrieved, 43 guns have been found, illegal firearms. So it’s not just restricted to here but there are operations across the border of Mozambique and South Africa. The biggest solution and the biggest hindrance was that there was no communication between the officials of those two countries. Now it has been escalated to the ministerial level and reporting to the president that has been the biggest achievement. There are two countries working together,” says Cele.
