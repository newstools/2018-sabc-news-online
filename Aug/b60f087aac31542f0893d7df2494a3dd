Six years since the Marikana tragedy, there’s uncertainty about job security, as thousands of mineworkers around the Rustenburg Platinum Belt face retrenchment. Speaking to thousands of mineworkers converged to pay homage to the 34 mineworkers who lost their lives on this day in 2012, Amcu president Joseph Mathunjwa threatened to bring the platinum belt to a standstill. Mathunjwa has warned that members of his union will go on strike for a year if Impala Platinum carries out plans to cut up to 13 400 jobs. Mathunjwa was addressing thousands of union members at a memorial event marking the sixth anniversary of the Marikana massacre when police shot dead 34 striking workers at Lonmin’s platinum mine. Last week, Mineral Resources Minister Gwede Mantashe lashed out at GoldFields’ plans to cut 1100 permanent jobs at its loss-making South Deep mine. Earlier, Mathunjwa criticised government for not taking full responsible for the Marikana massacre. “We demand that the 16 of August be declared a public holiday. This is the day where government killed black people. We want this day to be Workers Day. So that it reminds all of us of our struggle.”   Platinum miner Lonmin, once the darling of the market, has seen its share price drop from 55 880 to 700. Six years ago, Lonmin’s nightmare started as police opened fire and shot miners who were striking for wage hikes.
The events of the Marikana massacre leading to the killings of 34 not only destabilised the mining sector, but put Lonmin on the brink of collapse. The third largest mining producer lost most of its market capitalisation. From August 2012 to date, its market cap has dropped almost 315 billion. The share price dropped from 55 880 from August and is today trading at a price of 700. Lonmin has been hit with extremely difficult times.
