Community members of the transit camp in Isipingo south of Durban have blocked the road with burning tyres and rubble in a service delivery protest this morning. A community member, Zamile Sosibo, says they were told they would stay only eight months in the camp before being given proper houses. Sosibo says it’s been ten years now and the Ethekwini Municipality has not addressed their plight. “We are protesting because we want service delivery. It’s been ten years now we have been staying here when it rains water comes into our houses. The Mayor came here last year on October 14 and she promised she’ll do something. They sent the senior manager of Ethekwini to come check the situation he made promises as well now we are tired of staying in this place”. However, police spokesperson Nqobile Gwala says the police are in the area to monitor the situation. “This morning about 150 people embarked in a protest action on the M35 near Isipingo library. The police are at the scene to stabilize the situation and no incident has been reported at this stage”.
