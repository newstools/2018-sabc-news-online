The EFF Student Command has condemned, what it calls police brutality that led to the death of one student and scores others being injured at the Tshwane University of Technology’s Soshanguve Campus north of Pretoria. Six students were arrested and two vehicles torched as violence flared up Thursday night. It’s alleged that police fired shots at students who were protesting over alleged rigging of SRC elections. The EFF Student Command’s Sakhile Khoza says those responsible for the death of the student, who belonged to the PAC student wing PASMA must be brought to book. Khoza says: “We are closing this campus until management have something to give us on what the way forward is. We lost our brother, our fellow student and this issue is affecting all of us. We support PASMA on their loss. So we are fighting for our students.”
