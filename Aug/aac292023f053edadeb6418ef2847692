The Cabinet Lekgotla currently under way in Pretoria is seeking ways to stimulate the agricultural sector through the release of pieces of land that government has already identified. The two day meeting will also discuss issues related to the African National Congress‘ (ANC) decision to support the amendment of the Constitution to expropriate land without compensation and gender-based violence. “Already the first is that of the release of over 100 pockets of land that the Department of Rural Development has already identified and the farmer support that would actually be concluded here today and we are quite certain that we will be presenting to South Africans actions going into the next 6th administration but as well as the 25 review of where South Africa comes from,” says Communications Minister Nomvula Mokonyane.
