The public has until 21 September to comment on National Health Insurance’s  two bills, the Medical Aid Schemes Bill and the National Healthcare Insurance Bill (NHI). This was released by Minister of Health Dr Aaron Motsoaledi. The Institute of Race Relations has also invited South Africans to endorse its submission opposing NHI fund, saying that it will disrupt South Africa’s healthcare system, with dire consequences for all South Africans, whether they rely on private or public health services. Campaign Manager for the Institute of Race Relations Marius Roodt says,” They are not sure if the NHI will function well because cost will be too much for South Africa to bear, we have seen that in general the government has done poorly managing big entities such as SAA and Eskom. There is no reason to think that it will do any better running the NHI.” Department of Health’s Deputy Director-General for Health Regulation and Compliance Dr Anban Pillay says there is an exaggeration about the NHI, “This system is intended to befit all South Africans.” Click link for full interview
