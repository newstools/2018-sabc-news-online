Relations between the government and traditional leaders have improved over the years. That is the view of many who attended the annual uMmemo ceremony in Magogeni near the Swaziland border. The event is aimed at celebrating cultural heritage and raising awareness about government initiatives. It is an annual celebration with the Swati people showing pride in their culture. Young and old turned up. “We are here to learn more about our culture, we are showing that we are proud of who we are,” says one of the attendees. The event is also popular with people from neighbouring Swaziland and Mozambique. It has also helped to improve relations between government and traditional leaders. “We are always part of such events because we need to work together with traditional leaders in order to deliver services to our communities,” says Nkomazi Municipality Mayor Johan Mkhatshwa. Mhlaba Traditional Authority’s Inkosi Ndlemane the second says; “We are having a great working relationship with government, we are very grateful of that because we are all able to reach out to our people.” Similar events will be held in other areas in Mpumalanga.
