The ANC in Mpumalanga has called on its members to be disciplined as the party prepares for its provincial general council scheduled for September. This follows a bishop captured on a video alleging that Deputy President David Mabuza is a murderer. The allegations were made during a campaign of one of the hopefuls for the provincial ANC’s vacant chairperson post. The ANC provincial leadership wants Deputy President Mabuza to take the matter to court to clear his name. ANCYL’s Pholoso Mbatsane says, “There are lot of people who have been saying bad things about the deputy president even when he was the chairperson. And now there is this bishop. We are saying this is a chance for the deputy president to clear his name. He must go to court.” ANC Spokesperson Sasekani Manzini says, “In Mpumalanga, we do not have a problem with anyone campaigning, but people must be disciplined as we prepare for the PGC. Branches will pronounce themselves and whatever outcome must be accepted by everyone.” Manzini says preparations for the PGC are at an advanced stage. Over five candidates are campaigning to fill the vacant chairperson post after the elevation of Mabuza.
