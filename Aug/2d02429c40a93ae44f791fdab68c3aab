Three suspects are expected to appear in the Verulam Magistrate’s Court after a rock was thrown off a bridge over the N2 highway near Tongaat on the KwaZulu-Natal north coast. Two children were killed in the incident which happened in December last year. Provincial police spokesperson Thembeka Mbhele says the suspects will be facing three charges. “Three suspects were arrested between the ages of 22 and 46. They will be facing two counts of murder and one of attempted murder. This is after December; the victims were travelling along the N2 towards Durban when the stones were thrown over them. Two died and one was seriously injured. As the police we are still patrolling the area and since, the throwing of stones decreased.”
