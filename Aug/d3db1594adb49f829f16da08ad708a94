Public hearings to discuss the National Land Transport Amendment Bill in the Western Cape have been concluded. Hearings took place in George and the Cape Town. The bill, also referred to as the Uber Bill, sets out to regulate the e-hailing industries including Uber and Taxify. The Chairperson of the provincial Standing Committee on Transport and Public Works, Nceba Hinana, says a number of issues came up during the public hearings. “The Bill proposes colour coding or using symbols to mark e-hailing vehicles. However, the transport industry is marked by intense competition, taxi violence, and train and bus arson.” “Therefore, putting markings on e-hailing vehicles could make them easy prey to violence. The next stage in the legislative process is for written submissions and comments to be sent in.” Related video click below:
