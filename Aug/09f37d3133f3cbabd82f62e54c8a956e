Gauteng Premier David Makhura says the hunderds of ANC supporters who attended the night vigil in Pretoria ahead of Thursday’s motion of no confidence in Tshwane Executive Mayor Solly Msimanga are prepared to sacrifice their lives for a better future. Makhura says he has faced several motions of no confidence in the provincial legislature. He says Msimanga must also face the motion. He says: “It’s a labour of love, it’s not something nice to do. People are sacraficing by doing it but because they want to achieve another higher objective, the night vigil is a labour of love.” “You have to sacrifice if you want something better so that’s what people are doing they are forgoing sleep because they want something better,” adds Makhura.  Msimanga will face two motions of no confidence against him on Thursday, the other coming from the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF). The ANC’s motion of no confidence in Msimanga relates to tender fraud allegedly involving City Manager Moeketsi Mosola and engineering consultancy firm GladAfrica. The EFF on the other hand accuses Msimanga of not consulting with other parties in the crucial running of the city and giving jobs to people without necessary qualifications. Meanwhile, the Democratic Alliance (DA) has vowed to support Msimanga. Speaking after the DA’s Federal Executive meeting in Johannesburg on Wednesday, party leader Mmusi Maimane says any attempt to remove Msimanga is an assault on the people of South Africa. He adds that South Africans will have to choose between what he calls a coalition of corruption, and clean governance. Related video
