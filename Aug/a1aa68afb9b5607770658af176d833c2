The African National Congress’ (ANC) National Working Committee (NWC) is in the North West province. They want to get to the bottom of organisational problems within the ruling party in the province. President Cyril Ramaphosa spoke at a meeting with branches at the Rustenburg Convention Centre. The working committee also had meetings in Mahikeng, Klerksdorp and Vryburg. Receiving a warm welcome from hundreds of branch members President Ramaphosa addressed the ANC’s organisational problems within the Province. But the same could not be said of former North West Premier Supra Mahumapelo. He was booed off stage as he tried to address the masses. The media was escorted out of the venue and told that it would not be allowed to cover any of the proceedings. Collen Maine ANC NEC member says: “We are here to mobilize and energize our structures to gear themselves up for the election campaign.” Some branch members were also not allowed to participate. When asked about the state of affairs in the provincial structure, opinions differed. “As the organisation, we are not going to listen to comrades who have been funded to say Supra Mahumapelo must go. The PEC must be disbanded. People from other sub-regions are being paid to say the PEC must not be disbanded,” says a branch member. “There is no organisation in the North West. This gathering signifies the fact that there are serious problems. There are different parallel structures in regions and that in itself is a manifestation of serious underlying political problems,” adds another branch member. “We don’t support this motion of disbanding the current PEC because we don’t see the necessity to disband, because we are left only with less than eight months,” says another branch member. The working committee will meet the provincial executive committee, in Mahikeng on Monday. WATCH BELOW:
