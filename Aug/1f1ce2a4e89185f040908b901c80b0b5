Lonmin Platinum Mines’ annual Marikana commemoration is under way outside Rustenburg in the North West. The ceremony remembers the 44 people who died six years ago at Marikana. On 16 August 2012, 34 striking mine workers were shot dead by police. Ten other people, including two security guards and two police officers, were also killed during the protracted wage strike at Lonmin. Lonmin’s commemoration is usually held as a prelude to the main event organised by the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (AMCU). Throughout the commemoration, the company reflects on what happened during 2012 and measures what has been put in place to ensure that the incident does not re-occur. Unlike AMCU’s main event, family members of the two security guards that were killed are invited. Lonmin’s CEO Ben Magara will be addressing the event.
