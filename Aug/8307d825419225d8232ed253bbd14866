Twenty-four members of Zimbabwe’s defeated opposition Movement For Democratic Change (MDC) Alliance will be back in court on Monday on charges related to the violence that broke out in the capital last week, following the announcement of the Parliamentary election results. They were arrested in a police raid at the MDC Alliance’s headquarters in Harare. They appeared in court in the capital on Friday on charges of committing public violence. Six people died in the violent protests that saw the deployment of the army in the capital.  MDC Alliance leader Nelson Chamisa has reiterated that his party doesn’t accept the results of both the Presidential and Parliamentary elections and that it would pursue all legal and constitutional means of challenging Zanu-PF leader, Emmerson Mnangagwa’s win. Meanwhile, a small group of Mnangagwa’s ruling Zanu-PF supporters marched through central Harare in party colours on Sunday chanting “In” to show their belief that their man will stay in office. Harare residents had mixed feelings regarding what should happen next, with one man saying he would not accept the results, suggesting a rerun election or inclusive government while another said “I want the country to move forward.” On Friday, Mnangagwa urged Zimbabweans to unite after he was declared the first elected head of state since Robert Mugabe’s removal from power in November.  MDC leader Nelson Chamisa insisted he had won and pledged to challenge the result. Additional Reporting Reuters
