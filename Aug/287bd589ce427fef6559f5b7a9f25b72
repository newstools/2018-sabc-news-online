The African National Congress (ANC) Caucus in the City of Cape Town has reiterated its call for the allegations against Cape Town Mayor, Patricia de Lille to be tested in a disciplinary process. In a joint media briefing with party leader Mmusi Maimane, De Lille resigned as Mayor with effect from the 31 October, following a long battle with the Democratic Alliance (DA). Reacting to the development, ANC Caucus leader Xolani Sotashe accused the DA of using De Lille’s resignation to elect a Mayor that Capetonians did not vote for. “Ours as the ANC was always to state her case. They are on record saying she is corrupt; the DA has now made a huge u-turn. So we must continue to probe what is going on. We must interrogate the Steenhuisen and Bowman reports. They abused De Lille.” Meanwhile, De Lille expressed relief that the disciplinary charges have been set aside. “Now that the charges have been dropped and have been withdrawn, I can now go on with my life and invest the additional time that I will have on focusing on the real reason why I accepted the position as Mayor in the first place which is to build a better city, to build a better country, to build an alternative to the ANC and to make sure that we save our country.” Click below for more on the story:
