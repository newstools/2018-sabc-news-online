EFF Student Command Peter Keetse says there’s no sufficient support for students who suffer from depression at South Africa’s institutions of higher learning. He says incidents of the so-called rape culture are largely ignored. Keetse was speaking at the funeral service of Rhodes University law student Khensani Maseko in Johannesburg on Thursday. Maseko reportedly committed suicide at the weekend after accusing her boyfriend of raping her in May this year. Keetse says in most cases students do not even know where to find support at universities. He says some of those offices are hidden. “A student must first look for someone who is going to tell them about someone who knows someone who knows that particular place. In fact in other institutions they don’t have offices that assist our people,” says Keetse. Rhodes University Vice-Chancellor, Dr Sizwe Mabizela says society is continually challenged to be sensitive to patriarchal and cultural norms which lead to sexual and Gender-based violence. Mabizela says men must play a role in changing how women are treated. “Khensani’s death has once again raised our nation’s anger and frustration with a revulsion to this form of women abuse. Her death has forced us to pause and reflect on the kind of society that we have become. There are a number of important lessons for us among others. First, we must pay greater attention to how we raise and socialise a boy child into manhood.” At a gathering held in Makhanda on Tuesday to pay tribute to Maseko, Mabizela stressed the importance of educating young men to respect women and their rights.
