Technical challenges in a new national procurement system have caused delays in the distribution of medication from the Limpopo provincial pharmaceutical depot to some hospitals and clinics. Workers at the depot started using the new system in the beginning of June. Since then some hospitals and clinics, especially in the rural areas, have been experiencing shortages of medication, including for chronic illnesses. Patients at the Knobel Hospital outside Polokwane and surrounding clinics are among the most affected. One of the patient said, “They didn’t give me any medication.  I’m not happy about this because it means I wasted money to come here. They looked at my file and said they didn’t have any medication for my ear infection, and then sent me back to the doctor. I couldn’t get help at Percy clinic so I travelled to Rethabile clinic in Polokwane.”
