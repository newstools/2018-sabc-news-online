Police have confirmed that six people have been arrested after a chief was killed at Mbizana in the Eastern Cape on Sunday. Police are also investigating a case of malicious damage to property. It’s alleged a section of the community of Dindini village went to Chief Thulani Mjanyelwa’s home after holding a meeting and attacked him. Police cluster commander Brigadier Mtutuzeli Mtukushe says the Chief tried to escape but was cornered some 800m from his house before being attacked. He was then set alight. A case of murder and malicious damage to property is being investigated as his house was also vandalised. It is understood that a number of people escaped to a nearby forest. It’s alleged the attack was over the death of two Ncobela brothers in a fire three weeks ago but authorities are linking the Chief’s death to a claim over chieftainship. Brigadier Mtukushe says the death of the two brothers is also under investigation.
