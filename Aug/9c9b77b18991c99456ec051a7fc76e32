Attempts to resolve a leadership dispute between the Minibus Taxi Industry Task Team (MTITT) and the South African National Taxi Council (Santaco) are continuing. The African National Congress (ANC) in the Western Cape earlier initiated the process to facilitate meetings between the parties involved following a one-day strike by taxi operators which left thousands without transport. Santaco has scheduled a regional conference for later this month but the task team is calling for a pre-election conference. ANC MP Cameron Dugmore says the groups met on Friday night but were unable to reach any positive outcomes. He says they have agreed to meet again soon. Watch the video below for related news:
