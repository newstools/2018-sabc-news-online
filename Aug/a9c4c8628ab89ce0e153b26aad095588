Former real estate agent Vicki Momberg, who was convicted and sentenced for her 2016 racist tirade, is expected to apply for bail in the Randburg Magistrates Court, north of Johannesburg on Thursday. This comes after the High Court in Johannesburg on Monday granted her leave to appeal both her conviction and sentence. Momberg has been in jail since she was sentenced to three years imprisonment for crimen injuria in March 2018. One year is suspended. Momberg fell foul of the law for using the k-word at least 48 times against black police officers who tried to help her after she was involved in an alleged smash and grab incident in Northriding, Johannesburg two years ago. She was found guilty by the Randburg Magistrates Court in March and sentenced to an effective two years in jail. The court also rejected her application for leave to appeal her sentence and conviction. She then turned to the High Court in Johannesburg which ruled in her favour on Monday. She is expected to ask the Randburg Magistrates Court to release her on bail, while awaiting the outcome of her appeal.
