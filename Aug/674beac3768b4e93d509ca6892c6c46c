Corruption Watch (CW) has welcomed the Constitutional Court ruling that invalidates former president Jacob Zuma’s appointment of Shaun Abrahams as the National Director of Public Prosecutions. The court found that the manner in which Abraham’s predecessor, Mxolisi Nxasana, was removed from office was unconstitutional and invalid, thus rendering Abrahams’ appointment invalid. The organisation was at the forefront of appealing Abraham’s appointment. The court has given President Cyril Ramaphosa 90 days to appoint a new NPA head. Corruption Watch Executive Director, David Lewis says now it’s time for the NPA to be independent of any political interference. He says it’s up to Ramaphosa to bring stability within the NPA. “What we asked for was granted as it was granted by the High Court and now its confirmed by the Constitutional Court, let’s hope this is the beginning of the renewal of the NPA because for the past ten or more years there has been a chronic instability within the NPA.” “And it was caused by political interference, in the work of the institution, in the work of its director. Let’s hope this brings that to an end.”
