Residents of Mkhondo in Mpumalanga are ecstatic after receiving running water for the first time in many years. Mkhondo Municipality rolled out a bulk water project in the area worth millions of rands. For years rural areas of Mkhondo had no running tap water. Residents made do with the little that they had. “We were drinking with cows and also do our laundry at the same river and we had no toilets so we used the same river as a toilet and at drink from it,” said a resident, Fikelephi Nhlapho. But thanks Mkhondo’s Municipality, this is all about to change. They have initiated a bulk water project so that residents can have clean water. Those who are benefitting from the project have promised to look after the infrastructure. This is phase one of the project, other phases are expected to follow. “Four villages are benefiting from that water so we are expecting that in this financial year will move again with the pipe to other villages,” said Mkhondo Executive Mayor, Vusi Motha. The second phase will include two remaining villages. Pipes have already been installed in the remaining villages.
