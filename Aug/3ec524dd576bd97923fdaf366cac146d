A new R114 million substation has been commissioned to increase electricity generation in Atlantis on the Cape West Coast. The City of Cape Town’s Xanthea Limberg says the substation, built over four years, forms part of plans to spur economic growth and create jobs in the area. She says the facility has the capacity to light up more than 10 million light bulbs. “This new substation also provides a grid connection point for future independent power producers, which is in line with the city’s drive to diversify its energy mix to include renewable energy. “It also provides the backbone for infrastructure, that is essential for fostering economic growth and opportunity.”
