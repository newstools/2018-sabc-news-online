Zimbabwe’s Constitutional Court will on Friday rule on whether to uphold or overturn President Emmerson Mnangagwa’s July 30 election victory, following a challenge by his main rival’s MDC Party. Crowds gathered around screens outside the ConCourt to watch as lawyers representing Mnangagwa and the main opposition leader Nelson Chamisa argued their case before nine judges. Meanwhile, the African Editors Forum has appealed to Zimbabwe’s Broadcasting Corporation to scrap the fees it charges other broadcasters for accessing the current Constitutional Court election challenge. ZBC is charging $13 500 per day for the Television feed and $5 200 for the radio feed. The fee comes amid Zimbabwe’s Judicial Services Commission decision to have exclusive access to the court hearing. TAEF says the fees will deny millions across Africa and the world – including Zimbabweans in the diaspora, to access the information that they have a right to. It urges Zimbabwe’s government, who control the ZBC through the Ministry of Information, to demonstrate the dawn of a new era in Zimbabwe by instructing the leaders of the ZBC to do the right thing and open up the airwaves. For now individuals are streaming the ZBC broadcast on their mobile phones on social media. WATCH RELATED VIDEO:
