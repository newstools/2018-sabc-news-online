The co-author of the controversial book, The Lost Boys of Bird Island, Mark Minnie has been found dead near Port Elizabeth in the Eastern Cape. The body of 58-year-old Minnie, who was a former policeman was found at his friend’s farmhouse in Theescombe on Monday evening. The book details allegations on a pedophile network that included apartheid era Defence Minister Magnus Malan. Police say Minnie had visited his friend’s farm to take a rest away from city life. His friend left him at home and went away with his workers to do farm chores. When he returned in the evening he found Minnie’s body lying near a bush outside his house with a gunshot wound to his head. A firearm was found lying next to him. Police have opened an inquest pending the results of the post mortem.
