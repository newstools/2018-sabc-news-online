Climatologists say parts of South Africa will receive less than average levels of rainfall in the next three months. Showing no signs that the drought will come to an end soon, it’s the farmers in drought-stricken areas that remain the hardest hit. So far, the Northern Cape, Western Cape and Eastern Cape have been declared disaster areas. But in the spirit of the rainbow nation, a group of North West farmers have stepped up, contributing close to R800 million worth of maize to drought stricken areas. For a worthy cause the farmers donated more than 320 tonnes of maize and animal to drought stricken areas in the Eastern and Western Cape. More than ten trucks filled with maize drove down to the Eastern and Western Cape to donate to the affected farmers. However, the weather experts say the country is going through a period of low rainfalls. This is due to global changes in climate conditions Meteorologist Azwitakadzi Tuwani says, “Going forward, we can look at the next season. The rains are low in most areas and to be bearer of bad news, the Eastern Cape is not getting enough rain going into the eastern parts of the Western Cape and the North West. There are some months (which) will be better, but for most we will see less rainfall.” The knock-on effect of the drought is huge dip in staple food production and an increase in prices to consumers. AgriSA Omri Van Zyl says, “The situation is better than it was. We have received some rains in the Western Cape. There are regions that are still very dry like Eastern Cape, Northern Cape and Western Cape and they have dire need of assistance of feed and fodder, but the drought is not at an end.” Areas most affected are the Western Cape. Parts of the Eastern Cape, Northern Cape, Free State and North West are currently faced with drought. Related video click below:
