National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) Chairperson, Sizwe Nxasana has confirmed that he has resigned from the organisation. However he refused to provide any further comment. In a statement, he says he informed Higher Education Minister Naledi Pandor of his resignation on Monday where he offered his support to ensure an orderly handover process. NSFAS has come under fire after Minister Pandor instructed the scheme to halt funding for 2019 students because of a backlog in disbursing aid for 2017 and this year. Nxasana says in the statement that, since December 2016, the institution’s mandate and funding obligations have increased exponentially.
