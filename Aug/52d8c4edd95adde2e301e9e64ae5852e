The leadership battle in the Pan Africanist Congress of Azania (PAC) returns to court on Tuesday to stop the staging of a unity conference scheduled to be held in Kimberly this weekend. Current party president Narius Moloto will argue in the High Court in Johannesburg that those convening the conference are no longer members of the party. Moloto was appointed as president during the party’s elective conference at KwaMhlanga in Mpumalanga in December last year. Moloto has accused disgruntled party members of trying to undermine his authority and waging a campaign to destroy the PAC. “One of their items is to go and dismantle the PAC when they are not even members of the PAC.  That will create confusion and affect us during the national elections.  The leadership of the PAC has the responsibility to protect the party’s legal standing and hence the interdict,” says Moloto.
