Nine new science centres will opened at schools in the Western Cape next week, bringing the total to 66. The Science Learning Centre at the University of the Western Cape says primary and secondary schools in Cape Town, Somerset West, Lambert’s Bay, Clanwilliam and Vredendal will further benefit from the roll-out. Director of the centre, Professor Shaheed Hartley says developing a culture of science teaching and learning is a good start to improving the national senior certificate results and other assessments. “Learners are not able to understand science because they’re not able to see science and to interact, and the idea with the centres it gives the teachers the creative space in which to teach the subject practically and it provides the innovative space for learners to understand and to interact and to be hands-on with the science lessons.”
