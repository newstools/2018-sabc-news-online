Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) National Spokesperson Mbuyiseni Ndlozi has called on all students at institutions of higher learning across the country to support a demand that all Fees Must Fall activists to be pardoned. Ndlozi made the call on Friday night while addressing hundreds of students at the North West University Mafikeng campus. Convicted student activist Bonginkosi Khanyile, who is facing sentencing in October, is staging a sit-in at the Union buildings together with his mother requesting a presidential pardon. Ndlozi says: “The activists of Fees Must Fall are not criminals. If you take them to jail, they are going to come back as criminals because jails are havens of productions of criminals.  So Ramaphosa must drop the charges as Khanyile was marching asking for education. They must drop all the charges and if they don’t, then they are condemning this generation.” Meanwhile, Justice Minister Michael Masutha has promised to assist all students seeking presidential pardon. Masutha says they’ll hold a meeting on Monday morning at the GCIS offices in Hatfield. Watch the video below for related news:
