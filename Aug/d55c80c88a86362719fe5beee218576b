Cape Town police have arrested a suspected member of a syndicate that allegedly defrauds unsuspecting victims through an online dating scam. The Hawks have arrested a 27-year-old man, Tochukwa Christopher Udeh. He has already appeared in the Bellville Magistrateâ€™s Court with his case being postponed to the 27th of this month for a formal bail application. The syndicate reportedly uses fake profiles on their dating site to lure victims. Unsuspecting victims would then be tricked into transferring money to the fraudsters or purchasing gifts. Various laptops, mobile phones, bank cards and shipment documents, including from Australia were seized when the Hawks swooped on premises in Bellville near Cape Town.
