Former ANC MP, Vytjie Mentor, has told the State Capture Inquiry that she was allegedly offered a ministerial position at the Gupta Saxonworld compound, by one of the Gupta brothers, Ajay. Mentor says this was on condition that she agreed to abolish the SAA route to India. The former ANC MP detailed how she was taken to the Gupta brothers home after she was invited by former President Jacob Zuma through then Head of Private office Lakela Kaunda for a meeting. Mentor says she was startled by the offer by the Guptas. Mentor says after she rejected the offer made to her by one of the Gupta brothers to become public enterprises minister, then minister Barbara Hogan was subsequently fired and replaced by minister Malusi Gigaba. Mentor was giving her testimony at the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture in Parktown in Johannesburg. She is expected back on the stand on Tuesday. Mentor says as soon as Gigaba assumed the position back in 2010, the SAA flight route from Johannesburg to Mombai, India was abolished as it had been suggested by Ajay Gupta. Click video below:
