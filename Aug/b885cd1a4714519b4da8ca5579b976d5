The African National Congress (ANC) in Tshwane is holding a night vigil on Wednesday ahead of its motion of no confidence in Tshwane Mayor Solly Msimanga.  Msimanga will face two motions of no confidence against him on Thursday, the other coming from the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF). The ANC’s motion of no confidence in Msimanga relates to a tender fraud allegedly involving City Manager, Moeketsi Mosola and engineering consultancy firm GladAfrica. The EFF on the other hand accuses Msimanga of not consulting with other parties in the crucial running of the city and giving jobs to people without necessary qualifications. Meanwhile, the Democratic Alliance (DA) has vowed to support Msimanga. Speaking after the DA’s Federal Executive meeting in Johannesburg on Wednesday, party leader Mmusi Maimane says any attempt to remove Msimanga is an assault on the people of South Africa. He adds that South Africans will have to choose between what he calls a coalition of corruption, and clean governance. Maimane has also disputed allegations against Msimanga.
