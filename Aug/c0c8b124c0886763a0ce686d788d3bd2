A 36-year-old man has been shot and killed in an apparent gang related shooting in Bonteheuwel on the Cape Flats. The police have confirmed that they are investigating the incident. Ward councillor Angus McKenzie says they have had several shooting incidents in the area in the past two weeks. He says he fears for the lives of innocent bystanders who may get caught in the crossfire. McKenzie says they simply do no have enough police resources to curb the problem. He says: “We have had ongoing shootings every single day for the last two weeks. The issue is we don’t have enough policemen. The police that we do have are not properly resourced. Bonteheuwel is a community of 85 000 people but we don’t have our own fully functional police station.”
