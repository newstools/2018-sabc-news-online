The High Court in Pretoria will on Monday morning hand down sentencing in the case of two North West women convicted of murdering a grade 12 learner three years ago. Twenty three-year-old Cynthia Mosupi and co-accused Sharon Twala of Maboloka were found guilty of the murder and kidnapping of Boitumelo Ndlovu; a learner at Eletsa Secondary School in Letlhabile near Brits. During the trial, the court heard that Mosupi and Twala doused Ndlovu with petrol and set her alight near Madidi north of Pretoria in June 2015. The attack was over a boyfriend.
