A 19-year-old double murder suspect, who is accused of strangling two school girls at Hoërskool Stella in the North West, is expected to appear in the Vryburg Magistrate’s Court on Monday morning. Xander Bylsma is believed to be an ex-boyfriend of one of the deceased. Bylsma stands accused of killing Sharnelle Hough and Marna Engelbrecht in May this year. He allegedly sneaked inside at the girl’s hostel where he is said to have committed these murders, before making it look like a suicide. He was arrested the same day. The body of one of the girls was found hanging from a staircase balustrade while the other one was found in a bathroom in the school’s hostel. The incident sent shockwaves around the country, with Minister Angie Motshekga calling for justice. Bylsma has been in custody since and abandoned his bail application earlier, fearing for his life after allegedly making a confession to the police. There were also reports of a vigilante group, that wanted to take revenge.
