The Southern African Development Community (SADC) urged Lesotho to implement its reforms roadmap. It called on the mountain-locked Kingdom to implement this without any further delay. It’s been a long journey to resolve the impasse in Lesotho. It followed the attempted coup’ in 2014 and now SADC is losing patience. It noted that despite a number of its initiatives progress on the implementation of the reforms roadmap and national dialogue remains slow. President Cyril Ramaphosa says: “We will not tolerate any of the role players trying to delay, derail or  frustrate the holding of the national dialogue.” Member states have been called upon to take any necessary measures to those who are threatening to delay the reforms. SADC called on all stake holders to demonstrate political will to implement the reforms. The summit congratulated member states that held elections since the last summit and commended President Joseph Kabila for upholding the constitution by providing funding to enable peaceful elections. On peace and security, the regional block committed itself to maintaining peace and called on all member states to allow democracy to reign. New SADC chair and President of Namibia Hage Geingob said people should experience change and that SADC initiatives should produce tangible results. Meanwhile, the body called for continued consultations in relation to the ongoing institutional reforms of the Africa Union. Tanzania will host the next SADC summit next year.
