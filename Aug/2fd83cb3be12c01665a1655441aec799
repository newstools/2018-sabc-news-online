Parliament’s Portfolio Committee on Police has called for an urgent investigation into the Hawks. This follows former Deputy Finance Minister Mcebisi Jonas’ allegations during his testimony at the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture on the conduct of high-ranking officials in the Hawks. Jonas dropped a bombshell when he revealed that the Hawks attempted to deliberately sabotage the investigation into the Guptas‘ alleged attempt to bribe him. The committee says it has noted with serious concern allegations made against Hawks top brass on investigating allegations of State Capture. Committee Chairperson Francois Beukman says they believe that any allegations against Hawks members should be urgently investigated despite the Commission still being underway, and that Jonas’ testimony will still be cross examined. He is requesting the Head of the Hawks General Godfrey Lebeya to launch an internal inquiry into these allegations. Click below for more on the story:
