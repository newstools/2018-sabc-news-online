Advocate Dumisa Ntsebeza SC, who was assigned by the former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan to investigate the conflict in Darfur, remembers the great diplomat. Ntsebeza has praised the former United Nations Chief Kofi Annan for being a humble and peaceful leader. Ntsebeza was appointed by Annan in the mid 2000s to be one of five commissioners to investigate reports of violations of international human rights and humanitarian law in Darfur, in Sudan. The findings of the investigation prompted the International Criminal Court to charge Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir for war crimes and crimes against humanity. Ntsebeza says the world looked up to Annan for guidance in resolving conflict. “What struck me with him was the humility. The UN Secretary General, sitting across a man who was persuading me to accept a position that I believe changed the course of what happened in Dafur. There are still countries who look up to him when they have got issues that need diplomacy, that need a person of stature who will deal in a manner that will bring people closer to peace.” Annan died in Switzerland on Saturday. The 80-year old international diplomat is said to succumbed to a short illness. Annan was the UN Secretary-General between 1997 to 2006. He was also a chair of the group of elders set up by former President Nelson Mandela. Ntsebeza spoke to SABC News Foreign Editor Sophie Mokoena. For more watch video below:
