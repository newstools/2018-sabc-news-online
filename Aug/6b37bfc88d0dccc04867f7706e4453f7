A police officer has been wounded following a shootout between police and about four suspects in Freedom Park, Soweto. The shootout ensued when the officers approached a suspicious looking vehicle following a tip-off from members of the public. Police recovered an AK47 and a pistol, but the suspects managed to flee. Gauteng Police Spokesperson Kay Makhubele says the wounded officer is in a stable condition in hospital. “The police are intensifying operation Buya Mthetho as we make sure that the information that’s coming to light is executed as soon as possible. We’re calling on people who know these suspects to call the police. They must not try to apprehend them. A case of attempted murder is opened.” Meanwhile, Gauteng police are looking for an unknown man who shot and killed two people at a Midrand restaurant, north of Johannesburg in the early hours of Sunday morning. It’s understood the suspect was involved in a scuffle with the two men before he opened fire on them. Spokesperson Makhubele says that it’s alleged they had an argument with the deceased. “We understand that he drove off in a BMW with an unknown registration number. We’re calling on anyone with the information to call the police so that we can arrest the suspect.”
