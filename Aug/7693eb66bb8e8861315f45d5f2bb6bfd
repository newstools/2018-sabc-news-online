Home affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba says during his tenure as Finance Minister, he called for a commission of inquiry into South African Reserve Service (SARS). Gigaba says the inquiry was to repair the strained relationship between SARS and Treasury, as well as between the Finance Minister and the SARS Commissioner. He served as Finance Minister from 31 March 2017 until 27 February 2018. Gigaba was giving oral at the SARS commission of inquiry into governance and tax administration at SARS currently underway in Pretoria. “Prior to my appointment as Minister of Finance, and to some extent even during my tenure as Minister of Finance, I had not had a good relationship, particularly with the National Treasury. We needed to address those issues, particularly issues of governance, of relations between the institutions and the National treasury, the relation between the Commissioner and the Minister of finance and the triangular relation between the President, the Minister and the Commissioner of the South African Revenue service.” Click link for more:
