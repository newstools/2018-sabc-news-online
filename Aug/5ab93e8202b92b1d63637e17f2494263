The United National Transport Union (UNTU) says Gautrain management has gone to court to interdict striking workers. The union says it will continue with the strike until management agrees to return to the negotiating table. It says at this stage, 350 workers are on strikeÂ and 90% of those are train operators. Gautrain has been running limited services as a result of the strike. UNTU General Secretary Steve Harris says they have also written to management requesting financial statements.
