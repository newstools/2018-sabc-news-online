Foreign shop owners operating in KwaMashu, Inanda, Ntuzuma and aMawoti north of Durban are reeling with fear after their shops were looted on Thursday night. CCTV footage from one of the affected shops shows a group of people driving in more than 10 bakkies and parking next to the shop. The group then forces entry into the shop and loots all food items loading them in their bakkies before moving to the next shop. Shop owner Ali Asama says he is traumatised. “There were different cars and some where bakkies with a lot of ladies and men. We know some of them from stakeholder meetings. They came with petrol bombs and they forced themselves inside. They had firearms.” Shop owner Mekuria Matthews whose car was burnt, says he is devastated by the incident. “This is not good. It’s very bad. They started hitting my car and they burnt my car. I didn’t do anything wrong. I came here in South Africa for a better life but this is wrong. They must stop this.”
