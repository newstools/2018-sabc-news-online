Political analyst Ralph Mathekga has warned that the electorate will punish political parties at the polls if they continue to disrupt service delivery by collapsing local goverment. His warning comes after the removal of the DA’s Nelson Mandela Bay Metro mayor Athol Trollip on Monday through a vote of no confidence. Meanwhile, the EFF, which voted for the DA-led coalition in Tshwane after the 2016 local elections, wants mayor Solly Msimanga to be removed citing alleged corruption in a R12 billion contract. Mathekga says political parties are not considering the needs of those who voted for them. He says what is missing in the entire situation is the voice of voters. “Voters go to vote but I think that we are going to get to a point where they retain a very strong voice to a point where they will actually influence the behaviour of political leaders. At this point, the behaviour of political leaders and the conflicts they engage in is about power,” says Mathekga.
