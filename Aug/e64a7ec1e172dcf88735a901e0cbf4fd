Police have vowed to hunt down four suspects who allegedly killed one person during an attack on the Ngangelizwe Police Station in Mthatha in the Eastern Cape. It is alleged that they held members of the police who were on duty at gunpoint in the early hours of Monday morning before shooting dead a 38-year-old man who was in police holding cells. He was allegedly arrested for the possession of illegal firearms. “It is alleged that four suspects in possession of firearms entered the Community Service Centre just after midnight and held members on duty at gun point. Two of the suspects proceeded to the holding cells and the members heard several gunshots. The suspects fled the scene. Upon investigation, it was found that a person who was in custody, a 38-year-old male, was fatally shot. The motive at this stage has not yet been established, but the National Commissioner has instructed that a 72 hour action plan be activated so that a multi-disciplinary team is convened and investigates what really transpired,” says Police spokesperson Colonel Brenda Muridili.
