Four of the people who were killed in the crash in Mpumalanga on Friday morning are learners. Mpumalanga’s Department of Community Safety has confirmed that the learners were on their way to school when the head on collision between a bus and a taxi at KaMdladla near Tonga in Nkomazi occurred. The department says five people were killed, not six as some reports have said. The Department’s spokesperson Joseph Mabuza says the fifth person was the taxi driver, who died on his way to hospital. <a href="https://iono.fm/e/598314">Content hosted by iono.fm</a>
