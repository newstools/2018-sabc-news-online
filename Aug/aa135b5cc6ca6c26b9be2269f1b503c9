The KwaZakhele Day Hospital in Port Elizabeth has been re-opened after being closed for almost a week by the residents following a spate of robberies on the premises. At the beginning of the year, staff members and patients were robbed at gunpoint by two suspects pretending to be patients. Two security guards were also robbed last month. Following meetings between the residents, health district officials and the police, it was decided to re-open the clinic. Xolani Sandlana is the Committee Clinic Chairperson says: “The demand from the community was that they should bring more security which they did this morning. They brought the additional security which was removed. And then the panic button we requested for, they will get it from another facility which had a similar incident. So they will organise two of those panic buttons and then the other issues will be dealt with between the month of September and October.” Health spokesperson Lwandile Sicwetsha says they will be collaborating with the police to ensure the safety of patients. “We have agreed on everything that SAPS will be supporting and patrolling around that area and our security system will also be linked out with the nearest police station.”
