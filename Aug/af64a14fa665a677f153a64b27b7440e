Johannesburg police have arrested a suspect in the murder of late ANC Member of Parliament, Sibusiso Radebe. Radebe was shot and killed in Roodepoort in June this year. The 31-year old male has been arrested in Braamfisherville, Soweto. Police spokesperson Mathapelo Peters says the man has also been linked to a series of other crimes in the west of Johannesburg, including carjackings and house-robberies. The suspect will appear before the Roodepoort Magistrates court Wednesday morning. Gauteng commissioner of police Deliwe De lange has urged investigating teams to ensure that the three remaining suspects are apprehended soon. She says: ‘They must make sure they are caught and brought to book.”
