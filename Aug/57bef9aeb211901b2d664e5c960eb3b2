Nehawu (National Education Health and Allied Workers’ Union) and various health union members including Denosa (Democratic Nursing Organisation of South Africa) and PSA (Public Servants Association) have shutdown the Kagiso District Health facility in Kuruman in the Northern Cape. The shutdown has affected the rendering of health services at the Tshwaragano and Kuruman hospitals, which report directly to the district facility. The members say they have raised their concerns of staff shortages at clinics and hospitals in the John Taolo Gaetsewe district, but their complaints have fallen on deaf ears. Nehawu Regional Secretary Banzi Sebotse says the shutdown will continue until their demands are met. “We met this morning to actually show the management or the province that we are not actually happy with what is happening regarding the staff shortage. We tried by all means to escalate the matter to the HOD and the MEC but we are not being assisted. That is why we said today we shut down until they come down to us to address these issues and try to resolve them”.
