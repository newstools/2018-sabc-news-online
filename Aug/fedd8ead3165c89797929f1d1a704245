Inkosi Freedom Party leader, Mangosuthu Buthelezi has urged people to vote for a leadership that will tackle widespread corruption in the private and public sectors. This comes after Corruption Watch released a report this week, detailing that bribery‚ embezzlement, procurement irregularities and stolen resources were the most common forms of corruption for the first half of this year. The majority of the complaints relate to corruption in the health sector, schools, municipalities‚ licensing centres‚ police and SOEs. Addressing the IFP’s Women’s Day rally in Ngwelezane, near Empangeni in KwaZulu-Natal he said people should use the 2019 elections to vote for a party that will lead with integrity. “We may have a new president at present, but the rot is still eating away. It needs to be stopped. Who must stop it? Us, you and me. In less than a year we will have a national and provincial election, all of us will have a chance to stop the rot by voting against corruption. We need to empower a different leadership, a leadership of integrity.” Watch for more:
