DA leader Mmusi Maimane has described the ousting of Athol Trollip as mayor of the Nelson Mandela Bay in Port Elizabeth as a mockery of democracy. Maimane addressed the media in Cape Town. He says the new coalition of the UDM and ANC that ousted Trollip is undemocratic. Trollip was ousted in absentia in a vote of no confidence and replaced by Bobani Mongameli. Maimane says the act undermines clean governance and the new coalition is unconstitutional. He says the DA will take it on legal review “After having consulted with our legal team, we have taken a resolute decision to say that the council decision to remove Athol Trollip as Executive Mayor, we will be taking that on legal review.” “We are of the opinion that the sitting was procedurally invalid and lacked legit authority to elect a new speaker and then subsequently to pass a motion of no confidence in the Mayor,” says Maimane.
