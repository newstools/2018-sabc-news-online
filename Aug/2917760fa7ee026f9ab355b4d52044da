Three suspects are expected to appear in court soon after they were bust in connection with a drug manufacturing lab. National Police Commissioner Khehla Sitole made the announcement at the crime scene in Erasmia, west of Pretoria, on Monday morning. This is the second drug bust in two weeks. The first was in Harding in KwaZulu-Natal where drugs were also discovered in a secluded farm. Sitole says the three suspects were caught red-handed and two of them have been linked to other crimes. He says: “With regard to the value, I cannot say at the present moment because investigations are still on. This is still a crime scene and the crime scene analysts and investigators are still here.” “Regarding other cases, two of the three men were involved in other cases. One was involved in armed robbery and the other has another drug related charge,” adds Sitole.
