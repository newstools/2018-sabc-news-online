Tempers have flared up in the Constitutional Review Committee between Congress of the People (COPE), the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) and the African National Congress (ANC), as members are deliberating on a preliminary report on the written submissions made to amend Section 25 of the Constitution to allow for land expropriation without compensation.
