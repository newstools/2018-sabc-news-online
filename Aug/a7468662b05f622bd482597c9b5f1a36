Tributes continue to pour in following the death of anti-apartheid activist, Zondeni Sobukwe. The widow of the Pan Africanist Congress of Azania (PAC) founding President Robert Sobukwe died on Wednesday morning at the age of 91. PAC Member of Parliament, Luthando Mbinda, says Mama Sobukwe has left an indelible mark on South Africa’s political landscape. “We won’t mourn her death but will celebrate that Mama Sobukwe has lived. We want to support her family. We are saying her soul must rest in peace, we know that Mama Sobukwe endured a lot of pain at the time when former President Sobukwe was harassed by the racist apartheid regime. She was always telling us about the unity of the PAC.” Mbinda says memorial services will be held across the country next week. She will be laid to rest on the 25th of August in Graaf Reinet. On the 22nd of August all provincial structures of the PAC will be having their memorial services. Click video below:
