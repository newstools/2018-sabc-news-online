Traditional leaders have lambasted the commercialisation of initiation schools as the main cause of botched circumcisions. They were speaking at a public hearing on the proposed Customary Initiation Bill conducted by Parliament’s Portfolio Committee on Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs at Apel in Limpopo. The Bill seeks to improve ways in which circumcisions at initiation schools are administered. The Portfolio Committee is looking at the causes of botched circumcisions and the deaths of initiates. Limpopo has reported many cases of abduction and illegal schools over the years. Portfolio Committee’s Richard Mdakane says the Bill seeks to achieve the regulations of customary initiations because of the challenges experienced and also to clarify the roles and responsibilities of various stakeholders and set oversight committee. Traditional leaders welcome the proposed Bill, but say legislation needs to be amended. Contralesa’s Kgoshi Letsiri says commercialising it has created a problem and has attracted negative publicity around the practice. He adds that intervals should be introduced to the practicing of the initiation schools. Traditional leaders propose that initiation schools be held every four years.
