Phola township residents in Mpumalanga were shocked to learn that their protest action led to a delay in receiving services. The community took to the streets last week demanding houses, electricity and water. Government infrastructure was damaged when the protest turned violent. Mpumalanga Premier Refilwe Mtshweni says this has led to a six week delay in providing power, but has assured the community that water will be coming from their taps from September 1st. The community says if ward councillors had done their jobs in the first place, the protest could’ve been averted. “There is a matter that they raised about the councillors that they are not convening the meetings … There are ward committees which get paid and councillors get paid and one of their functions is to convene a community meeting at least once a month,” said Mpumalanga MEC of CoGCTA, Speedy Mashilo. The community is satisfied after meeting with government. “What makes us happy now is that the war is over and no more vandalizing because the community was angry,” said community leader, Edward Mahlangu. The premier promises to monitor progress in delivering services. Watch related video below:
