A sinkhole which forced a road closure in Tshwane 15 months ago has been repaired at a cost of R5 million. The section of the road in Centurion has been opened to traffic. Businesses had shut down and some even lost their jobs at the complex. Business owner Esme Janse Van Rensburg says:”After 15-16 months it caught up to us. So we are at the cross roads and we can only hope that with the opening of the sinkhole, people will realise that the center is still there, come and visit us.” Businesses took Tshwane metro to court to fast track the project. The metro was forced to race against time to repair the sinkhole. Tshwane Mayor Solly Msimanga has undertaken to ensure the remaining portion of Jean Avenue opens within the next month.
