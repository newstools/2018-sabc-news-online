United States President Donald Trump plans to appoint a retired senior Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) analyst with expertise in Africa as the spy agency’s new deputy director, the White House said on Wednesday. Trump, who has repeatedly questioned a US intelligence assessment that Russia conducted an influence operation to swing the 2016 election in his favour, will tap Vaughn Bishop to be the agency’s second-in-command to CIA Director Gina Haspel, the announcement said. Bishop is an Indiana native who retired from the agency in 2011 following a 30-year career in which he rose to senior positions. These included the top intelligence analyst for Africa and the vice chairman of the National Intelligence Council, which produces top-secret assessments for the president. After his retirement, Bishop worked as a consultant on a CIA reorganization initiative. With Bishop’s appointment, the agency would be led by a career officer from its clandestine service – Haspel and a career officer from its analytical branch.
