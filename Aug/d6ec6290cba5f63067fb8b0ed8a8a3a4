The EFF in the North West has welcomed a decision of the provincial executive council led by Premier Job Mokgoro to reverse all the programmes that his predecessor Supra Mahumapelo had adopted. These programmes include the Setsokotsane, Village Township and Small Dorpies, Rebranding and Renewal. According to Mahumapelo, the programmes were in line with the National Development Plan. Mokgoro’s administration believes that is not true. The EFF provincial leader, Betty Diale says the programmes were meant to loot state funds. “As the EFF we feel that the reversal of the so called five concretes in the North West is a step in the right direction. We have seen a waste of tax payers’ money by those programmes Supra Mahumapelo had adopted. They did not do anything for the people of North West”. She adds that the amount of R10 million was taken from each department annually for programmes that did not benefit the people of North West. However, political analyst Professor Andre Duvenhage believes that Mokgoro’s actions show his plans to take total control of the provincial government. “By reversing these ideological projects of Supra Mahumapelo, it is a clear indication that the new government is taking control of the province. I have no doubt that Mr Job Mokgoro is doing it strategically to limit the support base of Supra Mahumapelo because clearly, there are still two centres of power and there is a strong competition between these centres of power”.
