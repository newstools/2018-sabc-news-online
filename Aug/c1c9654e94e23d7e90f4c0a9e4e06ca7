The Kouga Municipality in the Eastern Cape says the water crisisÂ is continuing to worsen as the municipality has only ten weeks of water left. Water levels at the Kouga Dam have significantly decreased following severe drought in the area. Tough water restrictions have been implemented to conserve the resource. Kouga Municipality Mayor Horatio Hendricks says the municipality will conduct a water drive to curb the crisis. Hendricks says water will be cut from 04:30 until 08:00 and again from 16:00 until 20:00. On Wednesdays and Saturdays, morning cuts will be extended to 11:00. Hendricks adds that water tanks will be sent out to communities. Watch the video below for related news:
