The African National Congress (ANC) has condemned the assassination attempt on Venezuela President Nicolas Maduro. Two drones loaded with explosives reportedly went off in front of the podium as Maduro was delivering a speech at the 81st anniversary of the military. Seven soldiers were injured. The ANC says barbaric acts have no place in the democratic and peace-loving world. The ANC is calling the attack an attempt by regime change agents and imperialist forces who do not want to respect the independence of Venezuela and their democratically elected government. It says it is clear that some are against the countryâ€™s recently announced measures for economic recovery that are intended to bring stability, tranquility and prosperity. The ANC urges Venezuela to investigate the attacks and bring all involved to book.
