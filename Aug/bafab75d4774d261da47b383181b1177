A lack of information and exposure to scarce skills fields is one of the major reasons young people in disadvantaged areas are not entering these careers. The iCebolethu Foundation hosted a three day 100 scarce skills exhibition for 15 000 grade 9 learners in the Ethekwini region at the Durban Exhibition centre. Icebolethu CEO Nomfundo Mcoyi says this project aims to eliminate unemployment by showing learners that there are endless possibilities within skills and education. “Learners will learn to see that there are so many careers that they can do, except the normal ones that are so abundant in SA… Here we’re only looking at the skills that are so scarce, especially the artisans, and we also showing the learners that FET and TVET colleges they are very important for them they mustn’t take them for granted. I think the Department of Education must start supporting initiatives such as this one because that’s the only way of showing learners what is there.”
