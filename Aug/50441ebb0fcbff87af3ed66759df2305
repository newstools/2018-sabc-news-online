The Academic Professional Staff Association (APSA) accuses Minister Nzimande of using his position while he was Higher Education Minister to appoint friends, cronies and relatives to head influential entities. APSA’s general-secretary Professor Boitumelo Senokoane says: “We have approached the department of education and we’ve complaint about the issues that we’ve raised. We have all written to the minister on the issues that we have raised.” “But above that based on the information that is coming in, we are ready ourselves to approach the relevant bodies. So that if need be we open up criminal charges so that we make sure this issue is attended,” says Senokoane. Nzimande has rejected allegations by APSA which they want to use as the basis of charges against him. He says the association’s statement is anchored in perceptions, abundant false allegations and conclusions. He says he has done nothing as a Minister that, as far as he is aware, has violated any of the laws and procedures in government or the constitution.
