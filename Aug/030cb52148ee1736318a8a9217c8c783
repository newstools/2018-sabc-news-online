Health Ombudsman Professor Malegapuru Makgoba has lambasted the media for damaging the reputation of the country by running false stories about the Tower Psychiatric Hospital in the Eastern Cape. In a report released on Thursday, Makgoba rejected comparisons of the situation at the Tower hospital with the Life Esidimeni scandal in Gauteng. He found that the main complainant in the matter, Doctor Kiran Sukeri, had lied and misrepresented facts in media reports about the mental facility. Makgoba also had strong words for the media, “I just again want to urge the media, they got it wrong on this matter, wrong. And the signs of it are so clear and so precise that you are not going to get away. When your star witness tells you I’m wrong and you have based your information on that star witness I think you must sit with the star witness and say let’s talk together. You don’t come here and be defensive because you are not always right. I’m doing this in the interest of the nation that has been damaged by peddling false and untruthful information.” Click for more
