The two-week long strike by Gautrain employees is officially over. The United National Transport union, under the umbrella of Fedusa says it has received a mandate from workers to accept an 8% salary increase, a minimum wage of R8,500 and R900 housing allowance. This is after the striking Gautrain workers have rejected a new three-year wage deal offered by the Bombela Operating Company. UNTU Deputy General Secretary Pieter Greyling says, “We welcome the fact that we could reach an agreement after marathon interventions. You can see that our constituents are very happy with what we have managed to reach. When you negotiate you would like to reach a better conclusion. But I think under the circumstances where commuters have been put in a bad situation, we ended the strike.” Workers affiliated to the United National Transport Union (UNTU) were demanding a wage increase of 10%, while the employer was offering 8.5%.
