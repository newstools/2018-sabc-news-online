The Kaserne Bridge on the M2 freeway in Johannesburg is being closed off until the end of 2019 due to major cracks. Thousands of motorists will be affected from Monday.  The motorway is a critical route in the Johannesburg road network and authorities have advised motorists to use alternative routes. Johannesburg Metro Police spokesperson Wayne Minnaar explains: “There are huge cracks underneath the bridge, which places motorists at a serious risk if they use it, seeing as the bridge is almost 50 years old, so the repairs have to be done. The M2 east has now been blocked off between the Joe Slovo off-ramp and Maritzburg road. This means that only use alternative routes to get past the area which is going to be worked on.” WATCH BELOW:
