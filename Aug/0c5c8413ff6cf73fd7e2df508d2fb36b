The Democratic Alliance (DA) is calling on National Police Commissioner General Khehla Sitole to release the latest quarterly reports of all crimes when he appears in Parliament this week. On Wednesday, Sitole is expected to brief the oversight committee on police on crimes against women and children. However, the DA says that is not enough as the release of quarterly reports is long overdue. The partyâ€™s spokesperson on Police Zakhele Mbhele says the last time they received quarterly reports was in 2017 during the release of the annual crime statistics. He says that the South African Police Service is either purposely attempting to postpone or avoid the release of quarterly crime reports.
