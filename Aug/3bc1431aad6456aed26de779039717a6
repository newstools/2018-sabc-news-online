A strong police contingency has been deployed to Ikageng township in Potchefstroom in the North West.Â This comes after community members threatened to blockade roads ahead of a planned march. The community is planning to hand over a memorandum of demands related to service delivery to the JB Marks Local Municipality. Community members marched to the local high school in Ikageng and failed in their attempt to lobby learners to be part of the march due to police reaction. The marchers are expected to converge at the local stadium before heading to the Local Municipality offices. Their concerns are over service delivery issues, which includes sanitation and electricity. They are also calling for the recall of the JB Marks Local Municipality Mayor Kgotso Khumalo accusing him and the council for failing to account to the R12 million budget set to upgrade sanitation infrastructure. Last month DA Shadow Minister for Water and Sanitation Leon Basson visited the area in attempts to address the extensive sewage leaks in the area.
