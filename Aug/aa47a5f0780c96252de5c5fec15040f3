The latest report by Corruption Watch shows that procurement irregularities have increased significantly in municipalities and state-owned enterprises. The second edition of the Analysis of Corruption Trends (ACT) report indicates that procurement loopholes account for just below 45 per cent of the report, compared with 18 per cent in last year’s report. The report found that businesses are increasingly engaging in corrupt behaviour to secure government contracts. Melusi Ncala is a researcher at Corruption Watch and author of the report, “These are procurement issues that largely pertain to our reporter highlighting how businesses are more than willing to pay bribes in the form of kickbacks to officials within municipalities so that they can secure tenders. It’s always a problem when we have businesses that seek to circumvent the laws of the country just to benefit themselves.”
