Former Northern Cape African National Congress (ANC) Chairperson, John Block and Trifecta Investments CEO Christo Scholtz, will on Monday apply for their bail to be extended. Last week, the Supreme Court of Appeal in Bloemfontein dismissed the appeal by Block and Scholtz after their 15-year jail sentence. The duo were found guilty on fraud and corruption. The Supreme Court of Appeal did not make an order when the two should hand themselves over to the Tshwelopele Correctional Facility in Kimberley. They want to head to the Constitutional Court in a bid to appeal their sentence again. The National Prosecuting Authorityâ€™s (NPA) Phaladi Shuping says the two notified the registrar of the High Court in the Northern Cape that they will be bringing an application for bail while they are still trying to start the process to appeal against their case in the Constitutional Court.
