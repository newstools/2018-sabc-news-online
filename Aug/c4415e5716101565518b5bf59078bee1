Land expropriation without compensation must continue without any fears in South Africa. That’s the view from the African National Congress (ANC). Deputy Secretary General, Jessie Duarte says amending the Constitution to allow for land expropriation without compensation should also be sensitive to addressing historical injustices. Duarte briefed the media on the party’s National Working Committee (NWC) meeting on Monday. She said the ANC would continue to engage relevant stakeholders on the land issue; these will include traditional leaders, rural communities, farmers and farmworkers. The ANC is adamant that land will be handed back to its rightful owners. A meeting of the party’s NWC has called upon members of parliament to make sure that amendments to Section 25 of the Constitution are speedily implemented. This amid fears of economic instability and threat to food security but the ruling party says land gives a sense of identity to all citizens. Duarte says: “Although the constitution does not preclude expropriation without compensation, it should be amended to make this matter explicit. We reiterate the ANC’s position that any changes to the Constitution and its effect on expropriation without compensation will be done in a manner that is in line with and with respect to the rule of law.” Click video below: Duarte has disputed media reports suggesting that land expropriation without compensation is an election issue. She says parliamentary processes will take place and in due course the suggested amendments on Section 25 of the Constitution will come into effect.
