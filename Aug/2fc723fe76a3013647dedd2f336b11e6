Communications Minister Nomvula Mokonyane and the SABC are expected before the Communications Committee in Parliament on Tuesday. Parliament is back in full swing with various committees and plenaries scheduled for this week. The Minister and the SABC Board are expected to brief the committee about the corporation’s turnaround strategy, sports rights and the non-payment of independent producers. They are also expected to give a response to the concerns raised with the committee by various unions that are organising in the SABC. In the Energy Committee, Minister Jeff Radebe and his department will brief the committee about the government’s plans to ease the burden of high fuel prices on consumers. Radebe has been forced to appear before the Energy Committee after the ministry and the department failed to turn up for a scheduled meeting on the fuel crisis last week. The minister was out of the country, but neither his deputy nor his department turned up for the scheduled meeting.
