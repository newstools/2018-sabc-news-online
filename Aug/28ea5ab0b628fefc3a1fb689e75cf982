Social Development Minister Susan Shabangu says she is aware that Cash Payment Services (CPS) is continuing to issue illegal green cards to social grant beneficiaries. Shabangu has addressed beneficiaries in the Burgersfort area of Limpopo where South Africa Social Security Agency (SASSA) officials are assisting them to change to the new card. Shabangu has urged those still using the green card as well as the old SASSA card, to replace them before the Post Office takes over payment of social grants. “The purpose is to make sure that we do the card swap and meet the deadline of the Constitutional Court which is end of September. So today I’m here to observe whether the right thing is happening because I got complaints about grinrod CPS who continue to give our beneficiaries the green card. So I’m here to make sure that they understand why they have to change the old card of SASSA, including the green card and move into the new card which is going to pay through the post office.”
