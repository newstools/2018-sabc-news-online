Newly announced Loeries chairperson Tseliso Rangaka  says the multi-billion dollar brand communication industry still needs to undergo transformation. Rangaka was speaking during the Loeries awards ceremony in Durban on Saturday. The Loeries is the most prestigious brand communication awards for the industry. The Loeries awards are a week long creative event, which costed over R100 million to put together and organisers have gone bigger and better this year. Despite the glitz and glamour, critics believe the industry has failed to adhere to calls of transformation. “That is a very important thing for me being a black person myself. I think we’ve been looking at the wrong places. The other thing that we can do is obviously challenge our clients to demand that from our agencies more and  more. We are seeing that happening with a lot of them but I think there needs to be a concerted effort,” says Rangaka. The night belonged to TBWA Hunt Lascaris for their “Joburg Ballet” advertisement. South African brand communication company “Joe Public United” scooped  the agency of the year award for their “Sbu 2.0 Chicken Licken” advert. Whilst renowned film director Greg Gray was inducted into the Loeries Hall of fame.
