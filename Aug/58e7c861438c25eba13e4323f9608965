The African Independent Congress (AIC) says it gives the African national Congress (ANC) a month to meet its coalition agreements or else they will withdraw their partnership at Ekurhuleni Metro in the Gauteng province. One of the AICâ€™s demand is for the administration of Matatiele to be moved from the Eastern Cape to KwaZulu-Natal. The AIC is making its voice heard on the issues of governance affecting them. At Nelson Mandela Bay they reaffirmed their stance of working together with opposition parties to oust Democratic Alliance (DA) led metro in a motion of no confidence against Mayor Athol Trollip. Mahlubi Jafta the AIC General Secretary says their main target is the DA, not just Trollip because DA policies are not favourable to the needs of the people. The AIC has also threatened to withdraw its coalition agreements with the ANC at Ekurhuleni Metro, should the ruling party fail to meet its coalition demands within the next 30 days. At the top of their demands is the removal of Matatiele to KZN. The issue of moving Matatiele back to KZN has been a tropical issue for years now. However it remains a political issue between the AIC and the ANC. Matatiele was moved from KZN to the EC in 2005, and since then attempts to move its administration back to KZN have yielded no positive results. WATCH BELOW:
