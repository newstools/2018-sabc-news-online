President Cyril Ramaphosa address to the Stakeholder Consultative Meeting on the National Health Insurance (NHI) scheme, with a particular focus on the recently gazetted National Health Insurance Bill and the Medical Schemes Amendment Bill. The NHI represents a substantial policy shift that will restructure healthcare and secure universal health coverage for all South Africans. The NHI is a financing system that will make sure that all citizens of South Africa (and legal long-term residents) are provided with access to comprehensive healthcare, regardless of their employment status and ability to make a direct monetary contribution to the NHI Fund. – www.gov.za
