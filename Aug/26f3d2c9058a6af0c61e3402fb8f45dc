Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) members in the KwaZulu-Natal Legislature say the best 90th birthday gift for the party leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi would be an unreserved apology from those who have attempted to distort his legacy. A series of celebrations in honour of the veteran leader will be held, starting on his actual birthday on Monday. Their call for an apology was made at a media briefing in Ulundi in northern KwaZulu-Natal on Friday. Mayor Wilson Ntshangase says people from some political quarters have vilified and tried to erase Buthelezi’s contribution to the country’s history. “The prince wants the new generation to clearly know his role in history. Most youngsters do not have the correct history because it has been distorted. The prince has been a good leader and made sure that the lives of others changed for the better. So it’s important that the prince’s history be corrected and his good role be known. South Africans should ensure that they do good things in order to honour and show their appreciation of what the he has done for the country. I think the gift that people should award the prince is to make sure they vote for the IFP so it’s in power. The prince has achieved so much.” Ntshangase called on South Africans to do good, show respect and fight corruption in honour of Buthelezi. He also announced that the Ulundi Sports Stadium will be renamed after the long term party leader due to the role he played in bringing about change in the lives of the poor. Ntshangase says more than 15 000 local and international visitors are expected to descend to Ulundi on Monday for the celebrations. Watch the video below for related news:
