The death toll from Saturday’s bus crash on the R66 between Melmoth and Eshowe in KwaZulu-Natal has risen to six. Clothes, food and pieces of the wreckage remain scattered on the spot. The victims, who are from Soweto in Johannesburg, were on their way to the 12 Apostles Church’s 40th anniversary celebration in Mevamhlophe in eMpangeni, in northern KwaZulu-Natal when the driver allegedly lost control of the vehicle. The accident happened on the notorious Ndundulu bends near Nkwalini where more than ten women were killed in 2013 when their bus overturned. Inkosi Khayelihle Mathaba of eMacambini Clan also died on the same road in 2014. Members of the church together with Provincial MEC for Transport Mxolisi Kaunda, his Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs counterpart Nomusa Dube-Ncube and African National Congress Secretary General Ace Magashule visited the scene of the crash. The church’s Spokesperson Apostle Joel Sithole says they are saddened by the death of their members. Magashule has sent condolences to the families of the deceased. “It is unfortunate that lives have been lost and I’m sure the province is here with us to pass condolences to the church. This is indeed horrific.” The KwaZulu-Natal Department of Transport has set up a task team of engineers to investigate how road fatalities can be curbed on the mountainous R66 road. The names of the deceased have not yet been disclosed. Police are investigating charges of culpable homicide. Click below for more on the story:
