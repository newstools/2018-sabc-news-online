Eskom has declared a dispute with trade unions National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (NUMSA) and National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) over the precondition that the unions introduced as part of the wage negotiations. The two unions are demanding that Eskom should not discipline employees who took part in the unprotected strike in July and August. However, Eskom says it cannot agree to this precondition. Last week, at a meeting convened under the auspices of the CCMA, the three recognised trade unions including Solidarity all agreed in principle to Eskomâ€™s three-year wage proposal and conditions of employment. The deal was that employees would see a salary adjustment of 7.5% in 2018/19 and 7% in 2019/20 and another 7% in 2020/21. Watch related videos below:
