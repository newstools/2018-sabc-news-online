A 42-year-old suspect is due to appear before the Umlazi Magistrate’s court south of Durban, facing a charge of murder. The man allegedly stabbed to death his 45-year-old girlfriend Nomaswazi Zungu at a house in Nkonyana road at B-section last Sunday. The accused allegedly admitted to having killed Zungu to one of their neighbours immediately after the incident. Zungu’s neighbours said they only heard her scream once and then there was quiet. They say they didn’t go out to investigate because they thought it was their usual fights. A friend of the deceased who wished to remain anonymous said the suspect had been violent before.
