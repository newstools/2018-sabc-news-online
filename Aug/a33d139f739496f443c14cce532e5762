Western Cape MEC for Sports and Culture Anroux Marais has called for all political parties to ensure the protection of women. Marais says women must be protected despite their political affiliation. Speaking at the Women’s Day celebrations at the Mbekweni Youth Centre in Paarl, Marais says violence against women remains a problem all societal stakeholders need to work together to curb. Attending the same event, Miss South Africa Tamaryn Green Africa has urged South African women to encourage each other. “A win for one, is a win for all of us.” She thanked the women who took part in the 1956 march for paving the way to the emancipation of women. Granddaughter to struggle veterans Albertina and Walter Sisulu, Nontsikelelo Sisulu-Singapi, says her grandmother served the country with integrity and dignity. She highlighted that her grandmother was passionate about the advancement of women. Sisulu-Singapi added that Albertina supported ownership of land by women.  “The power of women” Struggle veteran Sophie Bruyn, who was also part of the 1956 march, says today is a reminder of the power of women. She urged young women to draw inspiration from 1956 women. The ANC activist says women should be brave and serve with pride in the positions they hold in society. De Bruyn says she is saddened by poor policing when it comes to violence against women and children. One of the 20 000 women who took part in the 1956 march to the Union Buildings against pass laws, she told President Cyril Ramaphosa that their efforts for freedom and equality are being diluted by poor policing. She says police are ill-equipped to deal with issues of gender based violence, adding that while they don’t have the skills, police also don’t have the sensitivity.  Watch the national event below:
