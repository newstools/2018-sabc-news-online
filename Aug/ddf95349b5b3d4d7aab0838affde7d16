The National Taxi Alliance says it fully supports the passing of the proposed bill on the road accident scheme. The scheme is intended to replace the Road Accident Fund Act and aims to improve the administration of benefits of accident victims. Parliament’s Portfolio Committee on Transport held a public hearing in Welkom in the Free State. The alliance’s provincial chairperson Mangaliso Malindi says: “The scheme is going to be of benefit because previously the person in the accident comes to the owner of the vehicle to claim extra money because they understand that the payment from RAF was not enough. In the scheme the person will continue to benefit from the scheme other than coming to the owner of the vehicle to get a claim.”
