The Gauteng Health Department says health care services will not be disrupted at Chris Hani Baragwanath hospital in Soweto due to mass protest action by workers. The protest is early morning and lunch hour pickets since last week. The workers affiliated to Nehawu, Denosa, Hospersa and the Public Servants Association of South Africa are calling on the hospital CEO to step down over allegations of corruption, maladministration and nepotism. Acting Director General for Hospital Services Dr Medupi Modisane says: “Our understanding is that the staff is actually at work already. The services have started. Their grievances are around the allegations of corruption at the institution.” “As a result of these allegations they have demanded that the CEO of the hospital be removed,” says Modisane.
