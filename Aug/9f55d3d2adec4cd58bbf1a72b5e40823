A strong 6.3-magnitude earthquake rocked the Indonesian island of Lombok Sunday, just weeks after a quake which killed more than 460 people, the US Geological Survey said. The tremor was centered west-southwest of Belanting town in East Lombok, the USGS said, at a relatively shallow depth of seven kilometres (four miles). Residents said the quake was felt strongly in East Lombok. Strong earthquake hits off Fiji, no tsunami threat A strong 8.2-magnitude earthquake struck off Fiji Sunday, the US Geological Survey said, but it was too deep to generate a tsunami and there were no reports of damage. The tremor hit at 12:19 pm (0019 GMT) local time 361 kilometres (224 miles) east of the Pacific nation’s capital Suva, at a depth of 559 kilometres, the US seismologists said. The Hawaii-based Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was “no tsunami threat because the earthquake is located too deep inside the Earth”. The quake, and several aftershocks ranging up to magnitude 6.2, were felt as a rippling effect in the outer Lau islands group but residents in Suva, on the main island of Viti Levu, said they did not feel a thing. The government’s Seismology Unit issued a statement saying the earthquake “does not pose any immediate threat to the Fiji region due to its deep depth”. The quake occurred in the so-called Pacific Ring of Fire, a region of frequent seismic activity due to collisions between continental plates.
