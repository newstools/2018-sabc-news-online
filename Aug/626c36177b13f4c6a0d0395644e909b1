President Cyril Ramaphosa has arrived in Lusaka, Zambia, to hold talks focusing on political and economic development with his counterpart, Edgar Lungu. They will also engage on the political developments, including security matters within SADeC. President Ramaphosaâ€™s visit to Zambia comes amid political tensions in Zimbabwe, where opposition leader Tendai Biti faces charges of incitement to violence among other things. He was denied asylum by Zambia. The next two days are going to be busy for President Ramaphosa. After meeting with the president on Thursday night, he will be heading to the DRC for a meeting with President Joseph Kabila in a bid to persuade him for a peaceful election coming up in December. As SADeC Chair, Ramaphosa will table a report on progress during a meeting in Namibia next week.
