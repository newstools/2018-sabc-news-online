Rand water has begun pumping water to reservoirs in Johannesburg which were affected by the electricity cut as a result of a fire at the Eikenhof substation, earlier this week. Residents are urged to continue using water sparingly as the reservoirs still need time to fill up. Currently several areas including Roodepoort, Randburg, Langlaagte, Southdale and Soweto have been affected by water cuts. Joburg Water spokesperson Isaac Dhludhlu says power has been restored in the Eikenhof area which wil allow Rand Water to start pumping water. He says: “I can also confirm that they have started pumping this morning around 4am. At this moment we are still waiting for Rand Water to stabalise their systems and once their systems are stabalised they should be able to start pumping water to all the affected municipalities.”
