A South African man has been sentenced to death in Vietnam for drug trafficking. The Department of International Relations and Cooperation (Dirco) has withheld the man’s identity. However, a local newspaper says he’s Tyron Lee Coetzee. He was found guilty of trafficking nearly 1.5 kilograms of cocaine. The Department says it is rendering consular support to Coetzee’s family and it will take the lead from him with regard to the possibility of appealing the sentence. Coetzee told investigators he was hired by a Nigerian man to transport cocaine for $3 500 and he would be paid after his arrival in Vietnam, a country where trafficking 100g or more of heroin or cocaine is punishable by death. Dirco Minister Lindiwe Sisulu says there are  800 South Africans currently in foreign jails, many for drug related charges. She appeals to South Africans to familiarise themselves with the legal and cultural practices of the countries they visit and warns against taking part in any unlawful activities.
