Former Government Communication and Information System (GCIS) head Themba Maseko is expected to reveal further crucial evidence about his meeting with Ajay Gupta back in 2010 in Saxonwold, when he gets back to the witness stand Thursday morning. Maseko is the third witness to appear before the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture in Parktown, Johannesburg. Two other witnesses, former deputy finance minister Mcebisi Jonas and former ANC member of Parliament Vytjie Mentor have implicated the Hawks of wrongdoing. Maseko is now expected to testify and give the commission exact details of a meeting he had with Ajay Gupta. He has revealed to the commission that he met Ajay at a board meeting for Brand SA. Maseko explained that in 2010 he received a call from Ajay requesting a meeting to discuss a project that needed government funding. The former GCIS head told Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo that he was reluctant to meet with Ajay as he had noted rumours circulating of the Gupta family’s dealings with government but went anyway to meet him at their Saxonwold home. He further testified that fear of reprisals and the loss of jobs could prevent people from coming forward to assist the commission. He says a number of senior public servants have worked with the Gupta family. “The are middle managers who have had experiences with a number of individuals including the Gupta family, who have information, who may be willing to give that information to your commission. The reason why they may not be able to come through is because of fear of reprisals, loss of jobs and generally the country’s unwillingness or inability to support those who are willing to come forward.” Related videos
