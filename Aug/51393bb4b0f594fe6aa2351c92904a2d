Political analyst Steven Friedman says African National Congress (ANC) president Cyril Ramaphosa is handling the pressure from his own party badly, especially on the land issue. Friedman’s statement comes after Ramaphosa’s statements on land which falls under traditional leaders, especially after a meeting with the King of AmaZulu, Goodwill Zwelithini on Ingonyama Trust. Friedman says: “A considerable number of black people who own property vote for the African National Congress and it’s very obvious that they’re not going to vote for the ANC which takes their property away.” “There is pressure, that’s the point that I’m making. The president needs to ensure that he satisfies the people within the ANC who have property by making sure that their property is safe.” Related Video
