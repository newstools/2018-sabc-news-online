An urgent meeting between Minister of Higher Education Naledi Pandor and the board of the National Financial Student Aid Scheme (NFSAS) is under way in Pretoria. This after board chair Sizwe Nxasana resigned after three years at the helm. Nxasana informed the minister of his decision on Monday – citing “extreme strain” and a challenging few years. In July, NSFAS came under pressure after the minister ordered the body to pause funding applications for 2019 due to a backlog in the allocation of funds. Nxasana’s resignation comes amid uncertainty at the student aid body with disbursements for the next financial year halted. Pending a review on the backlog of the 2017/2018 payments with the 2019 disbursement period due to be processed in mid-September, maintaining stability and consistency will be critical for NSFAS. It is unclear who will fill the vacancy left by Nxasana – who has headed the body since 2015. Click video below:
