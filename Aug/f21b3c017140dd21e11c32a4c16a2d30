Former Public Protector, Thuli Madonsela, has called on President Cyril Ramaphosa to name one of the National Orders after Albertina Sisulu. Madonsela was speaking at a women’s celebratory event at Stellenbosch University in the Western Cape, where the role of women in building a democratic South Africa was honoured. 2018 marks the centenary of the life of Albertina Sisulu who was known for her fearless championing of democracy and human rights. It was women, like Mam’ Albertina Sisulu who started a fearless fight for their recognition years ago. Many others of like mind feel more needs to be done to achieve this. “We will be failing legends if we do not address racism and gender violence. I’m calling on institutions such as Stellenbosch University to find solutions that are based on anger and aggression,” said Dr Geraldine Fraser-Moleketi, Chancellor at Nelson Mandela University. South Africa currently has six National Orders. The President awards the orders to individuals who have excelled in their fields. None is named after women. As Women’s month draws to a close  there’s consensus more dialogues need to be held to uphold the spirit and the work of fearless women like Albertina Sisulu. WATCH RELATED VIDEO:
