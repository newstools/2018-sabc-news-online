The trial of the #FeesMustFall activist, Mcebo Dlamini is expected to start in the Johannesburg Magistrate’s Court on Monday morning. Dlamini is accused of malicious damage to property, public violence and other crimes. He was arrested in October 2016. Damage of close to R800 million was caused to campuses across the country during the#FeesMustFall protests which first started in 2015. During the last court appearance on July the 30th, the state said it had 20 new witnesses – prompting the defence to warn that this may extend the two-day trial period. Meanwhile, Professor Shadrach Gutto says Dlamini is making a mistake by asking President Cyril Ramaphosa to grant pardons to students who are serving sentences because of criminal activities during the #FeesMustFall campaign.
