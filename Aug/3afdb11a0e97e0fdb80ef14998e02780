The vast majority of people at the Eastern Cape hearings support the Road Accident Benefit Scheme, which is set to replace the Road Accident Fund. The hearings in East London are part of the countrywide drive administered by the Parliament’s Committee on Transport. The Bill will see road accident victims make their claims without lawyers and ease any financial burdens involved in the claim process. Member of the Parliament’s Committee on Transport Shiela Xhego says the proposed benefit scheme will assist the masses. Xhego says, “The new Bill looks at assisting those who are on the wrong and those that are innocent and road accident victims. It doesn’t exclude the one who caused the accident and focus only on the victim. It assists all involved in a road accident. This Bill also advocates for the direct payment of the road accident victim.”
