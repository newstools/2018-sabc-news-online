The Gauteng Department of Human Settlements says they are in conversation with some of those responsible for the so called “land grabs” in the province amid efforts to accelerate housing delivery. This is part of the Johannesburg regional summit, which comes after the Department identified a need to interact with all Gauteng communities around the issues of human settlements. MEC for Human Settlements, Dikgang Moiloa, says other issues include funded projects for the current financial year and the rapid release of land. “It’s to have a conversation with the people that have been leading the land grabs, the illegal land occupations. Including those that are occupying the houses illegally. We want them to understand the perspective from which my department, our government is handling their issues. “And hopefully out of this summit there has to be adherence to rule of law. So we can go on with the business of spending the human settlement budget, but also ensure that communities benefit from the development of the projects that are underway in their community.” Watch related video below:
