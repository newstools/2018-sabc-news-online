The National Student Financial Aid Scheme has suspended its CEO Steven Zwane, with immediate effect. In a statement, NSFAS says the suspension follows allegations of maladministration against Zwane. This is pending the outcome of an investigation into the matter.

Zwane’s suspension comes after the recent resignation of Sizwe Nxasana as NSFAS chairperson. Higher Education Minister Naledi Pandor has since appointed a new board and an administrator to oversee governance issues. Watch for more:
