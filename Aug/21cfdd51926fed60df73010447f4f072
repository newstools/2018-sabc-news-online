Attacks relating to traditional leadership disputes have flared up in the Eastern Cape.  This follows the gruesome murder of Dindini village’s sub-headman Thulani Mjanyelwa. Mjanyelwa was allegedly killed by an angry mob who accused him of murdering two brothers from the area. Three weeks ago,  the deputy sub headman’s sons were set alight and killed. The incident sparked outrage. Residents accused the headman of killing the brothers.  The plan to murder the chief is believed to have taken place at a community meeting on Sunday. “It was not supposed to be like this because there are platforms. They can even come to the traditional leaders too if they are not happy about their leader, they can come to the municipality to report his ruling. We are really shocked at what happened,” said acting mayor, Mbulelo Maphetshana. The chief’s wife and his child have fled fearing that they too will be killed. Six people have been arrested and police say more arrests are imminent. The arrests have angered residents and sparked protests; rubber bullets were fired to disperse the crowd. The demonstrators are demanding the suspects be released. They are to appear in the Mbizana Magistrates Court on Tuesday. Watch related video below:
