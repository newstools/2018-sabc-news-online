President Cyril Ramaphosa says that more land should be made available to the fast growing game farming industry. He also says that there should be more role players, especially the black community, in the industry. Ramaphosa was speaking during the biodiversity conference in Thohoyandou, Limpopo. “We’ve got 20 million hectares of land in the hands largely of white game farmers, we can actually increase that to 30 million and by so doing we can bring black people into this growing industry game farming.” “It is growing at a higher rate than our economy and I’ve always said tourism is one area where we can create many more jobs.” Ramaphosa says the country’s biodiversity can help create thousands of jobs. Ramaphosa called on members of the public to take care of the environment.
