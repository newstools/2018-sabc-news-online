The Zimbabwe chapter of the Media Institute of Southern Africa (MISA) has gone to court to demand live streaming access to the elections challenge court proceedings. This after the Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation (ZBC), which has exclusive rights, announced that it would charge other broadcasters 13, 500 US dollars for television and 5, 200 US dollars for radio feeds per day. President-elect Emmerson Mnangagwa is opposing the application. With the limited space in the Constitutional Court, and the tight security, many Zimbabweans in and outside the country will depend on ZBC to follow the proceedings. However, the broadcasters are saying  the fees being charged are inhibitive. MISA’s main argument is that live streaming will reach far more Zimbabweans than ZBC. This as most people can’t watch ZBC at work and the diaspora cannot access ZBC. Watch related video below:
