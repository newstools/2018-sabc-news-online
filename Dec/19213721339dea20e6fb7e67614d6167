The trial of 12 robbery suspects believed to be members of the Mancoba Seven Angels Ministries church resumes on Wednesday at the Ngcobo Regional court in the Eastern Cape. They face charges of conspiracy to commit robbery and robbery with aggravating circumstances. It is alleged they stole litres of diesel from a bus depot at Ngcobo in December last year. The accused were arrested in connection with the alleged robbery of a bus depot while the police were investigating the gruesome attack of five police officers and a soldier at Ngcobo earlier this year. In their last court appearance on the 31st of October, all 12 suspects maintained that they would conduct their own defence. There are four separate cases involving members of the Mancoba Seven Angels Ministries church. Some charges relate to the alleged attack of the local police station, the murder of the Jali couple at Mzimkhulu in KwaZulu-Natal and sexual assault by one of the leaders Banele Mancoba.
