Deputy Minister for Transport, Sindisiwe Chikunga has made a call to motorists, especially young people to refrain from driving under the influence of alcohol. Speaking at the funeral service of Joseph Mabuza who was the Spokesperson for Community, Safety, Security and Liaison in Mpumalanga, Chikunga says traffic officers have arrested a larger number of people driving under the influence of alcohol. Chikunga says traffic officers will be merciless to traffic rule transgressors during the last few days before the New Year. Among the dignitaries that attended Mabuza’s funeral service were Mpumalaga Premier, Refilwe Mtsweni, MEC for Transport in KwaZulu-Natal, Mxolisi Kaunda and MEC Butana Kompela representing the Free State government. Meanwhile, 10 people have been arrested on drunk driving charges in the Western Cape since the start of the weekend. Traffic Chief Kenny Africa says one of the motorists was five times over the legal limit in Somerset West. He says officers also made nine other arrests for various offences including, the possession of false documentation, the possession of a stolen vehicle, speeding and negligent and reckless driving. “We stopped 1 792 vehicles in these roadblocks. 762 drivers were tested for alcohol and the highest reading of 1.29mg/1000ml (was captured). We also arrested five drivers for being in possession of fraudulent documentation –  one in Brackenfell, two in Laingsburg, another one in Swellendam and also one in Worcester.” – Authors- Nadine Speelman and Mthobisi Mkhaliphi
