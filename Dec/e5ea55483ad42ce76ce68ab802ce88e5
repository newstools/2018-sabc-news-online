The City of Cape Town says their Marine Unit and SANParks rangers have disrupted several poaching operations but no arrests have been made. Inspector Wayne Dyason says officers recovered about 25 nets with over 400 crayfish in the Olifantsbos area of the Cape of Good Hope Nature Reserve earlier on Wednesday. He says while the officers were rescuing the crayfish, the poachers attempted to run their boat into the officers’ boat. Dyason says another two poaching incidents occurred on Tuesday – one in St James and the other in Camps Bay. “In the St James area, Law Enforcement auxiliary officers spotted five divers in the water. They called in the local neighbourhood watch and the Marine Unit to assist. The officers pounced but the divers abandoned the abalone and fled back to sea. 268 shucked abalone and 134 unshucked abalone were recovered. On the 11th December, officers from Camps Bay disrupted another poaching operation when they retrieved 12 abalone from the rocks in the Cosi Bay beach area,” says Dyason.
