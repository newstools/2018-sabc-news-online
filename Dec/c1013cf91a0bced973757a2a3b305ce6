More immigration officials will be stationed at the Lebombo Port of Entry with Mozambique this festive season. This is to ease congestion as migrant workers and holiday makers cross through the border post. Public Service and Administration Minister Ayanda Dlodlo visited the border post to assess its readiness for the festive season. “It looks like the equipment used is up to standard. But we need to add stuff for the festive season. We also are meeting the KaMaqhekeza residents and the we have been told that the most challenging service is water,” says Dlodlo.  Mpumalanga Community Safety Security and Liaison MEC Pat Ngomane joined Minister Dladla. Ngomane called on motorists to exercise patience on the road. He warned that law enforcement officers will be fully deployed across the province. “’All our busy roads in the province, your N4, N17 Mloto road will have road blocks throughout the festive season to improve visibility.” Dlodlo proceeded to KaMaqhekeza to address members of the community. The residents raised a variety of social issues. “If government can build us more schools there are nine sections here and we only have two schools,” says a resident. “We need water and employment opportunities to reduce crime,” adds another resident. Minister Dlodlo is expected to visit other border posts to assess the state of readiness ahead of the festive season.
