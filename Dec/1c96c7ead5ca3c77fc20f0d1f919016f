Gunmen have killed at least 17 people in the latest attack on villages in northern Nigeriaâ€™s Zamfara state over the weekend. The assault came just days after 25 people were killed in similar raids on two villages in the region. Residents say gunmen on motorcycles stormed Magami village in the Maradun District area of the state on Saturday, shooting indiscriminately. Zamfara State police spokesperson Mohammed Shehu says arrests are imminent. Zamfara state has been plagued by cattle rustling and kidnapping for ransom, prompting villagers to form vigilante gangs as a protection force.
