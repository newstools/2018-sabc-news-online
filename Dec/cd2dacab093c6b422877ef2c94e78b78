The Water and Sanitation Department says plans are afoot to launch an advanced infrastructure programme at the Ntabelanga Dam in January next year. The construction of the Ntabelanga Dam is the second phase of the Mzimvubu Water Project, with phase one having been completed in 2012. The total cost of the dam is expected to be R15 billion with R7.5 billion expected to be used for the reticulation and distribution of water. Three district municipalities, viz. OR Tambo, Joe Gqabi and Alfred Nzo are expected to benefit from the project. Water and Sanitation Minister, Gugile Nkwinti, says the advanced infrastructure will take up to nine months to complete. “We have taken a decision now. We are going to construct the dam, starting with Ntabelanga Dam and simultaneously we will be conducting feasibility on the Mzimvubu River. The advanced infrastructure will start on January 14,  2019 and that work will be done by the construction unit of the department. It will go to the market for any service provision it has no capacity to do.” Click on video below:
