The Nelson Mandela Bay region in the Eastern Cape has recorded its first death at an initiation school in years. This brings the initiate death toll in the province for the summer initiation season to 21, with most of the deaths in rural areas. Most of these were the results of dehydration, although the exact cause of the latest death is unknown. The Mandela Bay region attributes its previous record of successful initiation seasons to the constant inspection of initiates and schools. Chairperson of the provincial House of Traditional Leaders, Chief Mwelo Nonkonyana has praised the region. He says: “They have just reported one death. I can attest that they have done us proud for many years. Nelson Mandela Bay men stood up and the municipality also assisted as well as parents to make sure that the area in which they were undergoing this custom was cleaned.” “They have used us as the house of traditional leaders to send traditional leaders to guide them and monitor the situation. I think they have done us proud.” “It is however regrettable that we have got 21 deaths in the province,” says Nonkonyana.
