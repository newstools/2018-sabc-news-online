The Department of International Relations and Cooperation (Dirco) says it is confident that a South African man, who is currently in Indonesia, was not affected by the recent tsunami. A volcano triggered the tsunami that killed at least 281 people and injured more than 1 000 on Saturday. Rescuers are battling heavy rains in a desperate search for survivors. Hundreds of buildings were destroyed by the wave, when the Anak Krakatau volcano, known as the “child” of the legendary Krakatoa, erupted. People have been warned of the possibility of another tsunami due to the continued volcanic eruptions. Dirco spokesperson Ndivhuwo Mabaya says authorities are investigating whether any other South Africans were affected. “We have a South African family, who has contacted the 24-hour operation centre that has not been able to contact him. We are speaking to [the] rescue team to see where he has been and to track his movements. We are confident that he is not affected by this and he was not involved in the tsunami. So, that is why we are saying no South African has been reported injured or deceased in Indonesia at this stage.” Click below for more on the story:
