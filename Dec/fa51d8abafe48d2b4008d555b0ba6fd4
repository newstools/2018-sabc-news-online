A third suspect sought in connection with the murder of a prominent politician and African National Congress (ANC) member, Parks Kgaiyane, is expected to appear in the Vereeniging Magistrate’s court in the Vaal on Thursday. The former Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) member of the Gauteng Legislature, who re-joined the ANC in 2016, was shot and killed on the R59 on Tuesday last week. His partner, who was with him at the time, was allegedly raped. Police say Kgaiyane, his partner and the driver were on their way to a gala dinner when the vehicle they were travelling in broke down on the R59. They summoned a mechanic who arrived and whilst busy attending to the car – a group of men arrived on the scene. Gauteng police spokesperson Kay Makhubele says: “When they attacked them he was shot at and died at the scene.  The woman was raped and the other man fled.” On Wednesday police arrested a third suspect in Evaton on the Vaal. Two other accused appeared in court on Monday.
