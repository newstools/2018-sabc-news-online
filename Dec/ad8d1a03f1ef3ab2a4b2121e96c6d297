Congress of the People (COPE) leader, Mosiuoa Lekota, and Afrikaans singer Steve Hofmeyr have laid criminal charges against Black First Land First (BLF) leader Andile Mngxitama for hate speech and incitement to commit violence against white members of society on Wednesday. Mngxitama was responding to billionaire Johann Rupert controversial interview and comments about taxi operators at a rally in Potchefstroom, North West, last Saturday. Lekota says that citizens inciting racial hatred and war are against the constitution. “The constitution of our country and the law in general prohibits hate speech. In fact, even the Independent Electoral Commission Act prohibits registration of parties’ spreading racial hatred, violence against other sections of the population and so on. We can’t take the law into our own hands. So we think it is appropriate to prevail on the law to arrest them and they must be taken to court. If they are found guilty, they must be committed to prison or rehabilitation.” Meanwhile, the South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) says it is in the process of registering complaints against Black First Land First leader (BLF), Andile Mngxitama. This after the Commission received complaints relating to utterances made by Mngxitama that for every black person killed in taxi violence, five white people will be killed by his movement.
