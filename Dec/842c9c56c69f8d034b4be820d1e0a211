The late Thembekile Luthuli-Ngobese has been described as a courageous and humble person whom ordinary South Africans should strive to be like. She was laid to rest on Monday. Luthuli-Ngobese is the youngest daugher of former African National Congress (ANC) president and Nobel Peace Prize Laureate, Chief Albert Luthuli. The 79 -year-old passed away at a Durban hospital of a brain aneurysm. Her life was dedicated to uplifting impoverished communities. Prior to retirement, she had worked at the University of KwaZulu-Natal. She organised community-based programmes to curb the spread of HIV/AIDS. At 63, she obtained a Bachelor’s degree in Community Development at the University of the Western Cape. Her closest friends and colleagues say she lived an exemplary life. “Mam’ Jane was a legend, she was humble but served her people, she was courageous too. She lived her life to the fullest and served her people well. We have to learn from her. We are forever grateful for her contribution to us all,” says Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma. Her family is still trying to come to terms with their loss. “What traumatized us the most is that the youngest amongst us has died. We had hoped that she would live longer and continue working but instead we, the elderly, have been left behind. She has left us. We were just with her at the Luthuli lecture,” says her sister Albertina Luthuli. Her children have promised to follow in their mother’s footsteps. “Community work will not end, even though our mother has died. Community work-based programs are important if we want to uplift our communities. We will make sure that people in their communities are their own strength,” says Nana Ngobese, her daughter. Luthuli-Ngobese is survived by her five daughters, 18 grandchildren and 2 great grand-children. She was laid to rest at her hometown in Groutville, north of Durban. Watch a related video:
