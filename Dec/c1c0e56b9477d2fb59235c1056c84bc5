There’s good news for motorists in the new year; fuel prices are expected to go down. Petrol, illuminating paraffin and diesel are expected to decrease by between R1 and R1.30 per litre according to the Automobile Association (AA). Petrol is showing a reduction of around R1 per litre, with diesel expected to go down by R1.30 per litre. Illuminating paraffin is said to drop by R1.20 per litre. The Association attributes the fuel price decrease to the decline in international petroleum prices and investor confidence in the South African economy.
