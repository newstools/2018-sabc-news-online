The Gauteng Human Settlements Department has request the public to stop sending donations to the Alexandra shack fire victims as they have received enough to help them. Spokesperson Keith Khoza says it’s regrettable that some of the donations were stolen. “The department decided that we should discontinue the outpouring of support because we believe that the response has assisted in reaching as many as possible of the people that needed support. But we are also concerned that in some of the areas, the donations were taken, some of the items went missing.” Hundreds of families were left homeless after a fire destroyed their shacks in the township north of Johannesburg earlier this month. The department says its Disaster Management Centre will no longer take donations because the Alexandra operations have been officially closed. Click on videos below:
