The death toll on Western Cape roads since the beginning of December has risen to at least 98. Nearly 40 of the fatalities were reported on the province’s roads last weekend alone. Provincial Transport Minister, Donald Grant, says the high rate of deaths on the province’s roads can be largely attributed to drivers who do not obey the rules of the road. “There have to be far greater consequences for drivers who flout the rules of the road. I mean all we are asking for is for them to obey the law, stop at stop streets, stop at red traffic lights, don’t overtake on blind rises or around corners where they can’t see what’s coming and not to be impatient, because obviously there are a huge number of vehicles on the road at this time.” Click related video below:
