Firefighters in the Waterberg district in Limpopo say they are concerned that the lack of resources at fire stations might lead to delayed emergency response. Firefighters say resources such as vehicles and items such as the “jaws of life” are also not properly serviced. A firefighter from the Lephalale Firestation, who asked to remain anonymous, says they do not have enough rescue equipment. “We are not ready for emergencies with the equipment, I mean the resources we’re having, when I am talking equipment I’m talking fire vehicles, rescue equipment, we call them laymen or jaws of life. When people are involved, we do rescue them remember those equipment when you have them they must be serviced annually we are just praying for fires not to happen in our area,” says the firefighter.
