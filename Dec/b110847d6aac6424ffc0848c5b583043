United Democratic Movement (UDM) Chief Whip Nqabayomzi Kwankwa says the best way to address the current vacuum in the SABC Board is to dissolve it and appoint an interim one. Four board members, John Mattisson, Khanyisile Kweyama, Krish Naidoo and Mathatha Tsedu tendered their resignations to President Cyril Ramaphosa last week. This has left the SABC Board with only four remaining non-executive members. There were already four vacancies in the board before last week’s resignations. This has left the board without a quorum. An SABC Board consists of 12 non-executive directors and three executive directors. The communications committee has already announced that the vacancies for the non-executive directors will be filled. However, Kwankwa says it will be impossible to fill the eight vacancies in the next few months. “The most logical step to take at this point in time is to dissolve the current board and to put in place an interim board that will oversee in particular the elections process in South Africa and the coverage of the elections process. And then the sixth democratic Parliament can be in a position to do nominations and interviews for permanent board members to ensure stability. But between now and May next year, there is not enough time for the current democratic Parliament to be conducting interviews and doing nominations for permanent board members.” Click related video below:
