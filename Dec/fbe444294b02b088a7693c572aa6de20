Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) says workers have scored a number of victories in the year under review. The labour federation has cited President Cyril Ramaphosa‘s proclamation of the Minimum Wage earlier in December as one of them. After four years in the making, the National Minimum Wage is a work of representatives of government, business, labour and the community under the auspices of the National Economic Development and Labour Council, (Nedlac). “The National Minimum Wage is one of them. The question of the amendment of the LRA in terms of how you have to conduct collective bargaining; question of time-off in dealing with those issues; protecting of the right to strike; the story of Woolworths in terms of the retrenchments that has all the calls to the Constitutional Court; it was just captured one day in the media and it died. The question of Sacau winning workers who were exposed to have been exposed to dangerous hours, working and traveling, exposed to rain and a court came back saying you cannot be putting this terrible hours of work and not provide people with some protection,” says Cosatu General-Secretary Bheki Ntshathsali.
