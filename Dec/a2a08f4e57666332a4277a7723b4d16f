Internal battles in the African National Congress‘ (ANC) Frances Baard Region in the Northern Cape are now negatively affecting service delivery. Phokwane Municipality Mayor Masenya Kalman has been at loggerheads with suspended municipal manager Matshidiso Mogale. This led to sporadic protests from residents and municipal workers. Residents are now demanding better service delivery and have submitted a memorandum of grievances. They say their demands are not being taken seriously and they now want the mayor, speaker and councillors to be removed. The disgruntled residents claim the municipality’s council is failing to serve the community. ANC provincial secretary Deshi Ngxanga says they are dealing with the matter. “They complain about service delivery while we think they’re reasonable, we addressed them. Initially they made a request of 72 hours but we’ve dealt with that matter and you could see that they’re quite understanding, it means they’re actually frustrated.” The ANC has promised to meet all affected parties on Friday to attend to all the demands.
