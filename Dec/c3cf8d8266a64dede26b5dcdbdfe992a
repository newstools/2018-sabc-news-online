Sentencing procedures are expected to get underway on Tuesday in the High Court in Cape Town in the case of child murderer, Mortimer Saunders. The 42 year- old was convicted of the rape and murder of 3-year old, Courtney Pieters in Elsies River last year. The little girl’s body was found nine days after she went missing in Epping Industria, not far from her family home. The Prosecution Authority says it will push for two life sentences for Saunders. The court rejected Saunders’ version that he performed sexual acts on a corpse but infact found him guilty of raping the little girl. The court has granted the girl’s mother, Juantia Pieters immunity from possible prosecution as the NPA had earlier considered pursuing a case of child neglect. Related Video
