Close to 300 skeletons have been found at one of the biggest mass graves uncovered in Sri Lanka since the end of the country’s civil war almost a decade ago. Dozens of women and children as well as men were buried at the site in Mannar where Tamil guerrillas fought security forces during the conflict. Some of the victims appear to have been bound. Mannar was a key battleground in Sri Lanka’s four decade-long separatist conflict in which the Tamil Tigers waged a bloody war against government troops. The war ended in 2009 after a major military offensive.
