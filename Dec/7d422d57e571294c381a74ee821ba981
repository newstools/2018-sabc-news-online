ANC Treasurer-General Paul Mashatile says President Cyril Ramaphosa has agreed to accord late senior official Khabisi Mosunkutu a Special Provincial Funeral. Mosunkutu passed away on Christmas Eve at the age of 69. He had not been well after he suffered a stroke in 2018. Top ANC officials led by Mashatile visited the Mosunkutu home in Kibler Park, south of Johannesburg. Speaking to the SABC at the home, Mashatile said the family has agreed that the burial will take place in January but a memorial service will be held on Thursday. “I spoke to the president this morning. He has already agreed. So, we will now be planning with the family. They have suggested that because of the holidays, we will have to bury next week.” The widow of former senior African National Congress (ANC) official in Gauteng Mosunkutu has thanked the party for their support. A high-level ANC delegation comprising Mashatile and provincial Deputy Chairperson and Acting Premier Panyaza Lesufi visited Mosunkutu’s family to pay their respects. Nonqaba Mosunkutu says the party did not abandon her husband during his illness. “I want to thank the ANC. They never dumped uPapa. They never … they never! The branch has always been here; Women’s League was here through thick and thin; Youth League was here through thick and thin; the branch itself – they were here. Thank you, thank you, very much. It hasn’t been easy.”
