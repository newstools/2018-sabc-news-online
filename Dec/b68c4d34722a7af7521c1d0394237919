Judgment is expected on Wednesday in the case of a school guard accused of raping and sexually assaulting learners at the A. B Xuma Primary school in Soweto.  58-year-old Johannes Molefe faces eleven counts of sexual assault and three of rape. The case is being heard in the Johannesburg High Court sitting at the Palm Ridge Magistrates court in Ekhuruleni. Over the past few weeks, the trial has heard testimonies from various people including young girls who were sexually abused allegedly by Molefe. Most of the witnesses testified that the school instructed them to keep quiet about the abuse. However, throughout the trial Molefe maintained that he is innocent, with his lawyer telling the court that the children were “coached” into lying about the abuse. Initially, 83 complaints of sexual assault were made against the school guard in Orlando East in 2017, but the NPA says only thirteen charges have been proffered against him, after no prima facie evidence could be found on some of the cases reported to the police.
