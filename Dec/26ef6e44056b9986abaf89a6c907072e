The Mpumalanga Department of Community Safety says a memorial service for its spokesperson, Joseph Mabuza, will be held on Thursday at the Communion Church in Mbombela. Mabuza died after his motorbike hit a bakkie which was making a U-turn on the N4 toll road in Hectorspruit east of Malalane. The crash happened a few minutes after Mabuza conducted a live interview with SABC News on the traffic congestion at the Lebombo Border Post between South Africa and Mozambique. “Following the devastating loss of one of the most seasoned communicators in this province, Mr Joseph Mabuza, a memorial service in his honour will be held on Thursday, 27 of December 2018 at Communion Church near Ilanga Mall in Mbombela Municipality. [The] MEC for Community Safety, Security and Liaison and various other high ranking government officials and the residents of Mbombela and Mpumalanga as a whole, are expected to converge and honour the memory of the late, great, Mr Joseph Mabuza,” says  acting spokesperson for the department, Moeti Mmusi.
