Gauteng Premier David Makhura has requested the South African Police Service to provide him with a full report on the incidents that took place at the FNB stadium in Johannesburg after Sunday’s Global Citizen Festival. Many fans who attended the festivals were robbed of their valuables and there are unconfirmed reports that one person was stabbed. Seven suspects were arrested in connection with the incidents on Monday. The SAPS has rejected fans’ allegations that there was inadequate visible policing outside the stadium. The Festival was part of the late former President Nelson Mandela’s centenary celebrations. The Premier’s spokesperson Castro Ngobese says:”The Premier condemns this in highest possible manner. And we strongly believe that this act of criminality should have never happened in the first place.” “We are calling on the law enforcement agencies to work with speed to ensure that they provide that report so that in future such thing does not happen.” For full interview click audio below: <a href="https://iono.fm/e/632794">Content hosted by iono.fm</a> Click video below:
