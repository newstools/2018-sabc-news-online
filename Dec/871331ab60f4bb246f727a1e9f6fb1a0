The High Court in Pretoria will on Tuesday deliver judgment in the case of former South African Revenue Service (SARS) commissioner Tom Moyane. He’s seeking to get his job back and to prevent SARS Commission of Inquiry chairperson Judge Robert Nugent from submitting his final report to President Cyril Ramaphosa. Ramaphosa fired Moyane after suspending him for several months following allegations that he mismanaged SARS. Moyane is attempting to have Ramaphosa’s decision reversed. Ramaphosa’s decision was based on a recommendation of the Nugent Commission of Inquiry into tax administration and governance at the South African Revenue Service. Moyane insists that Ramaphosa violated his rights and acted unfairly by rushing to fire him before his disciplinary process was concluded.   Watch related video below:
