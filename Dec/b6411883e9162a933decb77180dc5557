Democratic Alliance (DA) Chief Whip in the Western Cape Parliament, Mark Wiley, says he is unaware of any request from the African National Congress (ANC) for a special sitting to be held before the State of the Province Address in 2019. The ANC has called for the sitting to be held in order to discuss a finding that Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane made against Premier Helen Zille, in a just released report. This is after Mkhwebane found that Zille violated the Executive Members’ Code of Ethics. Mkhwebane says Zille facilitated her son’s company to utilise its software and educational resources with the use of tablets during recent revision workshops for learners. Mkhwebane found that this is a conflict of interest on Zille’s part. Wiley says a request for the sitting will be considered, should it be submitted. “The apparent request that there be a special sitting before the State of the Province Address has not been brought to my attention and I am the Chairperson of the Programming Committee and I’m not aware of any such request coming from the ANC. We’ll have to consider it on its merits, should such a request come through.” Click below for more on the story:
