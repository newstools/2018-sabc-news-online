The Azanian People’s Organisation (AZAPO) has taken steps to reinvent the organisation. They have appointed young women in key leadership positions. The restructure of top brass in the organisation comes ahead of next year’s general elections. The party says it’s gearing itself to do well and will leave no stone unturned to woe voters. Having performed badly in the previous elections, AZAPO is at the verge of being written off. In the coming election the organisation has vowed that it’s all or nothing. The party’s president says unlike in the past when they did not have the capacity to win votes, this time around it’s going to be different. Meanwhile, the party has expressed its support for the Zondo Commission. They’ve called on the Commission to among others recommend litigation against those who are implicated in state capture activities. Azapo will launch its election manifesto in a few weeks’ time.
