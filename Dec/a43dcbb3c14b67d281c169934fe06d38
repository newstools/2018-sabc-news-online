Former SARS Commissioner Tom Moyane is back in court to argue for his reinstatement and to try to interdict the appointment of a successor. He is appearing in the North Gauteng High Court in Pretoria after an unsuccessful approach to the Constitutional Court. Moyane was fired by President Cyril Ramaphosa last month on the recommendation of Retired Judge Robert Nugent’s interim report. Nugent, who chairs the SARS commission of inquiry, found that Moyane’s tenure at the tax agency had been damaging and advised that Moyane be removed. Last week the Constitutional Court dismissed Moyane’s application to set aside the Nugent commission and to overturn his dismissal. The court said Moyane failed to give grounds for the engagement of its exclusive jurisdiction and direct access. The North Gauteng High Court is expected to listen to arguments on Tuesday and Wednesday. Moyane is also expected to ask for abandonment of all the remaining recommendations by the Nugent commission.
