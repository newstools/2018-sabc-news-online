The East African Community (EAC) Secretariat has postponed indefinitely the 2018’s Heads of State Summit which was scheduled for Thursday next week, raising fears that the regional bloc is troubled. This is the second cancellation in three weeks. November’s meeting failed to take place due to lack of quorum after Burundi skipped the summit. Heads of states from Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, Burundi, South Sudan and Rwanda were due to meet on Thursday next week in Arusha Tanzania. The meeting is now off the table according to a member of the Secretariat.  There was no new date or venue given for the new meeting. EAC ministers were due to meet today, that meeting has also been put off indefinitely. The regional bloc is faced with financial challenges as well simmering disagreements amongst the leaders.
