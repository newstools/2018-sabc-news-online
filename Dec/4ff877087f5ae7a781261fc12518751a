Girma was president of Ethiopia for twelve years between 2001 to 2013, a largely ceremonial role. His death was reported by the Ethiopia Broadcasting Corporation (EBC) and other state media. The cause of death was not given. Girma was fluent speaker in Ethiopiaâ€™s working language Amharic, his native language Afan Oromo as well as English and French. In recent years Girma had been active in efforts to foster reconciliation between former foes Ethiopia and Eritrea who declared an end to two decades of hostility in July.
