Police Minister Bheki Cele says about 50 crime-related cases have been opened following the 2018 Global Citizen Festival in Johannesburg last Sunday. Cele was briefing the media in Parliament following complaints from some concert goers that they were mugged after the event. Cele says a number of police officers including security personnel from eight private security companies were deployed to the venue of the festival at FNB stadium. He says 15 suspects have been arrested for various activities throughout that day. “Fifteen suspects have been arrested, that puts together almost whole day people that were arrested earlier on. People that were arrested for the practical and particular time six and those people have been taken to court and sent back to custody but others that happened during the day have been given bail,” says Cele.
