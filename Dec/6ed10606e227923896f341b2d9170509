Minister in the Presidency Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, has described the late Mendi Msimang as one who understood the power of education. She was speaking at Msimang’s special official funeral service at the Christian Revival Church, in Lynnwood, Pretoria East on Saturday. Msimang was the former High Commissioner in London in the 1990s and African National Congress (ANC) Treasurer-general up to 2007. He passed away this week. In paying tribute to him, Dlamini-Zuma spoke of when she took advice from Msimang about her own education. “We first met Uncle Mendi in Tanzania – and he taught a lot of us about the love of education. When we came out, a lot of us were very militant, and he one day called me and said, ‘you are a fifth year medical student, it would be irresponsible of you to let that go to waste. You have to finish your studies and qualify as a doctor.’  He said to me, go and finish your studies, this struggle will still be here, and you will come and join us and continue – and that convinced me I must go and finish.” Watch for more:
