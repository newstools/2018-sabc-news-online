The Department of Water and Sanitation says although the current national average water level for dams across the country is below 75%, there are no immediate plans to implement water restrictions. Dam levels have dropped as the country experienced a heat wave which only relented on Friday across the country. Department spokesperson, Sputnik Ratau, however says residents are still urged to use water sparingly in order to avoid the need to implement water restrictions. “In terms of the general outlook comparatively speaking we are not in a situation where we should be pushing panic buttons. We are not at the situation where we’ve started contemplating the imposition of water restrictions.”
