Two members of the newly established anti-gang unit in the Western Cape are on Thursday expected to appear in the Mitchell’s Plain Magistrate’s Court for alleged theft. They were arrested on Tuesday. The constables aged 35 and 38 allegedly took money from a safe during a raid at a house in Beacon Valley, last month. Their actions were apparently caught on video. Just last week, Police Minister Bheki Cele reported that the anti-gang unit in the Western Cape had made more than 100 arrests since its inception a month ago. Now, two of its members are behind bars for alleged theft.
