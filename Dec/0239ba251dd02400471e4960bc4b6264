Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA) commissioners are holding talks on how to improve implementation of the upcoming minimum wage with various stakeholders, currently in Cape Town.  President Cyril Ramaphosa announced on Friday that the minimum wage will be implemented on January 1, 2019. It has been set at R20 per hour. The CCMA has been granted more powers and responsibilities to enforce the minimum wage. CCMA Director Cameron Sello Morajane says, “We must educate the nation… that’s the first and the most important thing. Secondly, we must capacitate the case management officers, interpreters and administrators who will be dealing with those cases that are important – because you can’t have a right that you can’t enforce. Once we have done so, then we would be ready to receive cases that come – but what comes with that is not just about changing our rules – it’s also about ensuring the infrastructure that we have is capable of handling the nature of disputes that have to do with the basic conditions and secondly the volumes of cases that we expect.”
