The Democratic Alliance (DA) says Parliament’s Communications Committee must urgently advertise the new vacancies on the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) Board. The four resignations, which President Cyril Ramaphosa has accepted, add to other three resignations and one withdrawal earlier in 2018. DA Spokesperson on Communications Phumzile Van Damme says another advertisement must now be issued with the same deadlines of nominations to close on December the 21st so that they can all be interviewed in January 2019. “The resignation of these board members is most unfortunate. It would have been desirable for board members to stay on board and work together to fix the dire financial crisis facing the SABC which has now been exacerbated by the legal interference of the new communications minister. We will now be writing to the chair of the committee requesting that the vacancies be immediately advertised,” says Van Damme. Click links for more on the story:
