The Johannesburg Emergency Services Department is conducting an operation to crack down on vendors selling firecrackers in violation of the city’s bylaws. The festive season has become notorious in some neighbourhoods for the use of fireworks – especially on New Year’s Eve, but also over Christmas. Spokesperson Robert Mulaudzi says the initiative seeks to prevent incidents of children and animal getting hurt due to the irresponsible use of fireworks as part of the festive season celebrations. Mulaudzi says fireworks bylaws compliance operation is targeting all seven regions of the city. “We just want to urge our residents during this festive season New Year celebrations to use their fireworks safely, not to give them to young children so that we can incidents where young children can lose their hands.”
