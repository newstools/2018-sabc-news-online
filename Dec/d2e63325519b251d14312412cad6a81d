The Gauteng Community Safety Department says a total of 34 people died in 31 road crashes in the province between Friday and Monday night. The department says the highest number of fatalities involved pedestrians, followed by motor vehicle drivers. Reckless and negligent driving as well as excessive use of alcohol have been the contributing factors to the fatalities. Johannesburg Metro Police chief, David Tembe, says drunk driving continues to be a major concern and roadblocks will be intensified throughout this period. He says more officials will be brought in to patrol the streets of the city. “We have got 176 traffic wardens that are deployed in the inner city. The reason why we have deployed them in the inner city, everybody comes to the inner city to buy. So we need to ensure that people in the inner city are safe, buy their goods and they are able to go back home being safe. So we have included to the present one 176 to be in the inner city for this festive season,” says Tembe.
