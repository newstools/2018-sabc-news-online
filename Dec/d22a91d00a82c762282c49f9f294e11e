Eskom will implement stage two load shedding starting from nine o’clock  Wednesday morning this  till 10pm. The power utility says it still does not have enough electricity generating capacity. It says a number of its generators are off-line due to maintenance. Eskom spokesperson Khulu Phasiwe says there are plans underway to stabilise the system. Phasiwe adds: “We cannot say at this stage as to when this will stop. The indication we getting from the national controls is that by this coming Friday we might not have load shedding but its too early to make a call on this one.” “We will continue to monitor the situation but the ultimate plan is to ensure we don’t have load shedding.” Related video
