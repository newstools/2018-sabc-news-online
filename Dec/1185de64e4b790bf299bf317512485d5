The Durban Magistrate’s Court is expected to rule on Friday on a bail application by the man charged with murdering nine-year-old Miguel Louw. 43-year-old Mohammed Ebrahim was the last person to be seen with the boy before his disappearance in July. Miguel Louw‘s badly decomposed body was discovered in September near Ebrahim’s home in Verulam, north of Durban. The investigating officer in the case, Rajan Govender, says while the evidence implicating Ebrahim in Louw’s murder is circumstantial, there is a strong case against him. Govender referred to the fact that the pathologist who examined Louw’s body established that he had been dead for more than four weeks before he was found, which could be the day Louw disappeared. Ebrahim’s lawyer Chris Gounden argued that the pathologist report could mean that Louw was killed while the accused was still in custody as it did not specify the time of death. Gounden told the court that the accused had complied with previous bail conditions in his kidnapping case. The court is expected to hand down it decision in bail hearing marathon.
