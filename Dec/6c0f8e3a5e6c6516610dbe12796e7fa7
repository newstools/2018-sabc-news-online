The quality assurance body, Umalusi, has commended the national and provincial Basic Education departments for ensuring that there were no systemic irregularities in the 2018 matric examinations. The body briefed the media in Pretoria on Friday. Umalusi has approved the release of the 2018 results. Almost 800-thousand learners sat for the final school examinations this year. Umalusi Council chair, Professor Jon Volmink, says efforts that officials put in place in this year’s matric examination are commendable. “Of particular significance, and I think this is very significant, this year there were no leakages of the examination papers. Nothing pollutes the integrity of the examination more than a leaked paper, and this year there were no leaked papers and we’re particularly happy about that. So we want to commend the Department of Basic Education as well as the provincial departments for working tirelessly to achieve that goal.” Umalusi says it has however noted some minor irregularities reported in Gauteng and the Eastern Cape. The Department of Basic Education says it will abide by the academic quality assurance body’s decision not to release the results of learners alleged to have been involved in exam irregularities.
