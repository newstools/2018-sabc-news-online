The South African Democratic Teachers’ Union (SADTU) in the Free State says it is currently taking stock of the learner resources and the state of readiness for 2019 academic year. Provincial Secretary Mokholoane Moloi says they have agreed with the department to expedite the distribution of learner material to some of the poor schools during the holidays break. He says they want to ensure that everything is ready when the schools re-open in January. “We are bit optimistic that things will be better because things are having their resources now but the challenge is where the department will have to buy the stationery for schools. We’ll be monitoring that by the reopening of the schools that everything should be ready considering that the schools should be opening on the 7th very early in the year, so it puts much pressure on all the stakeholders and in particular the department in terms of the stationeries,” says Moloi.
