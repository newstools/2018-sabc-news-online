A 44 year-old man has allegedly raped and infected his seven year-old niece with HIV. It is alleged that he also raped the victimâ€™s six year-old cousin, but the six year-old has not been infected with the virus. This comes as the South Africa observes 16 Days of Activism Against Women and Children Abuse. The man will appear in court for a bail hearing on Wednesday. Trying to understand sexual abuse, the seven year-old girl reached out to her aunt. She wanted to know if her aunt ever experienced rape, a question that blew the lid. A doctor has allegedly confirmed the rapes. The two victims are yet to receive counselling. For more, watch video below:
