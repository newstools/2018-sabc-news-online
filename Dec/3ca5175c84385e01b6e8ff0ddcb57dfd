The City of Cape Town says the MyCiti bus service is almost fully functional. A process to replace workers who’ve been on an unprotected strike since October is underway. They are being replaced with outsourced bus service contractors. The workers are employed by a group of companies making up the Vehicle Operating Companies. They embarked on an unprotected strike to demand a salary increase, better working conditions and benefits such as medical aid. Mayoral Committee Member for Transport, Felicity Purchase says there they are still short of some new drivers. “The workers that were fired because they didn’t go back for disciplinary hearings in terms of labour relations have now been replaced to a large extent, and the MyCiti bus was working this morning and yesterday at the 90% during the peak hours.” The City of Cape Town says an estimated R13 million in damages have been recorded after attacks on buses and infrastructure since the workers embarked on a wildcat strike. The City had to deployed law enforcement personnel to escort MyCiti buses on various routes across the city. Watch associated video below:
