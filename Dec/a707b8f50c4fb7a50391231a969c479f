Mpumalanga police have warned the driver of the bakkie that collided with the late provincial Community Safety, Security and Liaison Department spokesperson Joseph Mabuza’s motorbike that he can run but he can’t hide. The driver fled following the incident which happened when the bakkie was making a U-turn on the N4 toll road in Hectorspruit east of Malelane on Sunday. Tributes are pouring in for Mabuza who was killed shortly after conducting a live interview with SABC News on the traffic congestion at the Lebombo border post between South Africa and Mozambique. Mweli Masilela was part the SABC crew that interviewed Mabuza, “I’m still trying to come to terms with what I experienced yesterday. I never though I’d ever experience such in my lifetime. Yesterday, we did an interview with Joseph Mabuza. Actually, the crash happened less than 30 minutes after we did a live interview with him. I was working with my colleague Sphephile Kunene. She was interviewing Mabuza and I was operating the camera. We were working with him for the rest of the day, together with the MEC.”  Government has conveyed its condolences to the family of Mabuza. International Relations Department spokesperson Ndivhuwo Mabaya has described Mabuza as an excellent communicator. Mabaya says his death is a painful reminder of the growing number of South Africans who’ve lost their lives during the festive season. Transport Minister Blade Nzimande recently put the national death toll between December the first and the 18th at almost 800.
