The Johannesburg Metro Police Department (JMPD) is investigating a case of a new born baby who was abducted at the corner of Bree and Sauer streets in Johannesburg on Thursday. A 24-year-old woman was apprehended after people heard the baby crying inside a plastic bag containing onions and tomatoes. The child is currently hospitalised and police are trying to locate the parents. JMPD spokesperson Kay Makhubele explains, “When the police arrived she indicated that the child belongs to her but so far the police managed to clarify that the baby was not belonging to her and that she was charged with abduction. So far she appeared before the court today.”
