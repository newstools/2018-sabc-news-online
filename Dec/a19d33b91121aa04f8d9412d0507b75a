The African National Congress’s (ANC) National Executive Committee (NEC) deployee in the North West, Obed Bapela confirmed that the fiercely contested provincial list conference is postponed. It was meant to start in Potchefstroom on Tuesday. During violent clashes between delegates at the verification venue on Monday night, one delegate was hospitalised with stab wounds. On Tuesday, it was a different scenario. Delegates appeared happy with the process. Monday night alliance partners and some delegates accused the Provincial Task Team of positioning themselves high on the list, instead of running a clean conference. ANC Provincial Task Team Convenor Job Mokgoro says:”Clearly the issues is that, it was an isolated incident which has now been put to bed, this morning a number of comrades and I, went to visit the affected comrades in hospital, the other we saw was on his feet, he was cheerful . But the necessary processes have to be followed.” Mokgoro is confident the conference will go ahead but ANC NEC deployee to the North West, Bapela was uncertain. Bapela says:”We are cleaning the administration processes and doing ratification of processes as they were supposed to be done. But it is longer than we anticipated, it was beyond us but also a number of disputes have arisen which we need to attend to.” And the disputes seem to indicate that there are deep divisions among ANC members.
