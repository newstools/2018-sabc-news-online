One of the three men arrested in connection with the murder of Inkatha Freedom Party youth brigade Chairperson in the Zululand District has been released with R3 000 bail at Ulundi Regional Court. Sbuyiselo Dlamini was gunned down at Ulundi in northern KwaZulu-Natal in May in 2018. The three accused are facing charges of murder and conspiracy to commit murder. Ulundi Regional Court was packed with members of the public, including relatives of the accused and Dlamini family. SABC News team was prevented from covering the court proceedings and were instructed to seek permission from another Magistrate’s Court in Mashona. Before the SABC reporters were kicked out from the court, the team gathered that Dlamini was killed because of his stance on the irregular awarding of tenders in the Zululand District Municipality. According to the investigating officer’s evidence in court, police have also arrested three more people who attempted to bribe investigation officers. Amongst the arrested is the brother of one of the accused. The investigators have also told the court that they will soon make more arrests. The bail hearing for the other two accused will continue next Thursday.
