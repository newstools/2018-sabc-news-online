Three more people have died in a traffic related incident in the Eastern Cape, bringing the province’s death toll to 96. A minibus taxi collided head on with a car on the R56 between Ugie and Elliot, killing three of the five occupants in the car. Ten people in the minibus sustained injuries and have been taken to hospital in Maclear. Police are investigating a case of culpable homicide.  In Mpumalanga, traffic authorities have again called on motorists to be cautious on the road as traffic volumes are starting to increase on the N4 toll route. A large number of vehicles are headed towards the Lebombo border post connecting the country with Mozambique. Trans African Concessions (TRAC) which is responsible for the N4 toll road says vehicles have started queuing at the Lebombo Border Post. “We are expecting traffic influx especially in the Middelburg Toll Plaza as people will move from East towards the Lowveld and Mozambique. Of course, we have been preparing for this for quite some time as early as October. We started our preparations for the festive season. We have all our traffic systems on full alert. We have stations in various places on the route together with some emergency services to assist with traffic management, as well as to respond to emergencies and accidents that may occur during the pick traffic period,” says TRAC Spokesperson, Solange Soares-Nicholson.
