Three people have been killed in two separate incidents in KwaZulu-Natal following severe storms and heavy rains. Emergency Medical Services spokesperson Robert Mckenzie says two people were struck by lightning in Tugela Ferry and a third person died when a house collapsed. “Tragically two people sustained fatal injuries after their house was hit by lightning. In a second incident near Umsinga High, a 14 year-old boy sustained fatal injuries when their house collapsed on top of them. A ten year-old child was treated and taken to hospital in a critical condition.”
