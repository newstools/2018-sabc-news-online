The body of a 14 year old boy who went missing last Sunday while swimming at Zinkwazi Beach in Kwazulu Natal has been found. That’s according to a company called IPSS Medical Rescue. IPSS says the body was found at Black Rock Beach. Kwadakuza lifeguards found the body while on foot patrol. The boy and a friend had gotten into trouble at a non swimming beach at Zinkwazi. The friend managed to swim to shore – but the boy went missing in the sea. Holidaymakers are urged to abide by the regulations regarding swimming at beaches. It is extremely dangerous to swim at a beach that is not designated as a swimming beach and which does not have lifeguards. Meanwhile, what was meant to be a day out at the sea has ended in tragedy for a sixty-five-year-old Krugersdorp scuba diver. The man’s body was found by a diving boat on Thursday morning at Shelly Beach on the KwaZulu-Natal south coast. Spokesperson for the National Sea Rescue Institute, Craig Lambinon, says all efforts to resuscitate the man failed and he was declared dead on scene.
