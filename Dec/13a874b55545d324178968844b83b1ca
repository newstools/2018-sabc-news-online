Former President Jacob Zuma has vowed to appeal a judgment that he should pay for his legal fees. Zuma said on his social media account that he had instructed his attorneys to appeal. Earlier this month a full bench of the Pretoria High Court, led by deputy judge president Aubrey Ledwaba, ruled that Zuma is not entitled to state funding in his legal battles. The court upheld the application by the Democratic Alliance (DA) and Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) to set aside an earlier agreement by the Presidency, authorising state funding for Zumaâ€™s defence in criminal cases. Posting on his Twitter account, Zuma says in as much as he respects the court decision, he feels the judiciary needs to be consistent in its treatment of all South Africans.
