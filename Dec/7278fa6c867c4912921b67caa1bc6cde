A former SABC employee, who headed Supply Chain management, has accused the broadcaster’s former interim board of flouting regulations and processes in awarding a security tender. This follows a public legal spat about the awarding of a tender to Mafoko Security at the broadcaster. A total of 45 bids were received but only six of them qualified to proceed to the next stage. After evaluation three bidders, Mjayeli, Mafoko and Mabotwane Security Services remained. The Bid Evaluation Committee and the Bid Adjudication Committee recommended the appointment of Mjayeli. But much to the surprise of the broadcaster’s Supply Chain management, the tender was awarded to Mafoko whose score was below that of Mjayeli. The former SABC interim board has now been accused of overlooking all the processes that were followed in selecting Mafoko. Molaudzi said they even sought advice from the national treasury. In a statement the former SABC interim board has defended its decision and says the award of the tender was taken in the best interest of the corporation based on facts and legal advice. The SABC has emphasised that the decision had nothing to do with the resignations of any board members last week. Also highlighted was the fact that the score difference between Mjayeli and Mafoko, which was awarded the contract, was very small. Secondly the contract price was within 1% of each other and that the SABC could also still negotiate a lesser price with Mafoko. WATCH INTERVIEW BELOW:
