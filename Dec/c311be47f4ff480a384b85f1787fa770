The Democratic Alliance (DA) in the Western Cape says they must be gracious in defeat.  This after the African National Congress (ANC) won two of the three by-elections held yesterday in the Western Cape. Two of the wards, one in Matzikama and another in the Cederberg were snatched by the ANC from the DA. The wards became vacant when the councillors resigned, the third ward in Saldanha Bay was retained by the DA. “The ANC obviously managed to get all their supporters out there to vote and unfortunately our supporters stayed away. I think that was the difference yesterday. We will certainly look at why some of our strong DA supporters did not go out and vote,”says provincial leader Bonginkosi Madikizela. The African National Congress (ANC) in the province say it’s encouraged by the results of the latest by-elections held in the province. ANC provincial spokesperson, Dennis Cruywagen says: “There’s a lot of hard work to be done on the way to the 2019 general elections. These wins are significant and important but we are not celebrating a victory for 2019 yet. We have to put in lots of hard work but we have seen what the effects of President Ramaphosa has had on the ANC’s support base.”
