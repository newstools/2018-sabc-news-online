Water and Sanitation Minister Gugile Nkwinti says plans are at an advanced stage for the Mzimvubu Dam project to get underway. Nkwinti met traditional leaders and other stakeholders in Mthatha to brief them on the progress. The project includes the construction of the Ntabelanga and Mzimvubu Dams. Nkwinti says the planned dam aims to help the water stressed rural parts of the Eastern Cape. He says: “The R15-billion includes the R7.5 billion for regulation and distribution. We want these things to happen simultaneously so that when the dam is completed water goes to the dam and then goes to the households. That’s what we want to achieve.”
