Vice Chancellor of the University of Mpumalanga professor Thoko Mayekiso will not to step down from her position. Student Representative Council (SRC) and National Education, Health and Allied Workers’ Union (Nehawu) embarked on violent protests calling for the sacking of Professor Mayekiso. Mayekiso was accused of corruption and nepotism among others. She called on her detractors to produce proof. Mayekiso told the media on Thursday that only the University’s Council can remove her from the position. Examinations were disrupted at the University as a result of the protest.  According to Mayekiso, she has done nothing wrong that warrants her removal. “No Vice-Chancellor is appointed by staff, by students, by political formation. If Council says to me step down because they are the one that appointed me, of course I would step down. As a Vice-Chancellor you are appointed by the Council, the other ones are just noise,” says Mayekiso. Watch a related video below:
