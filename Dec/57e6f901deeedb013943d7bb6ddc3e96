Several United States (US) Marines are missing following a still-unexplained accident off the coast of Japan. US Officials say two Marine Corps jets might have collided mid-air on Thursday during a refueling exercise that went fatally wrong. Seven soldiers were involved but so far two have been found. One was been pulled to safety from an F-18 fighter jet and another was found 10 hours after the collision and brought aboard a Japanese military vessel. Japan’s Defence Minister says that person is in a stable condition and Japanese forces will do their utmost to rescue the six missing. In a statement the Marine Corps said the F-18 and a refueling jet were involved in what they called a mishap and that the two were conducting regular training. They didn’t elaborate on the nature of the incident. US military aviation accidents around the world have jumped nearly 40% in four years, killing at least 133 service members, according to the Military Times. It’s prompted hearings in Congress to address the rise.
