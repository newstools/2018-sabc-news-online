The South African Federation of Trade Unions (SAFTU) has reiterated its dissatisfaction with the national minimum wage of R20 an-hour for a 40-hour work week. This as President Cyril Ramaphosa is due to announce the effective date for the implementation of the national minimum wage this afternoon.  The president will make the announcement during a ceremony at Freedom Square in Kliptown, Soweto. SAFTU’s General Secretary, Zwelinzima Vavi, says people cannot survive on a minimum of R3 500 per month. “We believe that no one can and should be forced into living like that.  We believe it is scandalous that 24-years into democracy we have 60-per cent of workers living below R20 an hour, while others are celebrating this as progress. SAFTU is calling for the introduction of a minimum living wage of R12 500.”
