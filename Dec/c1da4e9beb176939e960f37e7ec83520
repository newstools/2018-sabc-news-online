The Bill seeks to regulate customary initiation practices to curb the deaths of male and female initiates due to the operation of some bogus initiation schools. The Bill will create various structures that can regulate initiation schools in provinces and local municipalities. Speaking during the debate on the Bill,  Deputy Minister for Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs Obed Bapela says that they have been facing challenges with initiation schools since June 2012. “The Bill will also make provisions for municipalities to strengthen their by-laws, regulatory processes. Municipalities must ensure the provision of the necessary infrastructure such as land, clean water, and sites for initiations. Traditional initiation signifies the transformation from boyhood into adulthood. And of significant is the preparation for manhood.
