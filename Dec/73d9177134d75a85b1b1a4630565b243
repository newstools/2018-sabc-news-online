The South African National Blood Service (SANBS) says their current blood stock can only last them for the next three days. The high number of road crashes during the holiday season results in blood being in higher demand than at any other time of the year. SANBS has urged the community to donate blood during this period. SANBS provincial spokesperson, Sifiso Khoza says donating blood should be an everyday activity. Khoza says they need 3 000 units in order to keep going for at least five days. “As of this morning, (Tuesday) we are only on three days stock – so it means that the blood that we have can only keep us going for three days.” “We are kindly appealing to every person to please take 30 minutes of their time and visit one of our nearest blood donor centres or mobile units to donate blood.”
