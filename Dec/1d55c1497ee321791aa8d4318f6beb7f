Pan Africanist Congress of Azania (PAC) veterans have welcomed the party’s newly-elected national leadership. They were elevated at the party’s three-day national elective conference held in Kimberley, in the Northern Cape, over the weekend. Mzwanele Nyhontso emerged as the party’s new president. The PAC veterans have pledged to work with the new party leadership, led by Mzwanele Nyhontso. Nyhontso grew up in the structures of the PAC under the watchful eye of the veterans. They firmly believe that he has the skills and expertise to lead the PAC. Party stalwart, Bishop Waters Toboti says they have confidence in the new leadership. “We know that when we speak of the unity of PAC forces they know exactly what do we mean about that and they are going to do it. And I want to say to them they must not change and the people of SA must unite and they to got love even those people who are not members of the PAC because we are the children of Azania.” Toboti adds that some of the party’s new leaders are tried and tested cadres of the PAC. “I know all of them and for a long time. I have been working with them right through in the activities of the PAC, people like Mbuyiswa and others we were together and including Nyhontso.” Newly-elected PAC President, Mzwanele Nyhontso says his first assignment is to unite the party and campaign for the upcoming 2019 elections. “People have confidence but the reason they were not voting is because of these squabbles and infighting in the PAC so we were losing votes if we can solve that it means that it cannot be difficult to serve this organisation.” However, Narius Moloto — who allegedly snubbed the conference has slammed it as illegal. He says he remains the leader of the party and has already opened a fraud case against the organisers of the conference. WATCH RELATED VIDEO BELOW:
