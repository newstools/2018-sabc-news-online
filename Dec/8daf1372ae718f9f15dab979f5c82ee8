All beaches in Port Alfred in the Ndlambe Municipality in the Eastern Cape remain closed after the sighting of a Great White shark. The apex marine predator was spotted by fisherman late on Friday. Port Alfred’s East and Kelly’s beaches are off limits to swimmers until further notice. The municipality’s director of community protection services, Nombulelo Booysen-Willy, says shark experts will be deployed to monitor the situation. “We have made communication with Port Elizabeth with the shark experts in that area to give indications of how long that specific shark will be in that specific area. The communication will come through to us today, and we will inform the public. So from yesterday up until today we have not received any confirmation from PE, but we will make sure within the next hour we do receive feedback in order for our beaches to open again.”
