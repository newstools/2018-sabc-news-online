The death of Thabo Mosiane, the African National Congress’ (ANC) North West Regional Task Team convenor in the Dr Kenneth Kaunda region, is a major setback for unity. That’s the word from several ANC National Executive Council (NEC) members who attended his funeral on Sunday. Mosiane has been hailed as a central figure in efforts to unify the deeply divided region that’s taken court action against the disbandment of the Supra Mahumapelo-led Provincial Executive Committee (PEC). At the time of his passing, his region was challenging the dissolution of the PEC in court and is now threatening to scupper the North West list conference scheduled for Tuesday. “We are going to miss that capacity, the ability to bring together the different factions of the movement. We need to work very hard for unity in this province, particularly in this region of Dr. Kenneth Kaunda and so it’s going to be so difficult, to find this replacement,” says NEC member Malusi Gigaba. “What happened has happened and in his honour we will ensure that we unify the ANC, we deal with corruption and we build a strong ANC that can be true Parliament of the people of KK and South Africa as a whole,” says ANCYL President Collen Maine. “As an NEC of the ANC we are intervening, hence once we’re chosen to come help in the intervention we will soldier on and we will try to renew and bring unity in the ANC,” Obed Bapela. “It’s going to be very difficult to replace him and I know that there very willing and able replacements but it’s a major loss,” says North West premier Job Mokgoro. Mosiane is survived by his mother and his siblings.
