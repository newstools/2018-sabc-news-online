Former President Jacob Zuma is considered unlikely to accept nomination by the ANC for next year’s elections, even though his name appears on the ANC’s list of nominees for the National Assembly. Zuma’s name appears in 74th spot among the 833 names on the list, which the governing party has just released . Zuma’s salary as an MP would be less than his current benefits as an ex-president. In addition, he faces corruption and other charges relating to the 1990s arms deal. ANC acting spokesperson Dakota Legoete says the final list will be adopted at the their list conferences planned for the 4th and 5th of next month.
