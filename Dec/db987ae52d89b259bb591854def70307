African National Congress (ANC) Chief Whip in the Pixley Ka Isaka Seme Local Municipality at Volksrust in Mpumalanga, Thulani Shabangu, has been granted a R50 000 bail by the Amersfoort Magistrate’s Court. 41-year-old Shabangu appeared in court facing charges of corruption after he allegedly sold RDP houses. He was arrested on Tuesday following a case of corruption that was opened against him in 2017. Mpumalanga Police Spokesperson, Gerald Sedibe says Shabangu has been granted bail under strict conditions. “The court has granted him the bail of R50 000 with conditions that he must report at the Amersfoort Police Station everyday between 8 and 10 and he must not engage into any community meetings regarding housing and other matters. And again, he needs to report to the investigating officer whenever he wants to leave the town so that you get the permission.” Meanwhile, ANC Acting Secretary in Mpumalanga, Lindiwe Ntshalintshali says Shabangu should vacate his position until the case is completed. “We must meet urgently as the officials of the province and we have also instructed the officials of the region to meet and deal with the outcome of the court because he was arrested now and we have been briefed that he was granted a bail. We will be liaising with the relevant region and also with the councillor because he can’t represent us in that position. I think he should recuse himself and subsequent to that, once the matter has been finalised by the court whether guilty or not.”
