A group of Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) members have vandalised an outlet of the mobile communications company Vodacom at the Mall of the North in Polokwane on Sunday. EFF supporters are protesting against an image of party leader Julius Malema and his deputy Floyd Shivambu shown at the Vodacom Journalist of the Year Awards. The image was captioned “Abusers of Democracy”. On Saturday,  EFF members in Tshwane protested against mobile network Vodacom. Various Vodacom shops closed their doors for business as EFF members wearing party regalia protested at stores in Centurion, Hatfield and Eastlynne. EFF Tshwane Treasurer Obakeng Ramabodu said an attack on the party’s leadership, is an attack on the party.
