Mpumalanga’s MEC for Community Safety, Security and Liaison Pat Ngomane says he has learnt a lot from the late spokesperson for his department Joseph Mabuza. Ngomane was speaking at the memorial service of Mabuza in Mbombela. Mabuza died on Sunday after his motorbike collided with a vehicle that was allegedly making a U-turn on the N4 toll road in Hectorspruit. Ngomane told mourners that Mabuza played an import role in assisting him to improve relations with the media. “Joe was a humble man who understood what he stands for; he managed to teach us a lot of things and I think what he taught us we are going to try our best to take it, for what he help me to discover, lot of things which I did not know that I was capable to do.” Click below for more on the story :
