Western Cape Premier Helen Zille is refusing to step down and says she’d welcome a special sitting of the Provincial Legislature to debate the Public Protector’s findings against her. Busisiwe Mkhwebane found that Zille had violated the executive members’ code of ethics by facilitating her son’s company’s use of government software and educational resources in 2014. The provincial ANC has demanded that Zille vacate her office, or that the Speaker convene a special sitting of the legislature to discuss the premier’s future before the State of the Province Address in February 2019. Zille says she disagrees with the Public Protector’s finding, which she plans to take on review. “The ANC knows that it has no case at all and I am quite happy to defend everything that I did because it was the right thing to do and I will do it again. My son, who was a teacher at Khayelitsha at the time, used Education Department property as he did every day to help people during the holidays.” Earlier, Acting ANC Chairperson in the province, Khaya Magaxa, made a call on the Speaker to hold Zille accountable. “Zille is not above the Constitution and must be held accountable. We insist that she faces the music in the Legislature. Speaker, Sharna Fernandez must act as instructed by the Public Protector and take steps within 30 days after having received the report to hold Zille accountable. It must happen before the State of the Province Address to be held in February.”
