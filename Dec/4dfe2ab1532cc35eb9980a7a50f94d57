The Global Citizen Festival will be broadcast on several SABC platforms. The festival takes place on Sunday at the FNB stadium in Johannesburg . South Africans can catch the the spectacular event on SABC 1 TV channel, the SABC Digital YouTube channel, Facebook and Twitter – as well as on radio stations, 5FM and Lesedi FM. The concert line-up includes Beyonce, Casper Nyovest, WhizzKid and Usher. Leading up to the festival, youth were able to earn tickets by doing good deeds in their communities. The campaign generated a whopping R15-billion in pledges, which will be administered through the UN or local initiatives. The public can interact with the SABC’s TV and radio brands during the course of the festival on social media, by using the hashtag #SenzaKwenzeke. The Motsepe Foundation’s, Patrice Motsepe, says “We have always recognised, as part of our African culture, that those of us who succeed and do well have a fundamental obligation to lift up, to assist and to create a better future for those less fortunate, marginalised and underprivileged.” Watch related video:
