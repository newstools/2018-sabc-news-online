Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) members have gathered at Clifton’s Fourth Beach to stage a protest against the alleged closure of the beach by private security company, Professional Protection Alternative (PPA) last Sunday. The EFF had offered bus transport from across the city so people would be able to participate in the protest. The City of Cape Town says PPA  had no authority to close the beach and it will be taking the matter up with Private Security Industry Regulatory Authority (PSIRA) which is the private security umbrella body. The City will also be laying charges against people who slaughtered a sheep on the beach to cleanse the area of what they referred to as “racist spirits” without obtaining a permit. The City will also be filing charges against law enforcement officials who allegedly failed to prevent the slaughter. Cape Town Mayor Dan Plato did a walkabout at the beach earlier on Sunday. He says he will be meeting with various role players including the PPA security company and the rate payers from Monday, to get an understanding of what actually transpired last week. He has reiterated his view that the matter is been politicised. Click below for more on the story:
