An alleged member of a group that robbed an Eastern Cape police station of fireams and ammunition will on Thursday appear in the Humansdorp magistrate’s court. Mpumelelo Magwala was allegedly one of four men who stormed into the Kareedouw police station in August this year. They handcuffed the constable on duty, opened the safe and made off with R5 rifles, handguns, ammunition and a police radio. Magwala was arrested on Tuesday in Port Elizabeth by the Hawks’ Serious Crimes Unit. He was initially arrested earlier this month in Motherwell for unlawful possession of a fiream, which has since been linked to the Kareedouw robbery. Constable Yandiswa Feni, who was on duty at the police station on the night of the robbery, has also been arrested on suspicion of complicity.
