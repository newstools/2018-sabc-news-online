A report released by the Hlanganisa Institute and the Joint Gender Fund, highlights the vulnerable state that women with disabilities are confronted with daily. They are at a higher risk of being victims of gender based violence in South Africa. As the country celebrates Disability Month as well as 16 days of activism, the spotlight is being shone on the vulnerable groups. People with disabilities, a vulnerable group, and being a woman adds its own set of challenges. Some end up being mentally and sexually abused. Many however, never get justice. Miranda Lephoko was not born with impairment. She was left paralysed after being shot by her husband. National Council for People with Physical Disability Miranda Lephoko says: ”I just turned and looked at him he was already pointing the gun at me, so I started screaming and the reason why was to alert my dad of what was going on. “I looked at him in the eyes when he fired the first and second shot. You know as I was falling down I thought this man has been saying that he is going to kill the both of us and today finally he did it.” Author and researcher on the report of gender Dr Sisa Ngabaza says she found that while there is legislation in place trying to find practical ways of creating a safe environment for people with disabilities, is not easy. The Hlanganisa Institute, commissioned the report. Hlanganisa Institute for Development Bongiwe Ndondo says: “A lot of the material that we produce is made for people like you and I, not many of the materials are translated into brail, you go to events and no one does sign language. We need to mobilize resources.” Its hoped that the private and public sectors can come to the table to work with NGO’s in assisting this marginalised group.
