The DA in Gauteng says it is disturbed at what it says is the leniency shown to those found guilty in the jobs-for-sale scandal at the Bheki Mlangeni hospital in Soweto. It says of the 63 people fingered in the scandal – 52 of them received sanctions short of dismissals. Gauteng Health MEC Gwen Ramokgopa – in a written reply to a DA question in the Gauteng Legislature – says the 52 were given sanctions, suspensions without pay including final written warnings. Only eleven were dismissed or resigned in the wake of the disciplinary hearings. DA Gauteng health spokesperson Jack Bloom says, “I think that this scandal on jobs for sale must be stamped out ruthlessly. I think it’s very unfair that people pay for jobs better qualified people could’ve got, and I think there needs to better fair access for jobs. People should know that they getting jobs on merit not because they paid for them.”
