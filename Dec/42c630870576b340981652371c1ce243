ANC councillor, Moses Maluleke, has been elected mayor of the Collins Chabane Municipality in Malamulele, Limpopo. Maluleke fills the vacancy left by Joyce Bila, one of the seven mayors that the ANC dismissed after some municipalities illegally invested funds in VBS Mutual Bank. The Collins Chabane Municipality deposited about R120 million in the now liquidated mutual bank. Council speaker, Elvis Lebea, declared Maluleke the mayor following uncontested nominations. “With the power vested in me as the chairperson of this council, I declare councilor Moses Maluleke to be the mayor of Collins Chabane as from today.” Maluleke says that his administration is committed to ensuring transparent financial management. “We remain committed to our objectives of protecting our community well being, sound financial management, of improved governance and administration, integrated local economy and lastly of effective community participation, our focus in line with these strategies are in developing and strengthening the local economy, creating jobs.”
