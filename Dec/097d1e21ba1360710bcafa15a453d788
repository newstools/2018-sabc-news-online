Democratic Alliance (DA)  leader, Mmusi Maimane, says South Africans are headed for a Black Christmas. He was referring to the current Eskom crisis which has precipitated power outages countrywide. The DA spoke to the SABC News after its final sitting of the party’s Federal Executive in 2018. Maimane says the power crisis is the responsibility of President Cyril Ramaphosa. He says the President participated in many decisions that led to the appointment of the Eskom board. Maimane says Ramaphosa must take responsibility for ignoring critical issues at the time when he served as Deputy President. The DA reiterated its position that Eskom split into separate power production and distribution entities. This will allow cities to  purchase electricity direct from Independent Power Producers. Meanwhile, the DA also welcomed the appointment of the new head of the NDPP, Shamila Batohi. “It’s going to be crucial that even though she comes in afresh that we restored the credibility of the NPA. Those who were involved in state capture and corruption be dealt with effectively and politicians who are corrupt end behind bars.” Meanwhile, the DA leader is confident of performing well in the 2019 poll.
