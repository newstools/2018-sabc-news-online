Comair is facing a possible strike by its workers affiliated to the National Union of Metal of South Africa (Numsa).  Should the strike proceed, it will likely affect airlines services this week. The disruptions could affect passengers travelling to various holiday destinations this festive season. Comair has assured commuters that flights will continue as scheduled. The aviation company says the strike planned by the Numsa cannot go ahead legally. This comes after the union announced its plans to down tools next week Thursday. Comair says Numsa’s strike will be unprotected because the union has not received a certificate to strike. According to Comair Executive Director, Wrenelle Stander, a strike is only legal once the CCMA has mediated both parties and still fail to reach an agreement. Numsa is demanding a wage increase of 12%, a guaranteed 13th cheque, travelling allowance and a daily overtime allowance. Meanwhile, the Civil Aviation Authority (SACAA) grounded CemAir flights over safety concerns. Transport economist, Dr Joachim Vermooten says “Everywhere there is focus on safety in the last three years. There has been no major incident in Africa. It’s a demonstration of the direction taken; it implies that the aviation authorities are more stringent and applying regular safety oversight on airlines which is in the public interest.”
