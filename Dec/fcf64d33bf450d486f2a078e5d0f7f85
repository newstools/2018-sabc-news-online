The case of the Walter Sisulu University (WSU) student who erroneously received a R14 million payment from National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS), has been postponed to January the 18th in 2019 for trial. This after the accused Sibongile Mani, a third year Accounting student on Potsdam campus of the university, made a brief appearance in the East London Magistrate’s Court in the Eastern Cape. Mani is facing theft charges after she spent over R800 000 of that amount. The Hawks arrested her in May after she failed to report the “error”. NPA Regional Spokesperson Tsepho Ndwalaza says Mani has a case to answer. “Well, I am in a position to confirm that the case has been postponed to the 18th of January for the start of the trial and we believe that we are ready for the trial and we will take it from there. We know for a fact that the accused has got a case to answer in a court of law and whatever the court is to decided it will depend on the evidence we have. (If) its conclusive or not,” says Ndwalaza.
