Tiger Brands has re-opened its Enterprise meat processing plant at Polokwane. This follows nine months of operations being halted after the deadly listeria bacteria, which claimed 218 lives in a two-year listeriosis outbreak, were traced to the factory. Inspectors from the Capricorn District Municipality earlier gave Tiger Brands a certificate for resumption of operations after the completion of disinfecting processes. Chief Officer of Corporate Affairs, Mary Jane Morifi says cold meat products produced at the factory will be back at stores soon. “We are hoping you will be able to see our products in the shelves before the year result and hopefully consumers will have an opportunity during the festive season to once again enjoy the much loved Enterprise.  We are building up into getting back into normal this is day one and we will be working very hard to get it back in steady state.” Watch associated video:
