Political analyst Ongama Mtimka has warned new political parties that they will struggle to get funding. The warning comes after labour federation SAFTU dealt a major blow to its affiliate trade union NUMSA last month by rejecting its newly-registered Socialist Revolutionary Workers’ Party. NUMSA founded the party in the hope of attracting workers as it considered whether or not to contest the 2019 national elections. Other new parties are GOOD which former Cape Town mayor Patricia de Lille will launch next month and the former SABC COO Hlaudi Motsoeneng’s National Content Movement. Mtimka says the new parties will be forced to settle for coalitions. “We already have the EFF, DA and ANC vying for political party funding. So these for me I don’t think will be sustainable enough. In fact what killed the United Front before it even started in 2016 after being affiliated to NUMSA was precisely because there was no funding. Getting numbers of votes is one thing but the power broking that comes when you are able to get just one seat or two, encourages a number of political parties.” CLICK ON RELATED VIDEO:
