The International Energy Agency (IEA) predicts that by 2035, developing nations will constitute 80% of total global energy production and consumption. A greater portion of this new generation will be derived from renewable sources in response to adhering to international policies for cleaner energy. While the costs of renewable generation are declining, concern for energy storage that is essential for the effective utilisation of these renewable sources is on the rise. Energy Centre Manager at the South African Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), Dr Clinton Carter-Brown says economic growth is happening on a global scale. “A lot of the global growth and energy demands are in developing countries in terms of those growing economics.” Click link for full interview  Carbon dioxide emissions from the world’s advanced economies are set to rise slightly in 2018, breaking a five-year decline, mainly due to higher oil and natural gas use, the International Energy Agency (IEA) says. Based on the latest energy data available, energy-related carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in North America, the European Union and other advanced economies in Asia Pacific are set to increase by around 0.5 percent in 2018. Emerging economies are also expected to emit more carbon dioxide this year than in 2017, the IEA said. The agency will release its final global energy and CO2 data for 2018 next March. Current data suggests emissions growth globally, the IEA said. Even though renewable energy deployment is growing and coal consumption declining in some parts of the world, oil demand and natural gas use have been growing this year. –Additional reporting by Reuters
