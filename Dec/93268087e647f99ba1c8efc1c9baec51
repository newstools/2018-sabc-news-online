A KwaZulu-Natal driver who has been apprehended for driving at a speed of 193km per hour in a 120km per hour zone is expected to appear in the Gingindlovu Magistrate’s Court on Tuesday. This is the first suspect to be arrested driving at an excessively high speed in KwaZulu-Natal since the beginning of the festive season. The Road Traffic Inspectorate Director Victor Chetty says drivers should respect speed limits. “What we are picking up is that we are getting the attention of the motorists and Friday we had 95 people arrested for drinking and driving. That is one of the contributing factors to road fatalities. 718 motorists in the province were arrested for speed. Yesterday, in the north coast, going towards Gingindlovu we had a vehicle stopped driving at 193 km per hour at zone of 120 km and the motorist was arrested,” says Chetty. Meanwhile, in Limpopo, traffic authorities say the traffic congestion at the Beitbridge border post into Zimbabwe is under control. Earlier traffic was backed up on the N1 outside the border as hundreds of vehicles were going through the border. Transport Spokesperson Allen Matsila says they engaged their immigration and customs counterparts responsible for processing papers. “This morning, we had this challenge of Beitbridge congestion and as we speak now we have made it a point that we are able to manage the flow as we speak. We have engaged the other operators within the border precinct to make sure that we are able to move the buses. The truck, the buses and the light motor vehicles … we just remain, as we speak now, with the heavy trucks that we are busy with SARS to make sure that we move them and allow them to cross the border,” says Matsila.
