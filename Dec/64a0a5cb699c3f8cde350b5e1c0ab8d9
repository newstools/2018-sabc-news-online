Western Cape Premier Helen Zille will seek a legal opinion on the validity of the contract of Overstrand Municipal Manager, Coenie Groenewald.  This emerged after a lengthy meeting with the leaders of Zwelihle and Overstrand Unite in Hermanus. Last week Friday, a large crowd representing various communities, marched to the Civic Centre to demand the resignation of the municipal manager who they accuse of corruption. Saturday’s meeting came up with a comprehensive plan to address the communities list of 22 demands and grievances. “The Premier, myself and the Mayor will visit Zwelihle and Mount Pleasant and look at the examples because there’s been widespread allegations of corruption in the housing allocation. The Premier will seek a legal opinion on the validity of the contract of the municipal manager that he is corrupt and he did this and that. The Premier said bring that forward and when we get that we will look at the specifics,” says the municipality’s constituency head, Mazisole Mnqasela.
