The African National Congress (ANC) will on Wednesday hear the case involving its National Spokesperson and National Executive Committee (NEC) member, Pule Mabe. An Internal Grievance Panel of the party will hear allegations of sexual harassment levelled against Mabe by his Personal Assistant. The 26 year old woman cites two incidents in which she says she fobbed off Mabe’s advances, one at the St George’s Hotel outside Pretoria and the other in Limpopo. Mabe is currently on leave following the sexual harassment allegations against him. The ANC says he requested that he be allowed to be absent from work until the finalisation of the internal grievance brought against him. The governing party has since accepted his request and will only be speaking on the matter following its finalisation. Meanwhile the ANC Women’s League has called for his suspension from the party pending the outcome of the case.
