The Minister of Public Enterprises, Pravin Gordhan, says there have been more than 1 000 disciplinary cases initiated against Eskom employees since the inception of the new board. The power utility has been embroiled in controversy with allegations that it is one of the institutions that were targeted by individuals, who were central in state capture. The organisation, which has asked for bail-outs from the government, has been responsible for what has become known as load shedding. These are the rolling blackouts to avert a total collapse of the power grid. While these are ironically meant to help keep the lights on, the blackouts have a negative impact on the economy. Parliament had its own inquiry about mismanagement and corruption at Eskom. The inquiry recommended that 10 witnesses, all former senior employees at the power utility who presented conflicting evidence before Parliament, be called by the Zondo Commission of Inquiry into State Capture. Parliament wants the witnesses to shed more light on state capture allegations at Eskom during their tenure. They include former board chairpersons Zola Tsotsi and Ben Ngubane, former interim chairperson, Zethembe Khoza, former CEO Brian Molefe, former acting CEOs Sean Maritz and Matshela Koko, former CFO Anoj Singh, as well as other former board members. Gordhan has revealed that 1 067 disciplinary cases have been instituted since the inception of the new board. He says 977 of these have been finalised, 64 resulted in dismissals while 288 are suspensions without pay. Gordhan also says 233 employees received final warnings, while 321 are given written warnings. 69 have been handed not guilty verdicts. The Minister adds that two others are receiving counselling.
