Seven suspects arrested in connection with the attacks on people who attended the Global Citizen festival at the First National Bank (FNB) stadium in Soweto on Sunday are to appear in court soon. They were arrested on Sunday by the Johannesburg Metro Police. Many fans who attended the Festival were robbed of their valuables when they left the stadium after the concert. The South African Police Department has denied allegations that there was no visible policing. Johannesburg Metro Police Department (JPMD) spokesperson, Wayne Minnaar says: “JMPD have arrested 7 suspects for robbing fans attending the Global Citizen concert on Sunday. “The fans were forced to leave the area near the stadium to go to the Sasol filling station to be able to call Uber. And that is where the suspects had the opportunity to rob them of their cellphones and other personal belongings.” Watch related videos below
