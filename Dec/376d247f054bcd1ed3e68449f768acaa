The case against a 43-year-old man from Verulam, north of Durban accused of raping his stepdaughter has been postponed to the 11th of January 2019. This is for the State to decide whether the case will be heard in the regional court for trial. The accused appeared briefly in the Verulam Magistrate’s Court on Thursday morning, via video from the Westville prison where he is being detained. He was arrested in June this year for the alleged rape of his 10 year old step daughter. He is facing charges of rape, sexual assault, sexual grooming of children, displaying pornographic material and intent to do grievous bodily harm. It is alleged that he raped her more than 900 times since her mother’s death 5 years ago. He has denied all charges.
