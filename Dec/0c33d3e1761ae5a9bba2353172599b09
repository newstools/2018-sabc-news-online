Pupils at the centre of 2015 mass copying scandal are fighting for their matric results for all subjects to be released. The prolonged battle between the Department of Education and Mashiyamahle High School in Ndwedwe, one of nine schools, is still on-going. The pupils are demanding the release of all their original results that were withheld for four years due to allegations of cheating. Learners were asked to write supplementary exams,  however their results have not been released. Basic Education Department spokesperson, Elijah Mhlanga says that calls for interviews and investigations were met with reluctance and violence. He also states that the department has moved the certificates from being issued at the school to the district officers. “The results have always been available, it’s only that we withheld subjects that the allegations of group copying but they have been demanding that all results including the subjects that there were allegations on be released.” Click on related interview: <a href="https://iono.fm/e/633400">Content hosted by iono.fm</a> Watch related video:
