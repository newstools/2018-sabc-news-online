Factional battles for the leadership of the Pan Africanist Congress (PAC) are expected to be put aside this weekend when the party holds its national elective conference in Kimberley. Those organising the conference say the expected election of a new national executive during the conference will go a long way in finally addressing the issue of leadership in the party. The conference has however already been met with resistance from one of the party’s leaders – Narius Moloto, who has called it illegitimate. “That is not the PAC national conference. These are people who were expelled from the PAC… now you cannot unify the PAC when you are not a member of the PAC. The PAC has been dogged by various leadership battles over the past decade. Three leaders – Narius Moloto, Letlapa Mphahlele and Luthando Mbinda have all claimed to be the true president of the PAC. The three have been engaged in a war of words and court action to stop each other from claiming the presidency. But, the party now says it is committed to unifying the three factions following a unity conference held in Kimberley in August. Letlapa Mphahlele and Luthando Mbinda have previously committed to put their differences aside and work towards unifying their warring factions. Mphahlele was not available for comment although Mbinda has called the conference a watershed moment for the party ahead of the 2019 elections.
