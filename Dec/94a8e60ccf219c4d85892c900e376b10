Eastern Cape police have arrested a 13-year-old boy for the murder of his 29-year-old sister at Nquma village. It’s alleged that the boy intervened when his sister was assaulting their mother. Police spokesperson Jackson Manatha says the sister was stabbed on her upper body. Manatha says the suspect will be handed over to social workers, as he is still a minor. “The deceased was having a quarrel with her mother and was beating her mother when the young boy tried to intervene; unfortunately he took out his knife and stabbed his sister on her upper body who died instantly at the scene. The suspect will be taken to the social workers. He is expected to appear in the Willowvale Magistrate’s Court,” adds Manatha.
