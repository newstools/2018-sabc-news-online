The first witness in the rape trial of Nigerian pastor Timothy Omotoso, Cheryl Zondi has established a foundation that she says will create awareness around sexual abuse particularly in cultural and spiritual spaces. The 22-year old university student earlier told her story of alleged sexual assault that started when she was 14. Zondi has received major support from activist groups around the country. The Cheryl Zondi Foundation is supported by the CRL Rights Commission. Launching the initiative at the offices in Braamfontein in Johannesburg Tuesday morning, Zondi says the non-profit organisation will assist survivors of sexual abuse. Watch related video:
