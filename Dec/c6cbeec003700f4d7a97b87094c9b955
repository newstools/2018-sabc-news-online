Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) president, Julius Malema, will challenge the constitutionality of the Riotous Assemblies Act of 1956 in the High Court in Pretoria on Wednesday. Malema is facing separate charges under the Act in the Bloemfontein and Newcastle magistrate’s courts for his calls on EFF supporters to illegally occupy land. The charges relate to two incidents, the first dating back to when he was elected EFF president. In 2014 Malema told the EFF’s elective conference in Bloemfontein that they would occupy unoccupied land because they needed it. At the time‚ AfriForum laid criminal charges against Malema. The second case is from June 2016‚ when Malema told supporters in Newcastle, KwaZulu-Natal to occupy white owned land The EFF says the ANC government is using apartheid-era legislation to charge and silence Malema. If the application is successful, and the Act is ruled unconstitutional, the charges against Malema will be dropped. The matter was postponed in September to 12 December.  Watch related video below:
