The investigating officer in the Vlakfontein murder case has told the court that he found blood at the Khoza household when he was called to the crime scene in Lenasia. Banele Ndlovu was under cross-examination in the Protea Magistrate’s Court in Soweto earlier on Wednesday. Yesterday, the case of the two men accused of the murders, Vusi Mabaso and Fita Khupe was postponed after Mabaso fell sick. In October, Mabaso allegedly used a weapon, which his co-accused had bought, to kill the family. Mabaso also says Khupe forced him to carry out the murders because he wanted the family’s house. Ndlovu named the victims during cross-examination. “It’s Lerato, Nomfundo, Nkanyiso and Luyanda. (When you say you looked around and you saw blood spatters, where did you see these blood spatters?) On the walls and on the ceiling. (How did you observe the blood spatters?) There was much of it, Your Worship and it was visible to the naked eye,” says Ndlovu. Watch related video below:
