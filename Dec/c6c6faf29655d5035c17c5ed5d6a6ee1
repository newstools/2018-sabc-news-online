The funeral service of an 18-year-old teenager who allegedly fell to her death at Mmabatho stadium in Mahikeng in the North West will be held Saturday morning. Oratile Lesego Khukhwana attended the hip hop leg of the Mahika Mahikeng Cultural Music festival when she met her untimely death last weekend. The funeral service is expected to be held at St Hendry’s Catholic Church in Montshioa Township in Mahikeng. Earlier this week her family described Oratile as someone who was quiet but determined to be successful. She had just completed her matric examinations and the Mahika event was her first outing after the examinations. Meanwhile the safety of the stadium which came under scrutiny after the tragedy has been endorsed by both the stadium management and disaster management in the Mahikeng local municipality. Meanwhile provincial police spokesperson, Sabata Mokgwaabone, says no-one has come forward with any new information on the matter, but investigations are on-going. “We managed to ensure that post-mortem is conducted. Unfortunately we cannot at this stage disclose the post-mortem results because they are part of the package that will be sent to court so that the court can make decision.  We can also indicate that at this stage none came forth to indicate that he or she might have seen something that would make us to suspect that there was a foul play.” CLICK ON VIDEO BELOW:
