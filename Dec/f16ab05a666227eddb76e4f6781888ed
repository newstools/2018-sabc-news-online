Gauteng SACP Chairperson Joe Mpisi has expressed a total disapproval of the treatment of former Transport MEC Khabisi Mosunkutu by the Chris Hani Baragwanath Academic Hospital. Mpisi addressed mourners at Mosonkutu’s memorial service in Pimville, Soweto, on Saturday. Mosunkutu died on Monday evening and a provincial official funeral is to be held next Thursday. His ill-health dominated headlines after his wife reported that he had been turned away at the hospital. The hospital has since rejected the allegations. Mpisi says what the hospital did is completely unacceptable. “As the communist party, we are saddened by the treatment comrade Mosunkuthu received at Bara. We want to call on public servants in our province and nationally that the ‘batho pele’ principle must apply and it must not say who you are but it must apply to all South Africans. Workers must understand that no one must be returned home when they are sick. No one must be treated badly when they’re sick.” The former Gauteng Transport MEC, Khabisi Mosunkutu cared dearly for his family. That’s according to his son-in-law Chris Hlahane. In an emotional tribute, Hlahane says he was honoured to have Mosunkutu declare him as his own son. He says Mosunkutu loved his family. “I could go on and on about his life if I could, I could even write a book. I’ve known him for ten years. I’ve known him as someone who loved his family very much, with all his heart and I stand here because I am one of his sons, that’s how much he loved his family. He adopted me to be one of his sons because he used to say to me “You’re not a son-in-law here, you are my son!” – Additional reporting by Zoleka Qodashe Watch related video below:
