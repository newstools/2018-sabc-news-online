President Cyril Ramaphosa has warned of the threat of populism and protectionism to the global world order. He was speaking as he chaired his final meeting of the BRICS nations before the presidency moves to Brazil, on the sidelines of the G20 Summit in Argentina. Taking his place among the rest of the world’s wealthiest nations, Ramaphosa had a warning for some of them. “In the economic sphere as we note that the unilateral tendencies seem to be gaining traction we should uphold the principles of working together, cooperation and also multilateralism,” he expressed. In a statement ahead of his departure for Buenos Aires, the Presidency said it views the meeting as an opportunity to advance global governance reforms and attract new investment to South Africa. Ramaphosa’s message for the world’s leading developed economies meeting at the G20, is that South Africa is open for business.  Even as President Ramaphosa warns against protectionism, the Chinese and American Presidents are preparing for the next round in their trade dispute. That meeting is due to take place over dinner on Saturday night. The US, China trade relations look set to eclipse almost everything else at the G20 summit. But whatever happens here when Mr Trump meets Mr Xi, there’s no doubt it will affect every nation – including South Africa, but President Ramaphosa will be holding bilateral meetings of his own with an aim to strengthen relations with other countries whilst presenting South Africa as an investment destination and trading partner.
