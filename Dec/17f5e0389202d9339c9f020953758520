Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu has expressed his condolences to the family of former Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) Deputy Chairperson, Dr Alex Boraine – who died in Cape Town on Wednesday morning at the age of 87. Boraine worked closely with Tutu throughout the TRC process. In a statement issued on behalf of the Desmond and Leah Tutu Legacy Foundation, Tutu has described Boraine as a dear friend and true gentleman who loved this country. Tutu says he would not have managed the massive TRC work without Boraine. “We mourn the passing of Alex Boraine who died peacefully at his home in Cape Town this (Wednesday) morning. He is survived by his wife Jennifer Boraine, his four children, Andrew, Catherine, Jeremy and Nicholas, their spouses and seven grandchildren. We remember him first as a loving and wise husband, father and grandfather. We salute his lifelong dedication to non-racialism, human rights, democracy and social justice in South Africa and around the world. Most of all he inspired us with his passion for life and his big heart, “ says  Boraine’s son, Jeremy.
