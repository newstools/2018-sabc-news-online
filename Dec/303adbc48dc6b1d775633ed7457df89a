The Arts and Culture Department says it’s important for everyone to work towards unity in the country. This as the country celebrates reconciliation day on Sunday. Director-General at the department of Arts and Culture, Vusi Mkhize says South Africa can only thrive if the people are united. “To have this Reconciliation Day is a constant reminder that division based on race, gender class issues should not and should never be tolerated on any form of division in a society it can only take us back. So this is just to remind South Africans consistently that the past was painful but the future is better, but most importantly that with our diverse cultures and the nature of our South African society we can only thrive if we are united in our diversity.” President Cyril Ramaphosa will deliver the keynote address at the official Reconciliation Day celebrations at the Walter Sisulu University Stadium in Mthatha, Eastern Cape. Ramaphosa is also expected to open an agricultural project near Ncise village in the Mthatha area before delivering his keynote address. Thousands of people are expected to attend the celebrations where a huge marquee has been erected in the stadium.
