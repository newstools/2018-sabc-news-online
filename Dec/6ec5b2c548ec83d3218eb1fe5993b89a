The life and work of former Deputy Chairperson for the Truth and Reconcilation Commission, Alex Boraine has been applauded during his memorial service in Cape Town. He passed away last week at the age of 87. Boraine was most famously known for proposing the TRC. He served alongside Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu as co-chair of the TRC from 1996 to 1998. Tutu applauded Boraine’s work, especially his organisational skills during the commission. The Archbishop also called on South Africans to remember the life and work of Boraine as they owe him a great debt of gratitude. During Boraine’s career he interacted with people from different walks of life, which is reflected by those in attendance. Watch a related video below:
