Political parties have called on Parliament to move swiftly to fill the vacancies on the SABC board, after President Cyril Ramaphosa accepted the resignations of four board members on Thursday. This brings the total number of vacancies among the 12 non-executive board members to eight. Democratic Alliance  (DA) spokesperson on communications Phumzile van Damme says Parliament’s Communications Committee must urgently advertise the new vacancies on the SABC board. “The resignation of these board members is most unfortunate. It would have been desirable for board members to stay on board and work together to fix the dire financial crisis facing the SABC which has now been exacerbated by the legal interference of the new communications minister.” “We will now be writing to the chair of the committee requesting that the vacancies be immediately advertised.” WATCH RELATED VIDEO BELOW:
