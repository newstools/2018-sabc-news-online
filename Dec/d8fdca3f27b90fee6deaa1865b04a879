Three people, including a two year-old child, have been burnt to death during a fire that engulfed about 14 shacks at Talana Hostel in the Tzaneen CBD in Limpopo. It’s suspected that the fire, which started in the early hours of Saturday, was caused by a candle. The affected shacks have been built inside an old hall at the hostel. Two other people died in a similar incident two years ago. Mopani District Mayor Nkakareng Rakgoale says government has secured land to build houses for qualifying Talana residents. She says: “The local municipality has managed to secure land to build low cost houses to accommodate these people because this is not a safe place. Some of the people here are foreign nationals.”
