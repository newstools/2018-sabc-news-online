Author and Columnist Max du Preez has come under the spotlight following his views on the role and responsibility that media needs to play in society. In an opinion piece titled ‘Responsible media think deeply about their role in society’, du Preez criticises media ethics, saying journalists and editors need to decide who and what to broadcast and what needs to be given prominence. His views follow another opinion piece he published a week ago, where du Preez openly criticised the media on its coverage of an Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) press briefing outside the State Capture Commission in Johannesburg. During that media briefing, EFF leader Julius Malema questioned the integrity of the commission and accused some senior journalists of showing bias towards Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan and President Cyril Ramaphosa. Du Preez subsequently called for a ban of all future EFF live broadcasts, terming Malema’s utterances as “blatant lies and threats against the media”. The columnist further appealed to the media to stand firm on facts and guard against airing defamatory views from politicians. In light of du Preez’s sentiments, SABC News wants to hear your thoughts and opinions on whether politicians should be given free rein on TV and radio during live coverage.
