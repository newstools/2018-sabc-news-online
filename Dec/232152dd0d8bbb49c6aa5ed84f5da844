Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane says she welcomes anyone who wishes to challenge her findings in court. This as Western Cape Premier, Helen Zille, vows to take Mkhwebane’s findings on review. Mkhwebane has found that Zille violated the executive members’ code of ethics. This after Zille facilitated her son’s company to utilise its software and educational resources through the use of tablets during recent revision workshops for learners. Mkhwebane found this to be in conflict of interest on Zille’s part. However, Zille who plans to approach the High Court in Cape Town explains what she thinks is behind the Public Protector’s findings against her. “I don’t agree with her findings, and I am obviously very puzzled by them. The only thing I can think of is that she was trying to find some kind of equivalence between Fikile Mbalula’s trip to Dubai which almost cost a million rand, with the trip for him and his family and the money they had when they went there, and my son giving free workshops to disadvantaged students to help them prepare for matric in Khayelitsha,” says Zille.
