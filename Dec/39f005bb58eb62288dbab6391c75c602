Former Finance Ministers Pravin Gordhan,  Nhlanhla Nene and former directors General Lungisa Fuzile and Lesetja Kganyago still have to account for what went wrong with the Integrated Financial Management Systems at National Treasury. This is according to SCOPA chairperson Themba Godi in an interview with SABC News in Parliament. Godi reflected on some of the departments and entities that appeared before SCOPA this year. A forensic investigation found that various service providers were given irregular contracts and received irregular payment in the IFMS project. The project has been in progress since 2009 aimed at improving the administration of government. However, Godi says over R2 billion has been spent by Treasury on a project that never came off the ground. “During the political time of Gordhan and Nhlanhla Nene, that’s where these maleficence happened. And we don’t get a record of them having ever intervened or monitored or done anything to safeguard the process. It’s almost like it was on auto pilot. The forensic audit report done by the company done called Nexus,-  almost 500 pages, is very detailed. The DG is going to process that and decide on a course of action. Now in that course of action, I think there is where we will be coming in and say where is political accountability for this, where is the accountability of the accounting officers at that time.  From Fuzile Lungisa to Lesetja Kganyago. Those were the people with whom this project started and it is under their watch that a lot of these things went wrong.”
