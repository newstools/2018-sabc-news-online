Thereâ€™s a gridlock on the N4 toll road in Mpumalanga towards the Lebombo Border Post with Mozambique, where a queue of more than 20 kilometres has formed and impatient motorists are driving on the wrong side towards oncoming traffic.  Traffic officials are hard at work trying to sort out the congestion. Thousands of migrant workers and holidaymakers are trying to cross into Mozambique. Mpumalanga authorities say more traffic officials are being deployed.
