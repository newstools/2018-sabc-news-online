Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema has donated a tractor to community members at Seshego near Polokwane in Limpopo. The tractor donated to the entire community, will help with ploughing. Malema, who hails from Seshego Zone 1, has also donated blankets and food parcels to the community as part of his annual Christmas holidays celebrations. Malema has also encouraged the youth to register to vote in 2019’s elections. He says his party is committed to helping those in need of land. “Well, the land issue is No. 1. Our people need the land – that is why today (Thursday) here we handed over the tools that work the land. We are committed to giving the seeds; we are committed to give them the tools to work the land and that is what we are dealing with – and the second issue is jobs. Our people need jobs.” One of the people who received the gifts says, “We are so grateful to Julius Malema. We’d like to see him continue doing to the good work he is doing. We are very proud of him. We are even emotional. We raised him very well. We hope he extends his help to other people.” With the New Year fast approaching, Malema took time to wish all citizens well. “Well fellow South Africans, let us enjoy the new year responsibly; let us cross into 2019 as people who are prepared to confront the challenges that lie ahead of us. We must not be cowards. We must be well prepared to take head on 2019. The young people must go out in their numbers to register to vote for the EFF.” Some of the key issues Malema spoke about focused on social grants, where he said grants for recipients need to be increased. He also touched on the VBS Mutual Bank saga, as well as corruption in municipalities. Click below for more on the story:
