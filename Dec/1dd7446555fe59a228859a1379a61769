The Molefe family in Lehurutshe village near Zeerust in the North West are still reeling in shock following a tragic crash at the weekend in which 13 passengers, some of them part of the family were killed. They died in a collision between a minibus taxi and a bakkie on the R49 road on Sunday morning. The 22 passengers in the mini-bus taxi were family delegates on their way to Itsoseng to negotiate for lobola. A representative of the Molefe’s, Gaongalelwe Mafora, says following the tragic incident, there is a need for counselling for the remaining family members. “Counselling is really needed to the husband, the children and the rest of the relatives who are affected by the accident,” says Mafora.
