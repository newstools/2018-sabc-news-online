Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta has pledged to increase his government’s budget towards educating the youth to 30%, making it the highest on the African continent. Kenyatta made the pledge via a video message played at the Global Citizen Festival at the FNB Stadium in Johannesburg on Sunday. The concert honours the centenary of Nelson Mandela and aims to end extreme poverty by 2030. The campaign generated a whopping R15 billion in pledges, which will be administered through the United Nations or local initiatives. Kenyatta’s message was played on screen: “This year, I pledge to you my fellow global citizens that in Kenya our education budget will be closer to 30% of our total budget making it probably the highest on the African continent.”
