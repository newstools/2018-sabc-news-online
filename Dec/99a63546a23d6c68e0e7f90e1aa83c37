A manhunt is underway for the occupants of a car that opened fire on Johannesburg Metro Police officers on Wednesday night while attempting to evade a roadblock. A JMPD officer is in a stable condition in hospital after being shot in the shoulder. JMPD Spokesperson Wayne Minnaar says these attacks are common but unacceptable, as an attack on police is an attack on the residents of the city. “A white BMW car that was being chased by other officers for avoiding a roadblock in Doornfontein was approaching a second roadblock on Smith Street Braamfontein when the female officer got shot, as officers attempted to stop the BMW. The Chief of JMPD commended the officer for being brave and there is still a search for the white BMW, which had failed to stop.”
