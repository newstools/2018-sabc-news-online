President Cyril Ramaphosa is to appoint a panel to advise him on how to rebuild the country’s intelligence services.  This is according to a report of Parliament’s Joint Standing Committee on Intelligence for the 2017 and 2018 financial year. In the report, the committee has raised several concerns, including tensions between the office of the Inspector-General for Intelligence and the intelligence community. There are also concerns about the use of the intelligence secret account. The Joint Standing Committee on Intelligence (JSCI) says it is wants an investigation into the Principal Agent Network, a project it says was used as an instrument to steal money. The committee says this matter has not been properly investigated. It has, therefore, persuaded the president to reopen it for investigation and prosecution. The report also raises concerns about the fraught relationship between the office of the Inspector General and the Intelligence Community. The JSCI says there needs to be an overarching assessment of the entire intelligence community to make it efficient and professional.
