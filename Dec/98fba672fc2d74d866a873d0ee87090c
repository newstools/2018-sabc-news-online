President Cyril Ramaphosa has welcomed the North Gauteng High Court judgment upholding the President’s dismissal of Tom Moyane as Commissioner of the South African Revenue Service (SARS). The court dismissed Moyane’s application to overturn his axing with punitive costs on Tuesday. Ramaphosa dismissed Moyane in November following a recommendation by the Nugent Commission of Inquiry into governance of SARS. Moyane has said he will appeal today’s judgment. President Ramaphosa’s spokesperson Khusela Diko says:”The president says that today’s judgement, which dismisses Mr Moyane’s application with punitive costs is a step towards stabilising SARS.” “This is particularly important to ensure that efficient tax revenue and tax justice, which is vital to economic recovery, is restored, and most importantly the confidence of corporate and personal tax payers in this very important public institution.” “So in line with the recommendations of the Nugent commission the president will soon initiate a process to appoint a new SARS commissioner.” Click video below:  Handing down the judgment, Judge Hans Fabricius said Moyane’s interdict was not urgent and that his application has been an abuse of the court’s processes. He said the Nugent commission was legally established and its interim report which recommended Moyane’s axing was legally issued. Judge Fabricius said that President Cyril Ramaphosa acted rationally when he fired Moyane.
