The Hawks say they are optimistic that the arrest of a magistrate in Carltonville west of Johannesburg will send a message that no one is above the law. The magistrate, who was arrested on Thursday, faces charges of corruption and extortion. This was after he allegedly demanded a bribe from two suspects who had been arrested for theft last week. The Carletonville Magistrate allegedly approached the suspects’ colleague and demanded that the two females pay an amount and they will be released on their next court appearance. The Hawks then assessed the alleged intentions of the Magistrate and later arrested him in a sting operation. National Head of the Hawks Lieutenant General Godfrey Lebeya says while everyone is considered innocent until proven otherwise, those who preside over cases in court are expected to conduct themselves in an exemplary manner. The magistrate is expected to appear at the Carletonville Magistrate’s Court on Monday.
