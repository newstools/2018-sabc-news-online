The SABC Group Executive for Human Resources Jonathan Thekiso and SABC’s legal representative from Werksmans Attorneys, Sandile July, have given further clarity regarding the alleged flouting of tender regulations and processes by members of the former interim board. On Sunday former Head of Supply Chain Management at the SABC, Simon Mulaudzi said the former SABC interim board awarded a R185 million security tender to the second highest ranking bidder Mafoko Security. This is despite the highest ranking bidder Mjayeli Security being cheaper by almost R2 million. Mjayeli Security has since challenged this in court. Mulaudzi and former SABC General Manager of Supply Chain Governance  Ayanda Mkhize claim they were fired on trumped up charges. Sandile July confirms that there were hearings for the two former employees. He also says that Mulaudzi and Mkhize were not the only two employees that were charged. “They are not the only employees who were charged that is not true. One of the employees that was charged, who was the acting CFO who signed two documents one being a pre-payment for R4.5 million was charged and when the time came for a disciplinary hearing she resigned,” says July. Meanwhile, Jonathan Thekiso says they can confirm that the sixth employee who has been linked to allegations of sexual harassment at the public broadcaster has been suspended. WATCH BELOW:  Tebogo Malatji MD of Malatji Kanyane Inc who represents former interim board members, has said there is no link between the resignations and the awarded security tender. It is alleged that the four members of the interim board that resigned, Khanyisile Kweyama, Krish Naidoo, John Mattison and Mathatha Tsedu might be linked to the irregularly awarded tender. WATCH  TEBOGO MALATJI BELOW:  In a statement the former SABC interim board has defended its decision, saying the awarding of the tender was taken in the best interest of the corporation based on facts and legal advice. It has also emphasized that the recent resignations have nothing to do with the tender. The statement further said the score difference between Mjayeli and Mafoko was very small and that the SABC could still have negotiated a lesser price with Mafoko Security.
