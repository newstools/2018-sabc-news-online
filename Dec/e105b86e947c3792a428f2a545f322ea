The former personal lawyer and fixer for President Donald Trump, Michael Cohen has been sentenced to a three year prison term after pleading guilty to a series of crimes including lying to Congress and campaign finance violations. Cohen becomes the first person from the President’s inner circle to be sentenced as part of broader investigations led by Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller into the conduct of the President himself. Before sentencing Cohen said he took full responsibility for his crimes for each act that he pleaded guilty to – the personal ones and those involving the President of the United States. He referred to his blind loyalty to Trump that led him to take a path of darkness instead of light. He also said he felt it was his duty to cover up the President’s dirty deeds. District Judge William Pauley called each of the crimes a serious offence against the United States, saying Cohen pleaded guilty to a veritable smorgasbord of fraudulent conduct. Cohen has famously once said that he would take a bullet for Trump, but since being swept up in the Mueller probe he began cooperating with federal prosecutors investigating Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Moscow.
