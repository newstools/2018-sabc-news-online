Women have urged government to prioritise them in the distribution of land when it implements its land expropriation without compensation plans. They were speaking during the Women Dialogue, organised by the Progressive Women’s Movement of South Africa in Durban, as part of 16 days of activism. Women discussed various topics including land, women in food security, gender-based violence and social ills. The National Convenor of the Progressive Women’s Movement of South Africa, Hlengiwe Mkhize says to address food security, government needs to allow women to have access to land. “Now there is clarity into the direction the country is taking in terms of ensuring that those who were dispossessed as far back as 1913 they have access to land. In a country like ours majority of people are women so we do not want gender neutral policies, if its gender neutral then it means women will not benefit. We want the gender responsive distribution of land and assistance and empowerment to make sure that those women are in production immediately.” A female commercial farmer, Maureen Magubane has urged the people to refrain from protesting for basic services such as toilets and houses but instead unite and fight for the distribution of land to women in order to benefit the next generation.
