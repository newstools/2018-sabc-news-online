Police Minister Bheki Cele has announced Lieutenant-General Nhlanhla Mkhwanazi as the new provincial police commissioner of KwaZulu-Natal. Mkhwanazi takes over from Mmamonnye Ngobeni who resigned after a year on suspension. Ngobeni has taken early retirement. She had been suspended after being investigated for corruption. Mkhwanazi has been holding a similar position in an acting capacity for the past six months. He  has also worked with the Police Special Task Force Unit. Cele says he hopes the appointment will bolster crime fighting efforts in the province and that it is a relief to have a permanent head of police in the province finally. Both men have a history of working together dating back to the days when Cele was a National Police Commissioner. “We have decided to appoint the permanent provincial commissioner of the province of KwaZulu-Natal, which happens to be Lieutenant-General Mkhwanazi. We do not speak about the acting provincial commissioner. We have a provincial commissioner. He will be taking matters forward,” says Cele. Meanwhile, Mkhwanazi says one of his priorities will be to tackle political killings, housebreakings and car hijacking. “I think as part of the management of the province, since I came here what I realised is what we’ve been talking about … that we need to find crime that causes fear to the public. We know the crime of murder, the crime of house robberies, hijackings … those are the priorities that we need to focus on.” Mkhwanazi is expected to hit the ground running with hijacking, white collar crime and house robberies on the increase. He will also have his hands full dealing with crimes related to the festive season such as drunken driving.
