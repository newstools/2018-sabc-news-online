The Democratic Alliance’s (DA) spokesperson on Communications, Phumzile van Damme, says she hopes the reported resignation of two South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) board members – John Mattison and Khanyisile Kweyama – is not linked to the Special Investigating Unit’s (SIU) investigation into the awarding of an irregular tender. In a statement, Van Damme says that a security tender worth R185 million was awarded by the public broadcaster’s interim board in 2017. Van Damme also says she is concerned about what she says may be an attempt by the African National Congress (ANC) led government to force the collapse of the new independent SABC board. However, the ANC has denied this while Van Damme has detailed her concerns about the tender matter. “The tender was awarded to a company by the interim board in 2017 despite being ranked second in the bidding process. The interim board allegedly overruled its own supply chain management processes, ignored Treasury and its own lawyers. The SIU has since investigated the tender and found that it was awarded irregularly and there was misconduct,” says Van Damme. Watch related video below:
