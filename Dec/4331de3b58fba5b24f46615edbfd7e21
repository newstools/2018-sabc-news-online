A new poll by  the Institute of Race relations (IRR) suggests that 69% of all South Africans will vote in next year’s election. The report covers the results of a “snap poll” revealing telling shifts in support for South Africa’s main political parties. It shows that ANC would get around 59% of the vote, the DA 22% and the EFF 10%.  It also said that the ANC could get below 50% in Gauteng opening the door for coalitions. The Head of Politics and Governance at the Institute of Race Relations (IRR), Gareth van Onselen explains, “The overwhelming trend is that there is swinging support towards the ANC and in the other direction swinging support away from the DA and the EFF, in particular. “But once you distinguish the DA from the EFF, the EFF still comes out above of what it was in 2014 with 10 or 11%.  The DA seems to be down from its 2014 figure which will be a great concern to that party,” van Onselen explained. https://t.co/UazhtFAQmd — Gareth van Onselen (@GvanOnselen) December 10, 2018  CLICK ON INTERVIEW: <a href="https://iono.fm/e/635446">Content hosted by iono.fm</a>
