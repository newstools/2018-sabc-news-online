The ANC in Gauteng has sent its condolences to the family of former senior party official Khabisi Mosunkutu. He died on Monday at the age of 69. The cause of death has not yet been revealed but he had not been well after he suffered a stroke last year. Mosunkutu resigned from the provincial legislature in 2011 after more than a decade as a member of the executive in various portfolios. He was one of the founding members of labour federation Cosatu and is the former general-secretary and president of the Post and Telecommunications Workers Union. Gauteng ANC spokesperson Tasneem Motara says: “Comrade Mosunkuthu had not been well for some time and sadly succumbed to his illness. We send out condolences to his family and friends especially his wife. On a day when family and friends should be gathered enjoying peace and harmony, his friends and family will sadly be mourning his passing. Our thoughts and prayers go with them at this very difficult time.”
