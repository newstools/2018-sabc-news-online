Deputy President and chairperson of the South African National AIDS Council, David Mabuza, has encouraged South Africans to get tested for HIV. In his message to South Africans on World AIDS Day, Mabuza stressed the importance of knowing one’s HIV status and supporting those who are already living with HIV. The theme for this World AIDS Day is “Know your Status”. The main event will be held in Dobsonville in Soweto. Mabuza has encouraged South Africans to remember those who have died because of HIV-related illnesses. He adds, “We want to take this opportunity to call on all our citizens to check impilo and know their status. This year we also call upon all South Africans to action, to take responsibility for their health and wellness by knowing their status and being linked to treatment and care. Lets work together to make our actions count. Check impilo, know your status.”
