Former City of Cape Town mayor, Patricia de Lille, has announced that the name of her new political party is ‘Good’. The party is expected to contest the 2019 elections in all provinces. The announcement comes after De Lille resigned from her position as the city’s first citizen and as Democratic Alliance member last month. The new political party will be officially launched in January next year. De Lille made the announcement at a media briefing in Johannesburg on Sunday. ” The name will simply be Good. It is a very simple but authentic name that says quite boldly what we stand for and we are here to disrupt politics as usual. Good is a movement there to uphold the constitution and one that cares about our people. We need to nurture the frail, educate the young people and help those that are suffering and the most needy.” About two weeks ago, she announced that she would start a new political party which would contest the 2019 elections.
