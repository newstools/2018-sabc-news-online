The bail hearing of two men accused of the murder of seven family members in Vlakfontein south of Johannesburg is on Wednesday expected to resume in the Protea Magistrateâ€™s Court in Soweto. Ernest Mabaso and Fita Khupe face seven counts of murder. Mabaso faces additional charges of theft, robbery and three counts of rape. Three women and four children were found murdered and their bodies buried in a heap of sand at their home in Vlakfontein. The investigating officer in the case, Banele Ndlovu, is expected to return to the stand to complete his testimony. Last week the court heard that there was no direct evidence linking one of the murder accused to the alleged murder weapon. Watch video below:
