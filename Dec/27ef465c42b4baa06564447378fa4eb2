The Cango Wildlife Ranch in Oudtshoorn in the Little Karoo, is celebrating a baby boom this festive season. The facility has welcomed a baby lemur, Egyptian geese and a baby flying fox to their family. The main attraction has been six fluffy and cute cheetah cubs. The births of the cheetah cubs are especially being celebrated, this is mainly due to its dwindling numbers. Only around 7000 of these vulnerable cats exist in the wild today. Their breeding programme has been so successful, that conservationists from around the world sign up. Since 1986, around 300 cheetah cubs have been born at the facility. Watch a related video below:
