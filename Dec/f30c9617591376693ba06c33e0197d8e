Eligible voters without proof of physical address could be allowed to vote after the passing of the Electoral Laws Amendment Bill by the National Assembly. Among others, the Bill aims to prevent the possible challenge of election results in court based on the absence of addresses on the voters’ roll. The amendment follows a 2016 Constitutional Court ruling that ordered the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) to have a record of voters’ addresses, after the outcomes of the 2013 by-elections in Tlokwe were challenged. The Minister of Home Affairs, Siyabonga Cwele, says the amendment makes provision for voters whose addresses are not on the voter’s role to vote. “On election day, such a voter may present herself to the voting station, be given a form on which to record her address before being issued with both provincial and national ballots. For those persons where it is impossible to provide address, those persons will get national ballots,” says Cwele. The Bill has been sent to the National Council of Provinces for concurrence.
