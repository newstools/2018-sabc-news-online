Former President Jacob Zuma will know on Thursday whether he will have to personally pay for costs related to his fraud, corruption, money laundering and racketeering case or not. The High Court in Pretoria will hand down judgment on the Democratic Alliance (DA) and Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) application to have the agreement authorising state funding for Zuma’s defence in criminal cases set aside. The DA and the EFF have asked the court for a declaratory order that it was illegal to pay Zuma’s legal fees and to order the state attorney to determine how much money was paid in the process and then recover it from the former president. In November, the High Court in Pretoria dismissed Zuma’s bid to appeal a costs order made against him in his personal capacity when he approached the court to review the State of Capture report by former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela.
