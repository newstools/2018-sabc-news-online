The African National Congress (ANC) has retained ward nine during Wednesdayâ€™s by-election in the Witzenberg Municipality near Ceres in the Western Cape. The ward became vacant after the resignation of the ANC councillor. Candidates from the ANC, Democratic Alliance (DA), Congress of the People (COPE) and the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) contested the by-election. ANC candidate Mxolisi Ndaba secured nearly 50% of the votes. The percentage poll was just over 37%. The by-election was initially scheduled to take place last month but was postponed after a number of political parties complained that they had no reasonable access to potential voters for campaigning purposes.
