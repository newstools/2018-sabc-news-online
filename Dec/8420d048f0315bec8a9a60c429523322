The South African Federation of Trade Unions (SAFTU) General Secretary Zwelinzima Vavi says Members of Parliament deserve a salary increase which is below inflation. Vavi says President Cyril Ramaphosa took the right decision not to give public representatives the 4% that was recommended by the Independent Commission for the Remuneration of Public Office Bearers. Members of Parliament such as the National Assembly Speaker, her deputy, the National Council of Provinces (NCOP) chairperson and her deputy will receive a 0% increases for the 2018/2019 financial year. However the rest of MPs in the National Assembly and NCOP permanent delegates will all get a 2, 5 % increases backdated to the 1st of April this year. Vavi says it a good move… “The 2.5 % is below the rate of inflation, and it’s a signal that says people are going through the very difficult times in the economy, and that their MPs can’t continue to live in the ivory towers while so many millions of our people are unemployed and/or earning poverty wages that will make this period even more stressful. They can see what is happening in the neighbourhood – and whilst they can’t even buy their kids the clothing and they can’t buy them all of the good things we normally buy during the festive season.”
