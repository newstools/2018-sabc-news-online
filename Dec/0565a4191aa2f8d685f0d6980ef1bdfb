The family of South African paramedic Mark Roxburgh, who died in a helicopter crash in the United Arab Emirates at the weekend, say they are overwhelmed by the support they’ve been receiving from across the world. Condolences have been pouring in, including from the Department of International Relations and Co-operation. Roxburgh’s sister, Lindy-Lee Felix says, “He was very easy to like and from what I’ve learnt only now from this horrible incident is how many people held him in such high favour and that has been very humbling to see how many people have been affected by him.” “I think the support we’ve received in the last, gosh; it hasn’t even been 24 hours, just been really phenomenal. I’m so grateful that there are those who shared some beautiful words with us, some beautiful memories with us, and I’m proud to say that I’m his sister,” adds Lee Felix.
