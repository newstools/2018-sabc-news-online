A 30 year old woman has been arrested for allegedly killing her four children in Klarinet at Emalahleni in Mpumalanga. Police spokesperson, Leonard Hlathi says community members have told them the children, aged between 11 months and 8 years, were last seen last week on Wednesday. He says the suspect handed herself over after police went to the scene to investigate. Hlathi further says a postmortem will be conducted to determine the cause of deaths. “When they arrived at the scene, they found these bodies on the bed – and it seemed as if all the children had started to decompose. The mother of these children, a 30 year old woman, has already handed herself over at the police station. This is now a matter of investigation, we have already charged her with four counts of murder. We cannot currently determine the causes of death, which will be done once the postmortem has been conducted,” says Hlathi. See related tweets below:
