The Automobile Association (AA) says it’s too early to speculate whether the significant drop in fuel prices is a sign of things to come in 2019. The Department of Energy has announced that from Wednesday a litre of petrol will cost R1.84 less, while diesel will decrease by R1.45. This comes as a relief to South Africans as fuel prices increases over the past year were 22%. AA spokesperson Layton Beard has cautioned that South Africans should still spend wisely during the festive season, as fuel hikes could be a possibility in the new year. “So great we’ve got a decrease now, but are we going to see another increase in January? Look, it’s really early days… if the trend continues as we keep those levels at where we are the moment, in other words the rand remains firm against the greenback, international petroleum prices remain low… then I think it could be even biter news going into January. “In the sense of we [are] not going to have another increase, we could see a very small decrease then as well. Again, though it’s very speculative right now, we have to wait and see what happens going into the new year,” adds Beard.
