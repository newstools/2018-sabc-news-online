The Department of Rural Development and Land Reform has allocated more than R100 million towards developing small commercial farmers in the uMlalazi District Municipality near Eshowe in northern KwaZulu-Natal. Acting Director-General Rendani Sadiki has signed a memorandum of agreement with developing farmers who have formed a cooperative known as the South African Farmers’ Development Association (Safda). Sadiki says the funds will assist the farmers with fertiliser and the transportation and marketing of their produce. “We further agreed that Safda would also assist the department to establish farmers support production units. This is expected to create thousands of jobs and revival of small medium and micro rural enterprises over the next 10 years. I am here to sign a 10 year memorandum of agreement with the executive of Safda Dr Madlala where the department will make funds available for immediate intervention to assist farmers in distress.”
