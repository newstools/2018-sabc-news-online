The Joburg Metropolitan Police Department (JMPD) has launched an internal investigation into allegations of non-adherence to traffic management plans at the Global Citizen Festival held at FNB stadium over a week ago. This comes after many concert goers were attacked and robbed outside the concert venue. Police say about 50 incidents were reported to them. The JMPD says the investigation seeks to ensure that they get to the bottom of what happened. Johannesburg Public Safety MMC Michael Sun still insists that the metro police were only responsible for traffic management. Sun says: “We are trying to get information from other stakeholders. We definitely want to make sure that the JMPD are able to get to the bottom of these incidents and of course learn the valuable lessons in order to improve our next major event in the city. We do not want to point fingers and shift responsibility.”
