The City of Joburg says more than R80-million worth of counterfeit goods have been confiscated in Johannesburg in a month. Mayor Herman Mashaba has released the crime statistics for the month of November. He says the monthly stats will help to inform residents about crime patterns, the most affected areas and what the City is doing about it. Mashaba has added that most crimes in the city are funded by money from fake goods. “Those who are profiting from counterfeit goods have upped their game… in addition to mass producing of fake goods like clothing and shoes, these criminals have now moved in to produce fake medicines – including ARVs and Panado – in fact our JMPD officers shutdown two makeshift drug labs in Fordsburg in the east of JHB recently. In just two years, JMPD uncovered goods worth R250-million,” says Mashaba. Watch video below for more:
