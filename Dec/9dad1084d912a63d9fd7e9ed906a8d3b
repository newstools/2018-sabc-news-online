Finance Minister Tito Mboweni has re-appointed Mark Kingon as South African Revenue Service (SARS) Acting Commissioner for three months. National Treasury says Kingon will continue to act until a new Commissioner for SARS is appointed by the President. The Presidency has announced that the process to appoint the new Commissioner is currently underway. This after the High Court ruled against former SARS boss Tom Moyane’s application to prevent President Cyril Ramaphosa appointing the new head of SARS. Economist Azar Jaminne has urged government to appoint Kingon. “I find it strange that an Acting Commissioner should be appointed for a third consecutive term without being made a permanent appointment. Mark is experienced, having been on the job for 20 years. One doesn’t know why he is not appointed permanently.” “At least there will be an experienced mind heading SARS for another three months or so,” adds Jaminne.
