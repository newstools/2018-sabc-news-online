Four municipalities invested a combined R314 million. The affected municipalities are the provincial capital Mahikeng, Dr Ruth Segomotsi Mompati District at Vryburg, Madibeng at Brits and Moretele near Hammaskraal. Premier Mokgoro says: “We initiated forensic investigations and on the basis of the outcome we have given various directives. In Madibeng and Mahikeng we have taken action by suspending the municipal managers.”
