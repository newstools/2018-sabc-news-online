South Africa is continuing its for push for the lifting of sanctions which have been imposed on Cuba. This is the message from the South African delegation currently on the north Caribbean island. Cubaâ€™s economy is slow due to a US trade embargo. Cuba is an ally of South Africa and a friend of all former frontline states. It is also a trusted friend of Africa and socialist countries. All former South African Presidents visited Cuba after taking office. The two countries are commemorating the deaths of their founding fathers Nelson Mandela and Fidel Castro. Castro was cremated and his ashes were buried in 2016. The South African delegation is attending the commemorative activities of both Mandela and Castro. Fidel Castro led his country to freedom. He was a socialist who had both friends and enemies. The United States imposed sanctions on Cuba decades ago. The relationship between Havana and Pretoria continues to be cordial. South Africa says if it gets back its non-permanent seat on the Security Council, it will continue to lobby for the lifting of sanctions on Cuba.
