The Durban’s Municipality Festive Season Management Committee (FESMAC) says they have taken in over 80 lost children a day at the Durban Beach front since the start of the holidays. About 700 children have since been reunited with their parents. Now, with an influx of visitors expected in Durban ahead of the New Year celebrations, FESMAC operations manager Malcom Canham says parents need to be more vigilant. He says parents should also put wrist bands on their children, to make it easy for them to be reunited if they wander off. “Thus far we’ve had quite a few children separated and we’ve taken them into our overnight school where we house them but we have nobody remaining so the system works very well to reunite parents with their children. What we have along the beach front is separated children’s tent so if a child is separated from their older siblings or their parents they are taken to the separated children’s tent. It’s been very good while we’ve had a high number going through the tents sometimes 87 in a day that number is reduced so numbers taken to the school might be down to seven in one day so it varies per day.”
