Johannesburg Water has denied reports that a sewage leak has contaminated water in the Coronationville area. This is in response to messages that have been circulated on social media, urging residents to boil their water before using it. Johannesburg Water spokesperson, Isaac Dhludhlu explains, “We have no record of such and nobody has come through to report such to us. We have contacted the councillors that have sent that message because they claim that a certain radio station has also informed their listeners about that incident. However, we are still trying to establish the truth, until such a time, it remains fake news.”
