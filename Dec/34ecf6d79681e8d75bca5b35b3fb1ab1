Three men convicted for the cash heist at the O.R Tambo International Airport last year, will serve between 15 and 25 years in jail. The High court in Johannesburg found that the men acted out of greed and showed no remorse for their crimes. Job Mnisi, a former maintenance technician who provided insider information to the armed gang, was convicted only in the conspiracy charge and sentenced to 15 years. Prince Dube, a mechanic by trade, received the heftiest sentence of 25 years, also for his role in the armed robbery. Watch video below:
