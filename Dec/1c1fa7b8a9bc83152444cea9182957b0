The SABC’s former Head of Supply Chain Management, Simon Mulaudzi, says he is ready to take the public broadcaster to the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA) over his dismissal. Mulaudzi was dismissed in October and has numerous allegations levelled against him. He has come out against the SABC accusing its former interim board of flouting tender processes and regulations. He said the 2017 interim board awarded a R185 million security tender to the second highest ranking bidder Mafoko Security. The highest ranking bidder, Mjayeli Security was almost R2 million cheaper. Mjayeli Security has challenged the decision in court. Mulaudzi says the charges against him are false. “There were ten charges that were levelled against me. I was more than prepared to defend myself against those charges. There was a first date that I was given which had 4 charges. I went to attend and defend myself. The SABC did not show up on that first date and instead they gave me the second day, where they had added and of course, they are at liberty to add any other charges. They are trumped up charges. I am ready now to go to the CCMA and prove my innocence.” In an earlier statement the former interim board defended its decision, saying the award of the tender was taken in the best interest of the corporation based on facts and legal advice. It also emphasised that the decision had nothing to do with the latest resignations of SABC board members. WATCH BELOW:  WATCH former SABC General Manager of Supply Chain Governance Ayanda Mkhize:
