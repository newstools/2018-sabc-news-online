The man, who allegedly fled the scene after the bakkie he was driving collided with the motorbike of the spokesperson for the Mpumalanga community safety department, Joseph Mabuza, has been identified. However, Mpumalanga police spokesperson, Leonard Hlathi says the driver has not yet been arrested. Mabuza died on Sunday afternoon when the motorbike he was riding collided with a bakkie on the N4 at Hectorspruit. He had been travelling to Mbombela from a work assignment. Speaking during the funeral service on Sunday, Mpumalanga’s MEC for Community Safety, Security and Liaison Pat Ngomane has called on road users to obey traffic laws. Ngomane says he never thought that the festive season road crashes could claim the life of Mabuza. He described him as a dedicated communicator and a friend. Mabuza’s children, meanwhile say they have leant a lot from their father. Mabuza’s daughter Nthabiseng says their father also taught them to be hard workers.
