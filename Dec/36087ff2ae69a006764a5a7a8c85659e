The United Nations Security Council has called for “a violence-free environment” during the Democratic Republic of Congo’s Presidential elections on Sunday. The Security Council said it has noted with concern recent incidents that resulted in loss of life and significant damage to property. In a statement, the council asked the government to investigate the incidents and urged all political players to uphold the freedom of expression, assembly and unhindered campaigning which are the hallmarks of the democratic exercise of the will of the people. President Joseph Kabila is due to step down after close to two decades in power. Meanwhile clashes between rival ethnic groups in north-western DRC this week have killed dozens of civilians, a local activist and a UN source said on Wednesday. The fighting in Mai-Ndombe province is some of the worst violence to hit the normally peaceful part of the country and comes days before Sunday’s long-delayed presidential election, which many fear could turn violent.
