People living with albinism say they are being discriminated against based on their condition. They say people consider albinism a disability and this makes it difficult for them to be considered for promotions in their workplaces. A group of people living with albinism gathered in Johannesburg to share their experienced of victimisation as part of the 16 Days of Activism for No Violence Against Women and Children. Social Justice Activist – Ingrid Bame, who has been living with albinism, says there’s hardly any room for growth in their jobs. “Before we even talk about them being in the work space, it’s accessing the work space first. People living with albinism are deemed as people who have disabilities because people with albinism are short sighted. So a lot of the time they are roped into learnerships and internships specifically for people that have disabilities. But in that companies or organisations they are trying to make their BEE quota.” Watch related videos:
