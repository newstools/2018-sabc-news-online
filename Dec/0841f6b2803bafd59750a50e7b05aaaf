It is all systems go for the Reconciliation Day celebrations at the Walter Sisulu University Stadium in Mthatha in the Eastern Cape.  President Cyril Ramaphosa is set to deliver his maiden Reconciliation Day keynote address. Locals believe strides have been made towards nation building. A huge marquee has been erected at the stadium, in preparation for the historic day. Some locals are busy cutting grass near the stadium while others are tidying up other areas. Thousands of people will gather at the stadium to listen to the President’s speech. Meanwhile, locals are optimistic. “We learn to live together as one. We don’t have problems of hating one another. We observe one another’s cultures and we live in harmony in the Transkei,” says one of residents on the meaning of the day. Another resident says;” It’s very important to reconcile between black people and white people so that we may forget the squabbles we once had in the past. That will assist in making us unite and become one.” The Arts and Culture Department says it is important for everyone to work towards building unity. “To have this Reconciliation Day is a constant reminder that division based on race, gender, class issues should not and should never be tolerated or any form of division in a society it can only take us back. So this is just to remind South Africans consistently that the past was painful but the future is better, but most importantly that with our diverse cultures and the nature of our South African society we can only thrive if we are united in our diversity,” says Director-General for Arts and Culture, Vusi Mkhize President Cyril Ramaphosa is also expected to open an agricultural project near Ncise village in the Mthatha area before delivering his keynote address.
