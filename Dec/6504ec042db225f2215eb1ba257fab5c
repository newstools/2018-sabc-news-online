The South African Police Service (SAPS) has called on all those who had bad experiences at or after the Global Citizen Festival on Sunday to come forward with information. Incidents of crime were reported after the concert, including fans being robbed of their valuables, and others hijacked. There are also unconfirmed reports that one person was stabbed. SAPS spokesperson Vish Naidoo says security was tight throughout the day at the FNB Stadium in Johannesburg until the festival ended in the early hours of Monday morning. Naidoo says if any SAPS members are found to have abandoned their posts or were in dereliction of duty, action will be taken against them. He adds that one case of robbery was reported at the Sasol garage near the stadium – and a suspect was arrested. “Reports have not been made to us officially. If those reports are made to us officially, it will allow us to investigate.” “They were supposed to remain there until 2am on Monday morning. Whoever is complaining they can send us an email we will investigate. If members did display a gross dereliction of duty, we will make sure that we take the necessary action against them. We cannot go by what is posted on social media… the only time something is factual is if we get an affidavit to warrant an investigation,” adds Naidoo.
