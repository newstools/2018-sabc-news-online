The Hawks have arrested two people for allegedly running a social media tender scam in Limpopo. The man and woman are foreigners and were arrested at their residential flat in Polokwane. Bank receipts, electronic devices, government documents and a book with names of alleged victims were confiscated.  They are accused of defrauding victims of several million rands. The Hawks raided the suspects’ flat in Ladanna in Polokwane on Friday morning. At first the 31-year-old man appeared to be co-operating. However, when Hawks investigators uncovered suspicious items, he became hostile. He denied knowledge of the items, including a notebook containing information, which investigators say belongs to victims. Following a lengthy search of the premises, the two suspects were arrested. According to the Hawks, the two are part of a countrywide syndicate that targets business owners. Victims were allegedly duped into believing they had won tenders to supply various items to government departments. Hawks Spokesperson Captain Matimba Maluleke says, “The suspects allegedly advertised tenders on social media and the tenderpreneurs will just apply for that tender and later receive a quotation. So they will be advised by the very same people to look for another supplier and they will confirm that they have the items that are needed and they will demand a deposit upfront. So they will wait for their money to be deposited by the concerned government department. That’s when they will learn that there was no tender that was advertised.” The suspects charged with fraud will appear in the Polokwane Magistrate’s Court on Monday for fraud.
