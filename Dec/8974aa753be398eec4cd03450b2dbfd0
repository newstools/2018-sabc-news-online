KwaZulu-Natal authorities say at least 15 people were killed at Enseleni near Empangeni on the province’s north coast on Saturday night. The Road Traffic Inspectorate says a minibus collided head on with a car near the off ramp to Richards Bay.  Both vehicles burst into flames on impact. Provincial Transport department spokesperson Mluleki Mtungwa says they will confirm the exact number of the deceased after the MEC has visited the crash scene and received a full report. “Currently, the MEC for Transport Safety and Community Liaison Mxolisi Kauda will be at Empangeni to get information as to what led to the fatal crash. We would like to urge all road users in KZN to be cautious on the road especially that we have entered the very busy period of the festive season. We would like to encourage people to abide by the rules of the road so that we can save lives during this period of the year,” says Mtungwa. Click link for more:
