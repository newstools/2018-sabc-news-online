The Road Accident Fund (RAF) has launched its sixth walk-in centre in Port Elizabeth, which is part of a drive to expand services to accident victims. The new office will add to the existing network of over 100 hospital service centres, five customer service centres and five other walk-in centres throughout the country. The launch co-incides with the festive season and inevitably, hundreds will be injured in accidents on roads during this period. Centres like these aim to ease the process of compensation and fast track accident claims and is the first of its kind in this region. “The walk-in centre is going to be able to assist them in whatever form of query they have, be it they are lodging a new claim or they have lodged their claim already, or want to check the status or even sign an offer,” says Bongiwe Nyengane, Regional Marketing and Communications Manager. The walk-in centre is already operational and centrally placed in the city’s central business district. “I’m very happy with it because they were helpful and it was near to me,” says claimant Elizabeth Welcome. “I got help because they listened to me and they have given me a response now. I’ll be getting medical treatment at a hospital. I’ll also be rehabilitated,” says claimant Joyce Batyi. The centre will also handle claim related queries. The RAF hospital service centres at the Dora Nginza and Livingstone hospitals in the metro also remain operative. WATCH VIDEO BELOW:
