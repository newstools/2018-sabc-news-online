Taking the fight to criminals in rural areas, the police and traditional authorities are joining forces to rid villages of contact crime. The traditional policing concept was launched in Willowvale in the Eastern Cape. Rape, domestic violence, stock theft and murder are crimes that are prevalent in rural areas. Traditional leaders have been battling to get a handle on it. But, it is hoped that the new crime fighting partnership will help them restore their dignity and authority. “It is for the restoration of traditional leadership that we stand to express our gratitude to the ANC led government in SA that we can help government to make people safe,” says Eastern Cape House of Traditional Leaders, Chief Mwelo Nonkonyane. The practice of Ukuthwala and botched circumcisions will also be addressed through this partnership. “We have huge problems about death of initiates. There is an initiate that died here and we don’t know what killed him but we want to get to the bottom of what killed him,” says Amaxhosa King, Zwelonke Sgcawu. Minister of Police Bheki Cele says, “Criminals have no space in our society, solving crime starts with you and me.” Community volunteers will also assist the police in fighting crime. Each of the six kingdoms will get a vehicle for patrols and to make arrests.
