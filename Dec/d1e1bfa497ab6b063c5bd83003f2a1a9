President Cyril Ramaphosa says hate speech is hampering government’s effort to reconcile South Africans. He was delivering the keynote address at reconciliation day celebrations at the Walter Sisulu University Stadium in Mthatha in the Eastern Cape on Sunday. Thousands of people attended the celebrations at the stadium where a huge marquee was erected. Ramaphosa says South Africans should condemn those who are seeking to divide them. “We should stand as one, in condemning those who use all manner of vile names and describe black South Africans, and those who also threaten to kill other people, be it white or black or who insult others, be it for their faith or because of their culture, because of their language or where they come from. We should condemn all those who do such things.” Watch for more:
