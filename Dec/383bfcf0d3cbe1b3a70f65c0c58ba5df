The National Student Financial Aid Scheme (Nsfas) says prospective students whose applications are missing the supporting documents have until Thursday to submit them. The scheme has received over 400 000 applications for funding for next year. However, more than 57 000 of them failed to submit required documents such as certified copies of their identity documents, their parents’ proof of income and a consent form. Nsfas spokesperson Kagisho Mamabolo says, “Our major concern is that we cannot proceed with evaluating these applications without the supporting documents. So it’s very important for us to encourage those that have submitted the applications with missing supporting documents to go on mynsfas portal immediately and submit the missing documents. Failure which will result in their applications not being concluded.”
