The heat wave conditions in large parts of the country’s interior will persist on Thursday and are only expected to ease on Friday. Johannesburg and Pretoria residents face temperatures between 35 and 37 degrees celsius. Temperatures are expected to reach the high 30’s in all inland provinces, and even pass 40 in parts of Limpopo like Phalaborwa and Thohoyandou. People are urged to stay out of the sun between 11am and 3pm. The high temperatures are worsening the drought conditions in central farming areas, leading to fears of poor harvests. Many farmers have not yet planted their crops in the North West and the Free State. In contrast to the rest of the country, severe thunderstorms are expected in parts of KwaZulu-Natal.
