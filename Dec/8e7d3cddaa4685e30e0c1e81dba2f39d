A woman has lost her baby after giving birth in front of the gate of Tshino clinic in the Vuwani area of Limpopo on Thursday. Spokesperson for the Limpopo Health Department Neil Shikwambana says the woman did not find any nurses on duty, as the clinic does not operate on a 24 hours basis. He says, however, nurses should have been on standby for emergencies. “It was reported that there is a woman who on labour unfortunately she could not find nurses there, although that clinic works on a call hour basis, that is when a patient comes in, there would be somebody to assist them – although it does not work for 24 hours. Unfortunately that woman ended up giving birth at the gate of the clinic, and the baby died…. we have actually dispatched a high level team to conduct thorough investigations so that necessary actions are taken.”
