The High Court in Johannesburg has heard that the SABC only found out during an audit process that its former COO Hlaudi Motsoeneng received a success fee of R11.5 million. This is according to Advocate Terry Motau who is arguing on behalf of the public broadcaster that Motsoeneng’s pension fund should not be paid out. The SABC’s pension fund is arguing that there has not been any findings against Motsoeneng and they cannot continue to withhold his funds. The SABC on the other hand is arguing that the allegations of dishonesty are enough for the fund to withhold the payout. Adv Terry Motau says Motsoeneng’s R11.5 million pay out had no legal basis as his contract did not entitle him to receive such a payment. He says the amount was calculated as a percentage of R1.4 billion although he only raised R450 million. He also says Motsoeneng kept the SABC in the dark about the payout until the audit process dug it out. The SABC wants the pension fund to preserve the payout until the relevant case has been concluded. However, the fund is arguing that it wants no part in this matter.
