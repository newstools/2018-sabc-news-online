The Chief of Mvezo and former President Nelson Mandela‘s grandson, Mandla Mandela says Christmas should be a time to lend a helping hand and give to the less fortunate. He hosted a Christmas party with scores of children from Mvezo and surrounding villages outside Mthatha in the Eastern Cape. Mandela urged everyone to uphold Madiba’s legacy. “When we are celebrating during this festive season it is not only for ourselves as a family, but we remember the kids that are in our communities and we celebrate this day with them. Therefore, today (Christmas) we are, as a family, following in those footsteps of this global icon to ensure that we put the kids in these rural communities first and ensure that they too can be able to access the festivities of today  (Christmas) and they can be able to have access to the sweets and nice things that are provided for by our sponsors.” The children were elated as they were treated to a braai and some drinks before they were given gift packs to take home.
