The African National Congress (ANC) has confirmed that a letter of complaint has been received accusing its national spokesperson Pule Mabe of sexual harassment. Mabe’s personal assistant has detailed in the letter two alleged incidents of sexual assault. The ANC says it has now established a Grievance Panel after its spokesperson Pule Mabe was accused of sexual harassment. The SABC understands that the party will hold an internal disciplinary process on Wednesday. In the letter sent to the party, Mabe’s PA says the incidents took place this year, one at the St George’s hotel in Pretoria and another in Limpopo. The party says it will not comment on the substance of these allegations until internal processes have been finalised. The matter has not yet been reported to the police.
