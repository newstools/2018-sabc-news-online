School principal Sibongile Mahlangu says the damage did not disrupt teaching and learning. “It did not disrupt learning and teaching because it came a day before our last examination which takes place in a school hall other classroom but we are feeling like it’s going to affect us going forward if we don’t get help as soon as possible.” Five villages in the Dr JS Moroka Municipality were the worst affected.
