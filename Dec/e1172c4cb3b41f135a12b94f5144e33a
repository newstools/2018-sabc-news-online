Transport Minister Blade Nzimande has launched the road safety awareness and education campaign at Park Station in Johannesburg. Nzimande was accompanied by Gauteng Transport MEC Ismael Vadi, SANTACO president Phillip Taaibosch, leadership of the Road Transport Management Corporation and law enforcement agencies. The campaign will seek to help to reduce the number of road fatalities this festive season. Minister Blade Nzimande engaged with commuters during the launch of the campaign. They started at Park Station before proceeding to Wanderers Taxi Rank which deals with long distance taxis. Nzimande was accompanied by SANTACO president Phillip Taaibosch who engaged with drivers. “We would like to encourage you to take care of our passengers and also to make sure that you take a good rest after every 200 kilometers, so that we all arrive safe and alive. All the best with your journey and safe journey.” Nzimande says they have noted with concern high fatalities on our roads around this season. He has urged commuters to also play part in ensuring that they are safely transported…. “Passengers, don’t just leave it to the driver. Help where you can. If the driver is over speeding, raise about that. Be part of the trip so that we make sure that people arrive wherever they are going safely.”
