Democratic Alliance (DA) MP Mike Waters says he’s laid criminal charges against the SABC and an individual shown on the broadcaster’s 24-hour news TV channel wearing a t-shirt with the words “Kill all white people”. The DA’s deputy chief whip says the individual was wearing the said t-shit whilst being interviewed on one of the SABC news programmes last Friday. Waters says he laid charges at the Boksburg North police station yesterday, as he believes showing the T-shirt violated the country’s Constitution. “I’ve done so in accordance with the Constitution, section 16(2). Section 16(1) allows for freedom of speech but section 16.2 does not allow for the incitement of violence, and the fact that what the t-shirt said to kill all white people was incitement of violence,” adds Waters.
