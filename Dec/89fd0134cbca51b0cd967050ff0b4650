Limpopo premier Stan Mathabatha says criminal cases will be opened against municipal officials implicated in transferring millions of rands in public funds to the now liquidated VBS mutual bank. Ten municipalities in the province have lost a combined R1.2 billion. “We call on law enforcement agencies to support and supplement our efforts in ensuring that justice is done without fear favour or unreasonabl. We want to see arrests, successful prosecutions and serious jail terms for all those who have violated the law. For our part as government we will provide all the necessary support to the law enforcement agencies to bring this matter to finality,” says Mathabatha. Earlier on Tuesday, Mathabatha announced the dismissal of seven Limpopo mayors, including ANC provincial deputy chairperson and Vhembe mayor Florence Radzilani. The seven mayors who have been sacked are mayors of Collins Chabane, Makhado, Lepelle-Nkumpi, Giyani, Fetakgomo-Tubatse, Ephraim Mogale and Vhembe. Radzilani resigned before being fired. She was adamant that her resignation as mayor does not imply that she is guilty of looting the now liquidated VBS Mutual Bank. Radzilani, who is also the ANC Provincial Deputy Chairperson, is implicated in the Reserve Bank report into the looting of VBS. However, she has denied any wrongdoings. Mathabatha emphasised that criminal charges will be laid against anyone suspected of corruption in relation to the VBS saga. Watch Video Below:
