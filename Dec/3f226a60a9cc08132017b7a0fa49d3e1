Zimbabwean authorities say they have not received any formal communication from the South African Government regarding the warrant of arrest for former First lady Grace Mugabe. The permanent secretary in the Zimbabwe Ministry of Information, NickÂ Mangwana, told SABC News that they would only be able to communicate the course of action once they get official communication from South Africa. Former President Robert Mugabe is currently in Zimbabwe after returning from Singapore for a medical check-up. Grace Mugabe was accused of allegedly assaulting a Johannesburg model, Gabriella Engels with an extension cord in Sandton. AfriForum has taken up the case and pursued a private prosecution after she was allowed to leave the country under a diplomatic immunity.  Click video below:
