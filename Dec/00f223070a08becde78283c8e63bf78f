The family of an 81-year-old woman from eMahlabathini in Ulundi is demanding answers. They are accusing the eNkonjeni Hospital of negligence after allegedly prescribing wrong medication for Balindile Ntombela. Ntombela has since died. Ntombela went to the hospital seeking medical care for her sores but two weeks after she visited the institution, her  health deteriorated very quickly. Her family says this is because the hospital’s pharmacy prescribed wrong medication. Ntombela’s family says the pharmacy’s instruction was for the medication to be taken orally three times a day but it was later found that it was meant to be used for bathing. The department says it will investigate. “As soon as the hospital management was made aware of the matter, a doctor and a phamarcy manager were dispatched to the family and they conducted an inspection,” says KZN Department of Health spokesperson, Agiza Hlongwane. The family is contemplating taking legal action against the hospital. Ntombela will be buried next weekend. Watch video below:
