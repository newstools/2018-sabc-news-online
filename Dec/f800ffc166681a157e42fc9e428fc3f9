The SABC is set to suspend more employees on Monday over sexual harassment allegations at the public broadcaster. This follows the Commission of Inquiry into Sexual Harassment. Management has started implementing the recommendations of the Commission. The alleged perpetrators were served with notices to make written submissions as to why their preliminary suspensions should not be made final. Five employees have been suspended. Group Execuitve for human Resources Jonathan Thekiso says they have received a number of new allegations that they are currently investigating, particularly stemming from one provincial office. “There will be another suspension happening on Monday. This is the first phase. This whole process by the commission has essentially awoken people about the fact that the orgnisation will be very very intolerant about issues of sexual harassment and as it is we have seen in the last few days a number of employees approaching the organisation with allegations of sexual harassment. Theres a particular provincial office where we’ve seen a number of allegations being communicated to the organisation particularly to my office in HR and the orgnaisation in this instance has acted very swiftly. ” WATCH BELOW:
