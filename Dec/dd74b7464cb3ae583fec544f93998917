The Congress of the People (Cope), has accused the Public Protector, Advocate Busisiwe Mkhwebane, of dragging her feet in making public the findings of the investigations into the Estina Dairy Farm. In statement issued on Sunday, Cope called the Public Protector’s report just a smokescreen meant to divert the public attention away from more serious investigations like Estina Dairy Farm project in the Free State. Cope points a finger at the former Free State Premier and now Secretary General of the African National Congress (ANC), Ace Magashule and former Minister Msebenzi Zwane. It says the two and the Guptas are highly implicated in that investigation. The party also questioned the reports on Premier Helen Zille and former Minister Fikile Mbalula. Citing what it says would restore order in the Public Protector’s office, the Congress of the People called for Mkhwebane’s resignation. WATCH RELATED VIDEO:
