The South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) says it is in the process of registering complaints against Black First Land First leader (BLF), Andile Mngxitama. This after the Commission received complaints relating to utterances made by Mngxitama at a rally in Potchefstroom, North West, last Saturday. Video footage on social media shows Mngxitama telling the  audience that they will kill white people. “The SAHRC can confirm that we have received complaints against Mr Mngxitama. We are consolidating them and assessing our complaints handling procedure as to what our next step would be,” says SAHRC Spokesperson, Gail Smith. This week, the Freedom Front Plus says it intends to write to the Independent Electoral Commission to request the de-registering of Black First Land First from participating in the 2019 elections. Mngxitama is accused to have incited his members to commit offences. The FF Plus opened a criminal case against Mngxitama at the Potchefstroom Police Station in the North West, for contravening the Rioters Assemblies Act by urging his supporters to kill five white people for every black person killed.
