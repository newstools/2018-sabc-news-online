SABC Board member Krish Naidoo has confirmed to the public broadcaster’s Radio News that he has resigned. However, two other board members who are also said to have resigned, deputy chairperson Khanyisile Kweyama and John Mattison are keeping mum. It’s not yet clear if these developments are a direct result of an acrimonious meeting Communications Minister Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams had with the board last week. At the same time, reports say this might be linked to an irregularly awarded tender that’s under investigation. The board clashed with the minister over its plans to retrench workers. The SABC has this week been denying reports that Group CEO Madoda Mxakwe has also quit.
