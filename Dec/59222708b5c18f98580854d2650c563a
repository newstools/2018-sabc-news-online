President Cyril Ramaphosa will on Friday morning proclaim the effective date for the implementation of the R20 per hour National Minimum Wage at a ceremony at the Walter Sisulu Square in Kliptown, Soweto. This represents a marked increase in income for more than six-million workers or 47% of South Africa’s labour force. President Ramaphosa’s signing of the Minimum Wage followed four years of National Economic Development and Labour Council (Nedlac) deliberations on the protection of low-paid workers and the challenges of labour instability caused by strikes and wage inequality. And after years of persuasion, former Congress of SA Trade Unions (Cosatu) President Sdumo Dlamini says this is victory for the workers. The National Minimum Wage will also provide a platform to reduce inequality and decrease salary disparities in the labour market.  WATCH RELATED VIDEO BELOW:
