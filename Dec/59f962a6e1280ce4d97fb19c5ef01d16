Communications Minister Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams said cyber space safety awareness is everybody’s business, during an inter-ministerial cyber-security and business engagement outreach programme in Mamelodi and Eersterust, east of Pretoria. Ndabeni-Abrahams led a delegation, which was treated to a video on cyber space safety by film students from the Leaders in Motion Academy in Eersterust, and said people should be made aware of the dangers of the internet. She said, “As government we’ve taken a decision that it is high time that people of South Africa participate in a safer space and if we’re to make sure that our people are safe it has to start with the platforms that they communicate from. And cyber space is where they participate, and therefore we made a conscious decision that we will work with everyone who is available to make sure that we can spread the message across to say as much as we tell you of the good of the internet but there is also disadvantages. Which is why we say we’ve got to partner with LIMA and make sure that we come to the community where the people are.” Ndabeni-Abrahams was accompanied by the deputy ministers of Trade and Industry and Small Business and Economic Development.
