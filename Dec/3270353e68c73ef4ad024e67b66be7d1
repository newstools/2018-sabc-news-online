Parliament has sought to explain the process that will be followed leading to the eventual amendment of the Constitution to allow for the expropriation of land without compensation. Earlier on Wednesday, the National Council of Provinces (NCOP) has adopted the report of the Constitutional Review Committee which recommends the amendment of the constitution to facilitate the process. The National Assembly adopted the report on Tuesday. Parliamentary spokesperson Moloto Mothapo explains the process that will be followed leading to the eventual constitutional amendment. “The matter now will require the National Assembly to initiate a process that can be driven by a committee of Parliament. We don’t know what kind of committee decided on that will then work towards action of a bill that would follow a process of development of a beat which includes public education,” says Mothapo.
