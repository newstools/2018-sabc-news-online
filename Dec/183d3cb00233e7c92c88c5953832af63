A man is expected to appear in the Umlazi Magistrateâ€™s Court, south of Durban, in connection with the killing of an ANC councillor in the eThekwini Municipality. Councillor Sibusiso Maphumulo was shot and killed in October this year. An unknown car had stopped and its occupants opened fire on Maphumulo. He sustained gunshot wounds to the head. Before Maphumulo was ambushed community members had allegedly threatened to burn his house after they complained of being left out of some community projects. Two months after the incident, police managed to make a breakthrough and arrested a suspect.
