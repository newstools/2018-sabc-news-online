AfriForum has submitted its proposal for Part B of the lobby group’s court application to set Parliament’s Constitutional Review Committee report on land expropriation without compensation. The full hearing of the case is expected to take place in April 2019. This is according to AfriForum lawyer Willie Spies. The court had ordered that AfriForum and Parliament needed to agree on a date for the Part B hearing and what document is needed to be included for both parties. The organisation has challenged Parliament in the High Court in Cape Town over the committee proceedings. One of its arguments is that close to 180 000 written submissions were excluded from the committee process. Spies elaborates on the contents of the document submitted on Wednesday. “We have submitted our proposal today to the state attorney suggesting certain timelines for the finalisation of part-B of our application. The timelines make provision for the delivery of the full record of the public participation process of the Constitutional Review Committee also for the full record of the committee proceedings that allows for AfriForum to supplement their papers. “It also allows for a process of admitting intervening parties amici curiae (Friends of the Court) to the process in order to make sure that it is a conclusive constitutional legislation or litigation process and then it provides for the setting down of the matter at the first available date after all the time frames has expired. From a rough estimate our expectation is the  matter will be ready for arguments in court early April next year and obviously we are looking forward to a speedy resolve of the whole matter,” says Spies.
