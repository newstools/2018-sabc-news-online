As 16 Days of Activism Against Women and Children Abuse campaign concludes, an Eastern Cape family is happy that justice has been served on two suspects who raped their daughter. Mncedisi Vuba, aged 25 and 30 year-old Xolisa Siyeka were found guilty of rape by the High Court sitting in the Lady Frere magistrate’s court on Tuesday. The incident made headlines when the mother stormed the house in the darkness and unleashed an attack on the perpetrators at Qumbu village outside Lady Frere in 2017. Presiding judge, Mbulelo Jolwana says Siyeka and Vuba tried to mislead the court by not taking responsibility for their actions. “It is clear that they have some point – they have some agreed to sexually violate her – and her dignity as a woman has been dragged to mud. The accused took terms in raping her while she was so drunk that she could not defend herself. Accordingly, accused number one and accused number two have been found guilty of rape.” Meanwhile, the victim’s mother, known as the “lion mama” has welcomed the court verdict. She hopes that the law is tightened to protect all victims of abuse. “I feel so happy and that shows that all the people are not supposed to be abused in any way. I like the fact that these boys who were lying have been found guilty. They were denying everything. The truth came as it is that they are guilty. This is a warning to those who still thinking of raping young girls.”
