Four people have been killed and eleven others injured in a collision between a minibus and a bakkie on the R66 near Ulundi in northern KwaZulu-Natal. EMRS spokesperson Robert McKenzie says the injured have been taken to hospital. He says the crash brings to 25 the number of people killed in road crashes in the province since the weekend. “There was a serious crash in the R66 near uLundi – a crash involving a bakkie and a minibus, tragically the accident resulted in four fatalities. Paramedics treated the 11 patients – the exact cause of the crash is not known and police are investigating the matter.” On Sunday, KwaZulu-Natal Transport MEC, Mxolisi Kaunda has urged motorists to exercise tolerance on the roads this festive season. More than 20 people were killed in two separate crashes in the province over the weekend. 15 people died on Saturday in a head on collision between a minibus and a car near Empangeni on the north coast, while seven people were killed and one injured in an earlier crash on the R614 near Applesbosch in the midlands. Kaunda says all road users need to be alert.  “We need to change our mentality especially the motorist drivers because once we’re able to tap into peoples conscious you touch your own conscious that when you’re on the road you need to be cautious of the fact that you’re not driving alone. So therefore adherence to the road rules must become number one and we’re urging our drivers and our visitors in the province to resist the temptation of just disobeying the road rules. That’s a temptation that happens within seconds and within those seconds we lose lives. So for us to save lives we need drivers who will be cautious.”
