The Right-To-Know Campaign is calling on the new National Director of Public Prosecutions, Shamila Batohi to revive the dropped cases against prominent people including politicians, who have allegedly violated the law. Batohi will take over as head of the NPA from February next year. She was announced as National Director of Public Prosecutions by President Cyril Ramaphosa at the Union Buildings in Pretoria on Tuesday. Batohi becomes the first woman to be the head of the NPA since its inception in 1996 in the Mandela administration. Right-To-Know’s Dale McKinley says: “Some of the cases like Richard Mdluli which has been dropped to the possibility of going after some ex-cabinet ministers that might have been implicated in corruption, fraud and also lying to Parliament. “Also those for example those who falsely represent themselves. She needs to go after high cases and if that includes ex-presidents, well so be it.” “Nobody is above the law in our country and I think that’s what South Africans are expecting,” says McKinley.
