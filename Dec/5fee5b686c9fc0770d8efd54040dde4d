The Congress of SA Trade Unions (Cosatu) president, Zingiswa Losi, has welcomed President Cyril Ramaphosa’s decision not to give Members of Parliament a 4% salary increase. Ramaphosa only allowed a 2.5% increase, which is lower than the across-the-board 4% increase recommended by the Independent Commission for the Remuneration of Public Office Bearers. “We think it is also good that he has done so. Because it is for the very same parliamentarians to really look at the term of office that they have occupied and really tell us for the work that they have done, do they really qualify for the 4% and what has been at the face of ourselves as South Africans? “It is just the drama that has taken place in Parliament. We do know that they do work in committees. But also we think that for the past five years they could have done even better on a number of issues.” “But also, them being people that are dealing with the laws in this country, they must appreciate that we as ordinary South Africans, we have been sitting at home to build this economy and what we have to be confronted with at some point or another, they are also responsible for the laws that have had to be passed through Parliament that would have had a negative impact to the lives of South Africans.”
