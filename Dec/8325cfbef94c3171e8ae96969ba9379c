The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) in Gauteng says Gauteng Premier David Makhura and MEC for Human Settlements, Uhuru Moila have been doing little to help the residents that have been left displaced in Alexandra, north of Johannesburg. Over 2 000 residents in the Greenville informal settlement lost their homes in a fire on Thursday. Some have started rebuilding their homes, while others have made alternative arrangements for accommodation. EFF Chairperson in the province, Mandisa Mashego says Makhura and Moila have disappointed the community. “We had to endure, along with the community, the massive disappointment of Makhura and Uhuru not providing any alternative accommodation or any kind of help whatsoever. Makhura came to Alex and stood around and basically made promises that brought nothing. All the toilets, everything… we had to basically partner with individuals and organisation who were willing to help,” says Mashego. Watch related videos below:
