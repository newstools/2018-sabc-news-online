The proliferation of illegal fire-arms in KwaZulu-Natal is under the spotlight. Police have also blamed private security firms for not complying with the law. These were some issues discussed at a Community Safety crime summit held in Durban this week. KwaZulu-Natal is one of the leading crime-plagued provinces. The province is plagued by political and taxi-related killings, and deadly factional disputes. According to Gun Free South Africa, 23 people are shot and killed in the country every day. Violence monitors say most murders are committed with illegal fire-arms. The proliferation of these fire-arms, the loss and theft thereof, and cross-border trafficking of arms were cited as contributory factors. Pressure groups allege that fraud, corruption and poor enforcement of the law result in unfit people being granted gun licences. Civilians own 3 million of the 5 million registered fire-arms in the country. General Nhlanhla Mkhwanazi Acting KZN Police Commissioner says: “We have realised that there are a lot of I think loopholes in terms of our legislation with regard to the control of firearms that are in the hands of security companies. So if a security company is licenced to own twenty firearms and they don’t control those firearms those firearms end up at the wrong hands and being used in the commission of crime.” WATCH BELOW FOR MORE:
