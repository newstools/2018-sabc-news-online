The Pan Africanist Congress of Azania  (PAC) is hoping to emerge united from its elective conference that is currently under way in Kimberley in the Northern Cape. Delegates from all nine provinces are attending the three-day conference which started on Friday. Luthando Mbinda and Mzwanele Nyontsho are reported to be vying for the leadership position. At this state, the party cannot confirm the two candidates, saying the names still need to be verified by independent elections agency. The elective conference follows the party’s unity conference in Kimberley four months ago.  Narius Moloto, Letlapa Mphahlele and Luthando Mbinda all claim to be leaders of the party and approached the courts for intervention. “Everybody is here all members throughout the country from all provinces not even a single corner of this country is not covered.  So with that we’ve got our high hopes and we believe that we will emerge much, much stronger,” says PAC’s Spokesperson, Apa Pooe.
