Police Minister Bheki Cele says 15 people have been arrested and about 50 crime-related cases opened following the 2018 Global Citizen Festival at the FNB stadium in Johannesburg, last Sunday. Cele was briefing the media in Parliament on Wednesday following complaints from some concert goers that they were mugged after the event. Cele says a number of police officers, including security personnel from eight private security companies, were deployed to the stadium. Watch related video:
