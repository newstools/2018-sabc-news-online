North West MEC for Public Safety,Dr Mpho Motlhabane, says the number of road fatalities in the province is increasing since the beginning of the festive season. About 61 fatalities have been recorded so far. Dr Motlhabane was speaking at the funeral service of three of the 13 people who were killed in the horrific accident that happened on the R49 road between Mahikeng and Zeerust last Sunday. The funeral service was held at the Lehurutshe Civic Centre in the North West. Thirteen people were killed and 12 others injured following a collision between a 23 seater minibus taxi and a bakkie. Passengers in the minibus taxi were travelling to Itsoseng Township near Lichtenburg to attend a traditional wedding ceremony while the bakkie was travelling to Zeerust. The son of Ntebo Molefe gave an emotional tribute to his late mother and two aunts who all died in an accident. They were on their way to facilitate lobola negotiations a few 100km away from home. Countless families continue to mourn loved ones who perished on the roads. MEC for public safety has appealed to road users to be more cautious. Mpho Motlhabane says: “We are here in Lehurutshe and we have just received news that we have experienced another accident where four  lives have been lost and all four people are from Botswana.” “The driver simply did not stop at the stop sign. This creates a problem for all of us if we don’t observe the rules of the road.” So far over 60 people have died in road carnage in the North West since the beginning of festive season. Traffic officials are out in numbers to curb road fatalities. CLICK VIDEO BELOW:
