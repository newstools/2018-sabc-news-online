Former Eastern Province Rugby Union boss Cheeky Watson and his co-accused have pleaded not guilty to all charges, as the fraud and money laundering trial continues in the Port Elizabeth commercial crimes court. This after a lengthy probe into alleged fraudulent activities involving around R2 million, set for the Nelson Mandela Bay’s Integrated Public Transport System. In a letter read in court on Tuesday, Watson denied any knowledge of any fraudulent activities. In a letter read by Watson’s defence in court, Watson states that he was not aware of any fraudulent activities. He alleges that he had no suspicions when co-accused Nadia Gerwel, former assistant director of accounting in the Nelson Mandela Metro transferred an amount of R2.9 million into the EP rugby account, claiming it would pay a not yet registered vendor. Watson said he trusted Gerwel and had no reason to doubt her. A charge of failure to report fraud has been added to Watson’s charge sheet. He now faces three charges, including money laundering and fraud.
