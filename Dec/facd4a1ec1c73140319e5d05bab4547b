The Nelson Mandela Bay Initiation Forum says, the zero death rate of initiates in the Nelson Mandela Region is a result of following strict procedures. The Forum says all traditional surgeons have to be registered on their database. Regular inspections are done every 24 hours and young men have to go through health inspections before they could go to the bush. More than 20 young men have died in the Eastern Cape in this summer season and traditional leaders in the Eastern Cape predict the number will rise. Traditional surgeon Sebenzile Kopsani started an initiation school four years ago. His passion is to enshrine the tradition and keep the young men safe. So far, 279 young men have performed their traditional custom here at Kampala Farm at Green Bushes near Port Elizabeth. All returned home safely. “If you decide to run off or opt to be an initiation doctor, you need to be dedicated you don’t go for this only for money, you need to dedicate your life 24 hours. I am sleeping here in case there are problems,” says Kopsani. The Forum remains firm that no traditional surgeon will practice any custom without the required certificate. Chairperson of the Forum Chief Velile Mfunda says, “What we have done is to make sure that we are checking each individual, everything must go well. What is important is for them is to drink water; they must drink water all the time.” The Eastern Cape government has called on the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) to intervene and prosecute bogus traditional surgeons. As the season comes to an end the Forum will continue to inspect all circumcision schools this weekend. Watch related video below
