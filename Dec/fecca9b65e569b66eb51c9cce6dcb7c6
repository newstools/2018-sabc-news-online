Transnet says it’s working with law enforcement agencies to ensure that perpetrators are urgently brought to book following an incident in which one of its railway tracks was sliced with a gas-powered cutting torch. The incident happened at eLubana in Nseleni outside Richard’s Bay in northern Kwazulu-Natal Thursday last week. Transnet says there is clear evidence of sabotage. The company and the national economy stand to lose millions of rands from the incident. The act caused a 200 wagon coal train to derail, damaging 51 carriages. The Mpumalanga to Richards Bay freights coal line is one of the key railway networks linking Africa’s coal hub to the rest of the country and the world. All coal exports to China and India have been halted. Railway inspectors believe the line was deliberately vandalised.
