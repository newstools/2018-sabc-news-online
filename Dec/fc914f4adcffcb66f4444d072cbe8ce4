KwaZulu-Natal, among other provinces, is commemorating World AIDS Day. Ulundi in the Zululand district is believed to be among the areas with highest HIV infected youth in the province. The commemoration will include a peace walk led by Transport, Community Safety and Liaison MEC, Mxolisi Kaunda. During the walk, the youth will be educated about the dangers of the virus and the abuse of women and children. Kaunda explains, “We call it a peace walk, the walk entails the fight against women and children abuse. We will start in the gymnasium here in uLundi up to the taxi rank from there we will be circulating pamphlets with information against women abuse as well as HIV and aids as a scourge we must defeat. But we are also happy that in this district the number of people who check their status has increased but we are concerned about the youth who are infected in bigger numbers.” Meanwhile in Johannesburg, Deputy President David Mabuza spoke at the main commemorative function in Dobsonville, Soweto, alongside Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi. The theme for this year’s commemoration is “Know your Status”. It is aimed at encouraging people to get tested for HIV. Watch related video:
