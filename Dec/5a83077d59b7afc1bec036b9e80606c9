Quality assurance body, Umalusi, says it will be approaching education stakeholders to request that matric results be released at a later date than the first week of January. Close to 800 000 matric students sat for the 2018 examinations.  Basic Education Minister, Angie Motshekga is expected to announce the results on the 3rd of January before it is released to students the following day. Umalusi CEO Dr Mafu Ramoketsi briefed the media in Pretoria on their readiness to release the results. “Umalusi would like to take this opportunity to make a fervent appeal to all stakeholders in education including higher education to reconsider the timing of the release of results. It is our considered view that releasing results in the first week of January places tremendous pressure on the entire system including Umalusi’s Quality Assurance processes within very tight deadlines every year. It would therefore benefit the system by releasing results sometime later. This matter will have to be discussed with all the relevant stakeholders.” Meanwhile, Umalusi says it is satisfied with the 2018 matric final exams despite slight irregularities reported in Gauteng and the Eastern Cape.
