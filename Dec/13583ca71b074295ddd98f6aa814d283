Female scientists in sub-Saharan Africa are making quantum waves. Their achievements were crowned at the annual United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) and Lâ€™oreal Women in Science Awards ceremony in Nairobi, Kenya. The awards recognized over 20 Nobel laureates and exceptional women who are advancing faster than the speed of light. In a once male-dominated environment, the young scientists have broken traditional stereotypes and believe empowered women will craft a new landscape in sub-Saharan Africa. The programme ended with an award ceremony, 14 young female researchers were awarded a research grant. The ceremony was attended by a distinguished audience from across the African continent, UNESCO, scientists, academics, intellectuals, thought leaders and organisations promoting gender equality. The 14 fellows, 12 doctoral and two post-doctoral, are drawn from five countries in sub-Saharan Africa. They are Ghana, Mauritius, Kenya, South Africa and Nigeria. They are selected for the scientific excellence of their work by a jury of independent experts. Each year, the program honours five international laureates. It also honours about 300 young women researchers who benefit from a research and training grant.
