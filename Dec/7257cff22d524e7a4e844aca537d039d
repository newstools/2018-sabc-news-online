WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT As South Africa observes 16 Days of Activism against women and children abuse, SABC News brings you another disturbing story of child abuse. A 44-year-old man has allegedly raped and  infected his seven year old niece with HIV. It’s alleged he also raped the victims’ six-year-old cousin. But the six-year-old cousin hasn’t been infected. The man has since been arrested and will appear in court for a formal bail hearing in court on Wednesday. Too young to understand sexual abuse the seven-year-old girl accidentally reached out to her aunt. She wanted to know if her aunt ever experienced what she had experienced; a question that blew the lid. “I asked her how did the uncle raped her she told me … then I went to tell her mom. I asked her why she did not tell us before she said uncle said he would beat her up and kill her if she told anyone,” says the aunt. A doctor has allegedly confirmed the rapes. The six-year-old and seven-year-old girls were sleeping on their grandmother’s bed when the uncle allegedly took them and placed them on this bed and allegedly raped them. The family says a doctor who examined both girls says the damage was so severe showing that the rapes happened repeatedly. The two children are yet to receive counselling. The seven-year-old victim has been asking her mother a lot of questions, trying to make sense of what had happened. “She is not okay even at school she is different now and she keeps asking me why does she have to take pills every day is she going to have to take them for the rest of her life then we try to make her forget about it saying no she won’t,” says the victim’s mother.
