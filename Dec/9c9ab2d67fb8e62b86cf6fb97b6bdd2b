Three people who were left unconscious have been taken to hospital and 10 others slightly injured when congregants rushed into the Enlightened Christian Gathering Church of Prophet Shepard Bushiri in Pretoria on Friday. The legal representative of the church, Terence Baloyi says an unexpected thunderstorm caught church congregants off guard and they had to seek shelter inside the church at the Tshwane Events Centre. Baloyi says people started to panic which led to injuries. ”Unfortunately as people were walking into the church the rain started. It was heavy and people ran for shelter into the church premises as they were running to the church somehow pushed each other and others fell down and got injured. We learn that three of them are hospitalised and we’re still following up to check their condition. We also learnt that there were around five to ten people or so who were injured and taken to hospital right now.”
