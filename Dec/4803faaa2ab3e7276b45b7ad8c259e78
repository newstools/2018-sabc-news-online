The African National Congress’s (ANC) National Working Committee (NWC) has decided that former Gauteng Health MEC Qedani Mahlangu should step down as the party’s Gauteng Executive Committee Member. In October the ANC’s Gauteng Integrity Committee recommended that Mahlangu, Brian Hlongwa and former Emfuleni mayor Simon Mofokeng should not hold any public office positions. The ANC Provincial Executive Committee (PEC) which is expected to meet on Tuesday says it is not aware of such a decision. In a letter seen by SABC NEWS the ANC NWC requests that Mahlangu step down from the ANC’s Gauteng PEC with immediate effect. However, this decision does not affect Mahlangu’s membership of the ANC. It’s not clear at the moment what the NWC’s stance is on Hlongwa and Simon Mofokeng. The ANC’s Gauteng Integrity Committee had also recommended that the three be removed from the ANC and its structures. However, the PEC disagreed saying this was the view of the ANC’s constitutional disciplinary committee and not the integrity committee. Mahlangu resigned as Gauteng Health MEC in the wake of the Esidimeni tragedy. Hlongwa stepped down as ANC Chief Whip in the Gauteng Legislature. Mofokeng also resigned at both mayor and councillor of the embattled Emfuleni municipality in the Vaal.
