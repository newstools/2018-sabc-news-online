WARNING: CONTAINS GRAPHIC DETAILS A mother and her boyfriend accused of Baby Daniel‘s murder in 2016 will know their fate on Tuesday. The pair is on trial in the South Gauteng High Court for the murder, abuse and neglect of the three-year-old. Daniel died after allegedly being beaten and put in a bath of boiling hot water. The baby’s name has been changed to protect his identity. “He was a sweet boy, happy, graceful, not timid or scared. We didn’t know what was going on,” says a family member, Jenette de Klerk. But his life was cut brutally short and he died a heinous death allegedly at the hands of his caregivers. “We can’t sugar coat it he was murdered brutally. He was tortured to death,” says Luke Lamprecht of Women and Men Against Child Abuse. The child was killed two years ago after sustaining a broken elbow, femur, and burn wounds. The post mortem also disclosed multiple blunt force trauma to the head. For the family, Baby Daniel’s murder has left deep scars. “For Daniel’s siblings life will never be the same. They know their brother’s dead. They are all scattered and they will never grow up together,” adds De Klerk. Close to 1000 children are murdered yearly in the country at the hands of their caregivers. Watch video below:
