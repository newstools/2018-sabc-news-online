The African National Congress (ANC) Women League says it will support the victim of the sexual assault allegedly perpetrated by the ANC national spokesperson Pule Mabe. Mabe has since taken a leave of absence following the allegations against him. The ANC has confirmed that it has received a letter of complaint from Mabe’s personal assistant last week. In the letter the complainant details two alleged incidents of sexual assault which occurred this year at St George’s Hotel in Pretoria and in Limpopo. The matter has not yet been reported to the police. The league’s president Bathabile Dlamini says this is a serious societal problem. “As the women’s league when there is a case of abuse, sexual harassment even rape we support the victim then secondly we always wait for the disciplinary processes to go through and then thereafter we pronounce ourselves differently on the matter. The minute I had about this issue yesterday I talked to Pule he says he is prepared to go to the committee that has been set up to look into the grievance,” says  Dlamini.
