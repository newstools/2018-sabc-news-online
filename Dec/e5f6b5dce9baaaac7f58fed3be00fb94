President Cyril Ramaphosa has vowed to expedite the processing of the remaining six of the eight bills that came before him in 2018. He only signed two bills into law during the year. These were the Public Audit Amendment Bill, which gives the Auditor General more powers to act against officials who misspend taxpayersâ€™ money, and the National Minimum Wage Bill, which allows low paid workers to earn not less than R20 per hour. Other Bills that are still to be signed into law include the Extension of Security of Tenure Amendment Bill and the Labour Relations Amendment Bill. Lobby groups like Right2Know and My Vote Counts want the president to assent to the Political Party Funding Bill to ensure transparency about private donations to political parties before the May elections.
