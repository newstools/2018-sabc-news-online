The Road Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC) says it’s worrying that there have already been so many fatal crashes since the start of the holiday period with the long weekend just past. About 40 deaths have been reported in the Western Cape, 28 in the Eastern Cape, about 20 in KwaZulu-Natal. RTMC spokesperson Simon Zwane has called on road users to exercise extreme caution ahead of Christmas as holidaymakers travel to various holiday destinations. “It’s been a very challenging weekend – and the stats are not looking good at all. We’ve had five major accidents that we are investigating… that is only from Saturday to yesterday (Monday) – it’s about 36-fatalities. There have been too many people dying in single accidents. There were 12 in the Western Cape, five in North West, five in Kranskop and there was a police officer killed because a drunk driver failed to stop at the road block. So, it has not been an easy weekend at all,” says Zwane. Watch related video below:
