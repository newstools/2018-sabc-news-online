The African National Congress (ANC) says it’s all systems go for the upcoming BRICS political parties dialogue on Tuesday. Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa are the countries that will be discussing economic and political challenges. The dialogue is also expected to reach an agreement on how to further enhance relations among the countries. The three day gathering of the BRICS countries is taking place at a time when the participation of Brazil hangs in the balance. But, the ANC is confident that things will go according to plan. Lindiwe Zulu chair: ANC sub-committee on International Relations says: “It is envisaged that the BRICS political parties dialogue will reach an agreement which will be encapsulated in the Johannesburg declaration – you will recall that the previous meeting of political parties  and NGOs – they came out with the Johannesburg declaration.” The political parties dialogue takes place under the theme “towards building a common agenda, inclusive development and multilateralism in the 4th industrial revolution.” President Cyril Ramaphosa as the current chair of BRICS will deliver an opening address – laying a ground for robust discussions on how to further develop these five countries.
