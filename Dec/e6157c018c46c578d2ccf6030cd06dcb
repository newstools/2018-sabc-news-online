A group of 60 customers is taking First National Bank (FNB) to court over a theft that happened two years ago. The group, which was part of the 300 people that lost their valuables kept in bank safes, refused to settle with the bank and has now decided to sue it in the Johannesburg High Court. FNB says it has instructed its attorneys to defend the matter and highlighted that it settled the matter in 2017 with the majority of complainants. The group’s spokesperson, Kelly Fraser, says they want R121 million adding that they have proof that FNB was negligent. “During our investigation as a group, we found that there was evidence that there was co-operation between employees of FNB and robbers. For example, there is video evidence in Parktown that shows an employee supposedly locking the vault but leaving it open at Sunnypark. We found that there was a security official that deactivated the alarm so it’s a long list,” says Fraser.
