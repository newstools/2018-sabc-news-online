The DA, COPE and ACDP in the Nelson Mandela metro are expected to table a motion of no confidence in Executive Mayor Mongameli Bobani in Port Elizabeth on Tuesday. This is the second such motion since the new coalition government, made up of the ANC, the AIC , United Front, UDM, which is Bobani’s party, took over from a DA-led coalition in August. The DA was ousted from power through a motion of no confidence in its then mayor of the metro, Athol Trollip. DA Provincial Leader Nqaba Bhanga says Bobani is facing serious allegations of corruption. “Mayor Bobani has been recently implicated in serious allegations of corruption regarding the IPTS programme of the municipality. He’s also a subject of the forensic investigation by the Hawks in terms of the alleged corrupt relationship with a local businessman. Councilor Bobani is also implicated in at least two instances of unlawful interference in the administration of the municipality.” Mayor Bobani has denied all these allegations.
