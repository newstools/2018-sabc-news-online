We need to change mind-sets and remove the stigma attached to men and women living with Albinism. The Khulisa social solutions organisation – as part of its 16 Days of Activism campaign – highlighted the emotional, spiritual and human rights violations of a vulnerable group in society. It’s still a struggle, people still see those living with Albinism as “other”. Simply because they are different, bullying is a part of their daily experience. “People really underestimate the power bullying has in our schools. The kids who do the bulling, its a reflection of who they are and how they see themselves and I was fortunate enough to overcome that because of the support that I had in my family despite the fact that I was bullied a lot, because other kids would not want to play with me because I am different,” says activist, Ingrid Bame. Albinism is a genetic disorder. People are born with no pigment in their skin, eyes and hair. Simba Gozo is a male model, business person and motivational speaker. He says his condition does not define him. “So for example if I were to meet people or clients or go out somewhere and they don’t know what I look like they are like, oh is this you, but because of my confidence and outgoing personality I overpower their reaction with that, put it aside an assure the person that I am human, I can do the job. I just have a different colour skin.” Regina Ndlovu says she was abused and raped from a young age and had no-one to turn to. “Parents need to always take caution of their kids because I had a teacher who used my eyesight issue to claim that he was helping me to learn but at the same time he had his hands up my dress so at that time I didn’t know it was a form of abuse.” The 16 days of activism for no violence against women and children ends on the 10th of December. But activists plan to ramp up their efforts to highlight the abuse and stigma of people living with Albinism. WATCH VIDEO BELOW:
