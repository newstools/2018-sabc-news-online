The Limpopo provincial government is commemorating World AIDS Day with activities at Mankweng, outside Polokwane. Health MEC Phophi Ramathuba has addressed scores of community members on government’s continued efforts to reduce the prevalence of HIV/AIDS. Districts in the province such as Waterberg and Mopani are amongst the highest in the province. Ramathuba says cases of new infections at districts such as Vhembe are going down. “ Waterberg is still leading us in terms of HIV and AIDS. We are still high,  we are still very worried, but of course  we are now coming down to 37% (infected people). But we are still high,  it is one of those districts we are worried about and of course the Vhembe District is still maintaining the fact that the rates are low, so what we are saying, if we can continue to strengthen the programs we have put in place especially on the new infections we can be able to win that.”
