The African National Congress (ANC) in Gauteng says its  party list process in the province has been successful and smooth.  The conference took place in Centurion on Wednesday where 334 branches met. This party list process aims to come up with names nominated by the party to serve the country at both provincial and national level after the 2019 elections. Gauteng ANC chairperson David Makhura says the preliminary list is an inclusive one. “That list represents the best in the ANC in the province; the best amongst us who must go serve our people in national Parliament as well as in the Gauteng legislature. So that was tested. So we are  basically saying if you want to get things right with our conferences the lesson is always simple, your branch process must be clean. It must be transparent, it must follow the procedure guidelines and nobody must be excluded,” says Makhura. Meanwhile, Gauteng ANC provincial secretary Jacob Khawe has resigned as Emfuleni executive mayor. Khawe confirmed his resignation during a press briefing in Johannesburg on Thursday. Khawe has been at loggerheads with the embattled ANC Sedibeng regional executive committee after allegations of corruption at the municipality. Khawe says a new mayor is expected to be announced on Friday.
