A Democratic Alliance (DA) councillor, Charles Crawford, says he and his family are living in fear following a shooting incident at his home in Reiger Park in Ekurhuleni. Crawford’s house was attacked by unknown people in the early hours of Sunday morning. Crawford says despite the attack on his family, he won’t stop serving the community. “ We feel depressed after an incident like this happened. I could have been killed; my wife could have been killed. My son, my grand-children could have been killed. The gun shot is there on the wall. One bullet went through my window and my grand-son was, we have a double story, on his way down. The very same area where he had to come down, at the stair-case, that’s where the bullet hit.” The DA earlier said  it is concerned about the safety of its councillor Crawford. The DA’s Belinda Bozzoli says six shots were fired: “This is all about elections we think. We don’t know who exactly did this shooting. But the councillor in Reiger Park has been under a lot pressure from various factions over the last couple of months. So it’s a very sad thing. I think what they are doing is the faction that is being violent is trying to drive the councillor out.” Gauteng police are investigating the shooting.
