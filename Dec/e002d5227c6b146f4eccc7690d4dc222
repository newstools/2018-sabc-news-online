Airline CemAir has until lunchtime on Thursday to comply with aviation regulations, failing which its flying licence will be revoked and it will not be allowed to operate. On Wednesday the South African Civil Aviation Authority grounded CemAir from flying. The CAA says the airline is severely non-compliant with regulations and that poses a serious safety risk to the public. It says CemAir has failed to produce proof of the appointment of an approved and qualified person for a critical position as required by the Civil Aviation Regulations. South African Civil Aviation Authority Pappie Maja says: “They don’t have anybody who is assigned to ensure that the operations of the airline are safe. This implies that Cemair cannot operate as an approved air operator and its unfortunate that the action taken by CAA will affect their clients negatively but this was done in the best interest of aviation safety.” “The operator is expected to address findings that were communicated to them and they will have to submit corrective action plans to CAA which will then be reviewed. If found acceptable, CAA will revoke the prohibition order which is valid for a period of 24 hours,” says Maja.
