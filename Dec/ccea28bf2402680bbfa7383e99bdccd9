International Monetary Fund (IMF) Managing Director Christine Lagarde  says she has not received any request from South Africa for a financial aid programme. South Africa struggles with weak economic growth and rising debt. “I am not here to discuss any kind of financial support or to negotiate any kind of programme and I have not received any request to that effect,” Lagarde told reporters in Pretoria. “That is crystal clear and I hope it puts to bed some of the rumours or noises here and there about this particular matter.” Meeting with the Reserve Bank Governor Lesetja Kganyago earlier, Lagarde says fighting corruption can improve the status of South Africa’s economy. She commended the State Capture commission as the best decision for the people of South Africa.  In November, the IMF praised South Africa for its economic reforms. The financial institution said strengthening the finances of state-owned entities and reducing the cost of doing business were key to the economic stability of South Africa.
