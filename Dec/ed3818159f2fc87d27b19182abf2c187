Sun City’s management in the North West says all the events planned for the festive period in the resort, will go ahead as scheduled. This is after a severe hailstorm hit the hotel on Saturday.  About 400 rooms were reported damaged, and the management says it will take a few weeks to fix the remaining 100 rooms. General Manager of the Resort Raul De Lima, says things are back to normal at the resort. “By far and large all our festivities for December carry on. We’re glad to say that our Christmas carols by candlelight on Christmas Eve will take place. Our big Christmas lunch that’s planned for Christmas day is intact. Our New Year celebrations are all intact and by and large we are ready to receive guests,” says de Lima. Watch related videos:
