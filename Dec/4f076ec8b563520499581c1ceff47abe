The Gauteng Liquor Board says it supports the call by the Road Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC) for a proposed amendment of the law, to keep drunk drivers behind bars for a week before they appear in court. Currently they can be kept for up to 24 hours before getting bail. CEO of the Gauteng Liquor Board, Raymond Martin says the amendment to the Road Traffic Act should not be delayed, because drivers are failing to take responsibility on the road. Martin has been speaking at the launch of an awareness campaign against drinking and driving in Bryanston, north of Johannesburg. “So 2016 to 2017 just in Gauteng, the stats on the amount of people arrested for drinking and driving stands as such there was about 27 834 arrests made for drinking and driving. The 17/18 year went even far more than it was so the stats increased now to 33173 surely something needs to give.”
