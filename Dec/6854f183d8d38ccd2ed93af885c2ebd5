Mine workers affiliated to National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) have downed tools at the Mafube coal mine in Wonderfontein, Mpumalanga. The workers are demanding a 10% salary increase and the employer is offering only 7% and 7.5%. The strike is in its second week affecting coal production. Over 150 mine workers on strike. They have been on strike since Wednesday. NUM Regional Chairperson Nelson Ratshoshi says:” We have come down to 8% but they are offering 7% and 7.5% and a settlement offer of R2500 once off and is tax free. On the issue of commuter allowance there is a stalemate.” Meanwhile, the mine has been operating with skeletal staff since Friday. NUM local secretary Johannes Nkhoma says they will continue with the strike until management gives in to their demands. “We have decided to embark on strike as community because the employer is not ready to listen to the worker’s because basically our initial demand was that the employer should offer us 10% of the basic salary and 7% of all other allowances but the employer decided to offer 5% on the allowances.”
