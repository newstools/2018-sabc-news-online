A young environmental activist, Greta Thunberg, has made waves at the recent COP24 climate change conference in Poland. The teenager is known for weekly demonstrations in her home country Sweden. Thunberg wants governments to account. “We have not come here to beg world leaders to care, you have ignored us in the past and you will ignore us again. You have ran out of excuses and we are running out of time. We have come here to let you know that change is coming whether you like it or not.” She says until governments keep fossil fuels in the ground, no one is safe. “You only speak of green eternal economic growth because you are too scared of being unpopular. You only talk about moving forward with the same bad ideas that got us into this mess, even if the only sensible thing to do is pull the emergency brake.” Thunberg says one is never too young to make a difference. She eats, sleeps and dreams activism. WATCH BELOW:
