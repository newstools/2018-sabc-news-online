The North West department of Health says most young people between the ages of 15 and 24 are not aware of their HIV status. The Department is therefore encouraging this age group to do HIV tests. The South African Research Council report says about seven million people are living with HIV across the country. About 60% of them are receiving antiretroviral. The commemoration held in Rustenburg was aimed at educating people about the scourge of HIV in society. The United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS, UNAIDS statistics of 2017 shows that this country has the largest HIV epidemic in the world with 19%. However, in the North West about 22.7% of people are HIV positive – with most infected staying in the mining communities. Thuthula Balfour, head of Mineral Council of South Africa, says most of the people in the mines default on their medication. “The aim is to make sure that everyone is screened so that you should know that you have TB or HIV. Also to make sure that anyone who is HIV positive or has TB gets on to treatment and then you finish your treatment if you are on medication – or make sure that you stay on your treatment. So if you do all of that really, most people will have good life expectancy.” Newly appointed MEC for Health, Madoda Sambatha, says the high rate of HIV in mining communities is due to the stigma among mineworkers. North West Premier Job Mokgoro says young people are reluctant to get tested. He encouraged people to use Impilo programme to know their status.
