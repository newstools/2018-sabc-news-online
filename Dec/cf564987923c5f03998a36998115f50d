The Africa National Congress and the South Africa Communist Party have joined other South Africans in paying tribute to the country’s former High Commissioner to the United Kingdom and ANC stalwart, Mendi Msimang, who passed away on Monday morning at the age of 90. Msimang served as the top diplomat in London in the 1990’s and was then ANC Treasurer General up to 2007. SA Communist Party (SACP) Spokesperson Alex Mashilo says Msimang served the ANC and the country with distinction. He was the governing party’s Treasurer General up to the Polokwane conference in 2007, was married to former Minister of Health, Manto Tshabalala-Msimang, until her death in 2009. The couple were married in 1961. Mendi Msimang had been a member of the ANC Youth League and served for a time as secretary to party icon Walter Sisulu.
