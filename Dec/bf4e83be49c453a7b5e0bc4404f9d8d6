Relatives of some of the people missing on the Malaysian Airlines flight, MH370, have urged Malaysia to resume a search for the plane that disappeared in 2014. This after they handed over what they believe is five new pieces of debris from it. Flight MH370 was on its way from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing, with 239 people on board, when it vanished – and became one of the world’s greatest aviation mysteries. Investigators believe the jet veered off course before plunging into the Indian Ocean. The next of kin of some of those on board have handed the government five pieces of debris – that they said was found by villagers in Madagascar. More than 30 bits of suspected debris have been collected from places around the world – but only three wing fragments have been confirmed to be from MH370. The four-year long search formerly ended in May.
