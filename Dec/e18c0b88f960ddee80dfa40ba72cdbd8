Both the City of Cape Town and the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) are expected to take action against the private company at the heart of the Clifton beach saga, Professional Protection Alternatives (PPA). The EFF says it will lay charges against PPA over the incident a week ago when PPA personnel told a group of picnickers to leave the beach, telling them it closes at eight in the evening. EFF supporters held a protest on the beach yesterday evening, in the latest of several such actions. The City of Cape Town said earlier the security company had no mandate to tell beachgoers to leave. It’s expected to report PPA to the Private Security Industry Regulatory Body, Public Relations Institute of Southern Africa (PRISA) on Monday. City Mayor, Dan Plato, says he’s planning to meet with all parties implicated in the Clifton Beach saga: “I will talk to the people involved; I will get to the bottom of it myself. But my own investigation shown there was no need for that. They stage these issues and make a political point out of it and what they don’t realise is that they are doing nothing other than polarising the Western Cape themselves,” adds Plato.
