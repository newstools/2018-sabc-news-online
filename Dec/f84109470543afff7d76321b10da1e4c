At least 900 suspects are on Tuesday expected to appear in different courts in Gauteng. They were arrested at road blocks during the long weekend for various crimes including murder, rape, possession of drugs as well as drunk driving. Police also recovered 24 unlicensed firearms and seized counterfeit goods worth more than R8 million. Ten non-compliant liquor outlets were closed down. Gauteng Police Spokesperson Kay Makhubele says: “Police have been out in full force on the streets conducting the Safer Festive Season Operations.” “We managed to conduct roadblocks around areas we believe are hotspots. We also had roadblocks in borders going in and out of Gauteng. That operation will continue throughout the festive season.”
