Western Cape traffic police say a driver doing well over 200 kilometres per hour was among those arrested on the N-1 between Beaufort West and Laingsburg since the start of the week. A total of ten motorists have been arrested separately for speeding. Provincial traffic chief Kenny Africa says they also included a minibus taxi driver, who was arrested for drunken driving as well as speeding in Beaufort West: Africa adds, “In Beaufort-West a taxi driver was arrested for doing 129 km/h in a 100 zone. Then in Laingsburg a driver of a BMW did 214 km/h in a 120 zone. We are urging motorists, do not do excessively high speeds on our roads. Remember, speed kills. If you do excessively high speeds on our roads we will arrest you.”
