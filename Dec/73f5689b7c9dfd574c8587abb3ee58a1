The ANC study group in the Joint Constitutional Review Committee has rejected the Freedom Front Plus Chief Whip Corne Mulder’s view that the committee process of land reform was a disgrace. Mulder claims that the process was flawed and manipulated.  The committee ultimately recommended in its report that Section 25 of the constitution be amended to allow for the expropriation of land without compensation. The NCOP and the National Assembly approved the committee’s report and recommendations earlier this month. ANC Member of the Committee Vincent Smith, who co-chaired it during provincial public hearings, says Mulder’s insinuations do not come as a surprise. “As the ANC we disagree fundamentally with the Freedom Front Plus that this was a sham or that this was a disgrace. Of course the Freedom Front Plus will argue that way because from the word go, they were opposed to expropriation of land without compensation. So, anything to discredit the committee they will go ahead and do it, but as far as we are concerned the process was fair, the process was transparent and the process will pass constitutional muster.”
