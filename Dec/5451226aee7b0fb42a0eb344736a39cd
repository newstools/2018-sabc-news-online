The former Mayor of the Makhado Local Municipality, Mavhungu Luruli Ramakhanya, has been elected as the new Executive Mayor of Vhembe District Municipality in Limpopo. She was sworn in by Judge Nare Frans Kgomo in the municipal chambers during a special council sitting in Thohoyandou on Friday. Luruli Ramakhanya has replaced Florence Radzilani who resigned on Tuesday after being implicated in the looting of VBS Mutual Bank. Ramakhanya was a Proportional Representative Councillor of Vhembe when she was elected Executive Mayor. She was recalled as the Mayor of Makhado more than five years ago during the administration of the former premier Cassel Mathale. Ramakhanya has hit the ground running by immediately appointing members of her mayoral committee. She has pledged to improve the delivery of basic services. “I believe that they have delegated me to lead in a collective and I want to say to all the residents of Vhembe we know that there are different community structures, different forums, different committees that have got interest in making sure that this municipality is supported. We make sure that we take service to the people and I’m saying to all the structures and all the people, let’s continue to work together to build the better Vhembe, let’s continue to work together to service the people,” says Ramakhanya.
