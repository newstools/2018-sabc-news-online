Lobby group Afriforum has confirmed that a warrant of arrest has been issued for former Zimbabwean first lady Grace Mugabe for her alleged assault of South African model Gabriella Engels. In July, AfriForum won a High Court application to review and set aside the government’s decision to grant Mugabe diplomatic immunity. Mugabe allegedly assaulted Engels at a hotel in Johannesburg in August last year. The former Zimbabwean first lady claimed that she was acting in self-defence. AfriForum CEO Kallie Kriel says they are determined to ensure that no one is above the law. “She can be extradited to South Africa if need be, but let’s I think it would be in her own interest to get this case behind her and take the opportunity in court to state the case. So, there is now a warrant of arrest but of course, if she decides not to come to the country then I’m sure there are processes that will be followed to get her here.” Click on video below:
