The ANC in Gauteng says it has applied for a Special Provincial Funeral to be accorded to late senior official Khabisi Mosunkutu. Mosunkutu passed away on Christmas Eve at the age of 69. Earlier on Wednesday, top ANC officials led by Treasurer General, Paul Mashatile visited the Mosunkuthu home in Kibler Park, south of Johannesburg to offer their condolences. The party’s spokesperson in the province Tasneem Motara says they hope to get approval from the Presidency by Friday. “The ANC in Gauteng has, through the office of the Premier, applied for a Special Provincial Funeral for the late Khabisi Mosunkutu, who was a member of the provincial legislature. So, the province has applied for a Special Provincial Funeral, which we hope will be approved before the end of the week. The Premier’s office is the one that facilitates on behalf of the provincial government which then goes to the Presidency for final approval.” African National Congress (ANC) Treasurer General Paul Mashatile says the ANC must take lessons from the life of Mosunkuthu regarding good leadership. He says Mosunkutus are a beacon of light for the party. “… leading with integrity, being committed without looking for rewards, selfless comrade. So that kind of character; those kind of values of selflessness; of service to the people; commitment; being reliable – that’s all the things we need to learn from Comrade Khabs and use them to propel us forward as we continue to serve the people of this country,” says Mashatile.
