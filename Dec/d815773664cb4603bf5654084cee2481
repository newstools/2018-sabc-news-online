Workers at Autopax which operates City to City and Translux buses are on strike. They say the company has introduced some changes to how it pays workers for working on a Sunday. The workers say they were shocked to find that deductions were made from their salaries this month. This comes at the time when many people are leaving for their holiday destinations ahead of the Christmas day celebrations. If no solution is found, passengers could be left stranded. South African Transport and Allied Workers Union’s (Satawu), Zanele Sabela says their members are very upset. “They did give management a warning on Wednesday to say, if this is not rectified immediately they will go on strike on Thursday. They will not be taking buses out. So management apologised and said they will only be paying them on January 11. This was not acceptable to the workers who decided not to go to work today.”
