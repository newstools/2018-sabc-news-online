Democratic Alliance (DA) leader Mmusi Maimane has conceded that his party did not perform well this year and had a lot of challenges including the removal of Athol Trollip booted as Nelson Mandela Bay Metro Mayor. He was addressing party members in Johannesburg, where he was giving his assessment of the party for the year 2018. Maimane, however, says he does not regret his action against former Cape Town Mayor Patricia De Lille. De Lille left the party following a prolonged battle and formed a new political party last month. Maimane says action needed to be taken as there is no one above the party. “We knew for a long time that something was happening there and we needed to act – we are the only political party that says it doesn’t matter how good you are in public – however if we suspect that you need to account, we will act. And I know it is difficult and sometimes people don’t understand because there were other Councillors in Cape Town who came out saying they are being prosecuted because of the colour of our skins.” Maimane says for as long he is still the leader of the DA, he will foster diversity within the party and make sure South Africa realises the dream of a rainbow nation, born in 1994. “For as long as I am leader of the DA we will continue to fight to make sure that Black people,  Coloured people, Indian people, white people – “noise” working together. It’s what we are about, we must never deter away from that and I want to tell you, this thing is so confusing for people because there are very few parties that are doing it.”
