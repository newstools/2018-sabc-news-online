Tiger Brands says it’s assisting the legal team for listeriosis victims to locate all those affected by the disease. On Monday, the South Gauteng High Court in Johannesburg awarded the victims a class action certificate to file a lawsuit against Tiger Brands. More than 1 000 people contracted listeriosis and 218 died during the outbreak from 2016 to this year. This has been recorded as the world’s worst outbreak. The disease was traced to Tiger Brands’ Enterprise meat processing factory in Polokwane. The food company’s Chief Corporate Affairs Officer, Mary-Jane Morifi, says they have contributed R1 million towards initiatives to locate all the victims and their families. She says: “The support that we will provide is the co-funding of the communication campaign that they will initiate to try and find those individuals who believe that they have a legitimate claim. Part of the communication campaign will also include having some information on our website and on our social media.” “We will work together to get the legal process started. Should liability be established, the company will entertain any legitimate claims that come through,” adds Morifi. Watch full interview below
