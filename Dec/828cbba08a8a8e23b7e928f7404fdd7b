A number of 26 elephants have died in Kenya’s Masaai Mara game reserves in the last three months according to a report published by elephant conservation group, the Mara Elephant Project. The report terms as “worrying” the rise of what it terms unknown deaths. Out of the 26 deaths, at least 11 of them are believed to have been poisoned. These deaths according to the report account for 42% of the total elephant deaths in Kenya in 2018. They say there has been a rise in unknown causes of elephant deaths, but believe at least 11 were poisoned with the aim of poaching or due to human wildlife conflict if they invaded neighbouring farms.
