Zimbabwe’s ruling Zimbabwe African National Union –Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF) party has given President Emmerson Mnangagwa the go ahead to run for a second five year term in 2023. This ends speculation that 76 year old Mnangagwa would step down to pave the way for one of his deputies at the next election. Mnangagwa came to power in November 2017 after veteran leader Robert Mugabe was forced to resign following an army coup. Mnangagwa was then elected in a July presidential vote that his main opponent the Movement of Democratic Change (MDC) Nelson Chamisa says he won fraudulently.
