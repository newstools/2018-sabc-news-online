Among the inspiring stories aired on SABC news this year, is the trials and tribulations of a University of Johannesburg mechanical engineering student. Sam Mangena failed in 2014 and lost his bursary and university residence but was determined to qualify. He roamed the streets collecting recyclables, built a shack for shelter and studied by candle light. But his burden was much lighter when donors opened their hearts and pockets. He got accommodation and a bursary after his story was aired, leaving a life of hardship behind. Ten months later and true to his word Mangena completed his B-Tech. He has moved back to his shack and is fixing cars. “I buy food for myself this side and also send some money back home so that my mom so she can have a living and my other siblings,” says Mangena.
