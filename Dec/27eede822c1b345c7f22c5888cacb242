Mongezi Mncunukelwa, who escaped from the high court in Johannesburg this month is back behind bars, this time for life. Police say Mncunukelwa was convicted of two counts of murder at the South Gauteng High Court on Friday. He killed two men in Katlehong, west of Johannesburg early last year. On December 5, he escaped from the same court forcing police to initiate a manhunt for his re-arrest. He is still due to make more appearances in court for rape and escaping from lawful custody. SAPS Spokesperson Mavela Masondo says: “The management of the South African Police Service in Gauteng has welcomed the two life sentences that were handed down. Mncunukelwa escaped and he was re-arrested by the police two weeks later. The Gauteng Police Management applauded the team of detectives that worked tirelessly and with enthusiasm to ensure that the accused is brought to book.”
