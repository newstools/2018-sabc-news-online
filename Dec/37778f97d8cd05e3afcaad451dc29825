From politics to economics, sports to lifestyle, 2018 hardly gave anyone a moment to catch their breath as it sped from one jaw-dropping moment to the next.

Newsmakers and regular members of the public said things that were hilarious, infuriating, and heartbreaking. More than a few times, they left us shaking our heads in confused disbelief.
