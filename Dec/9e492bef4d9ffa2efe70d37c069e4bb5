The National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) says during the evaluation process it has discovered a total of over 56 000 applications with missing supporting documents. All applicants with missing supporting documents have until this Friday to upload and submit these documents online or via email. From December the 15th, 2018 applications with missing documents will be rejected. NSFAS spokesperson Kagisho Mamabolo has advised applicants to log onto their websites to check if they’ve submitted all the required documents. “The documents that are missing are copies of Id’s of applicants, copy of Id’s of parents or guardians, consent forms which we normally use to verify the income that has been declared and also copies of salary advice from parents or any form of income that is available from the applicants.”
