The African National Congress in Gauteng says the late former senior party official will be remembered as a trade-unionist who played a key role in ensuring that workers were not only united but were at the fore-front of dislodging the repressive apartheid regime. Mosunkuthu passed away on Christmas Eve at the age of 69. He had not been well after he suffered a stroke. Mosunkutu resigned from the provincial legislature in 2011 after more than a decade as a member of the executive in various portfolios. Watch related videos:
