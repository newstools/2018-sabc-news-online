SABC Education in partnership with the Department of Basic Education (DBE) is launching its matric results services which will run from 10 December 2018 until 31 January 2019. The Minister of Basic Education, Angie Motshekga, will announce the release of the National Senior Certificate results on 3 January 2019. The SABC Education Matric Results service will release the results to all students across all provinces who registered on its database using SMS, USSD or the new matric results service, MatricsMate App on 4 January 2019. It is paramount for learners to register on MatricsMate for them to access their results via this App. Learners should register their 13-digit ID number and exam number on the platform of their choice to accessÂ their results. In 2017, more than 300 000 students received results via the SABC Education SMS and USSD services. : DV.load("https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5497974-MEDIA-STATEMENT-10-12-18.js", {
