The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) has decided to institute criminal proceedings against former African National Congress (ANC) Western Cape leader, Marius Fransman for alleged sexual assault. NPA spokesperson Phaadi Shuping says this was communicated to Fransman’s legal representatives on Friday. The charges relates to sexual assault allegations made by his former personal assistant, Louisa Wynand. The alleged assault happened in a Kimberley hotel in 2016, while Fransman and his entourage were en route to the ANC’s January 8 celebrations in the North West. Wynand revealed her name to media in 2016. The NPA dropped the charges in May 2016, citing lack of evidence. Wynand’s legal representative, Gavin Prince says that his client is relieved at the NPA’s decision. Listen to Gavin Prince below: <a href="https://iono.fm/e/634687">Content hosted by iono.fm</a>
