An elderly woman has been burnt to death at Brooksneck village near EmaXesibeni, formerly known as Mt Ayliff, in the Eastern Cape. It’s alleged that the 75-year-old woman was accused of practicing witchcraft. This is the second incident at EmaXesibeni in two weeks, following an incident in which two sisters were burnt to death at Ngonyameni village. Police Spokesperson, Khaya Tonjeni says an inquest docket has been opened. “As the Eastern Cape SAPS, we are shocked, ashamed and disappointed at the continuation of such callous attacks against our elderly. We had a similar incident in the last week and when we heard of such, we escalated it immediately to the provincial level; assembled a team of detectives and arrested. But the continuation of such attacks means that now we need to change the strategy. There’s some different and pro-active strategy we need to implore to ensure that we don’t only treat the symptoms, but we address the root cause of such problems within our communities,” says Tonjeni.
