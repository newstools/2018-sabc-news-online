The Democratic Alliance (DA) has called on Treasury Director-General Dondo Mogajane to immediately resign. In a report which Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane released on Wednesday, she found that Mogajane had failed to disclose that he had been convicted of contravening the Road Traffic Infringement Act in 2011. Mkhwebane had received a complaint that was lodged anonymously in August last year. She says Mogajane failed to act with integrity and honesty towards his employer. The DA’s Alf Lees says Mogajane should not continue in his position because he’s dishonest. “The job he is doing requires the utmost honesty. His duty to National Treasury handles all the finances of the country. So the failure to disclose is an act of dishonesty, which should not be part of a person holding such a high profile or anywhere. And disappointing as it is, he needs to do the right thing and resign,” says Lees. Click on video below:
