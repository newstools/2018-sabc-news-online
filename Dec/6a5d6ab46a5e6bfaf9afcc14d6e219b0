Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi has expressed concern that the moves in Parliament toward land expropriation without compensation will open old wounds and work against social cohesion in South Africa. Buthelezi, also the traditional prime minister of the Amazulu, was speaking at an event at the Indian Consulate in Durban about the impact Indians have had on culture in South Africa. He argued that the African National Congress (ANC)-led government is seeking to forcibly resettle people in much the same way the apartheid government did. Buthelezi says he supports land redress, but within the confines of the current clauses of the Constitution. “If I put myself in the feet of an investor in Europe or America, and I’m asked to go to a country where there’s expropriation without compensation… unless I need my head read, I would not go there. So we’re not breaking ranks, but we think that we need to be very careful,” says Buthelezi. Click link for more:
