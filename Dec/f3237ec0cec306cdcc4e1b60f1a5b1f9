Political analyst, Sethulego Matebesi, has questioned the credibility of ANC Chairperson Gwede Mantashe‘s testimony at the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture. During his appearance at the Commission this week, Mantashe claimed that instances of state capture came about during former president Jacob Zuma’s second term of office. Mantashe, who was the first top ANC official to appear before the commission, says some party leaders began to resist state capture and called for Zuma’s resignation during a National Executive Committee meeting earlier this year. Matebesi says several ANC leaders allowed state capture to continue over the years. “With Gwede Mantashe, he is always sitting on the fence – it depends on where the wind is blowing. Mantashe, for me, has never been credible. We’ve seen sometimes he was anti-Zuma and immediately he back tracked if he got a tongue-lashing from the ANC’s NEC. But I strongly believe people like him promoted and allowed this to continue.” Watch related testimony:
