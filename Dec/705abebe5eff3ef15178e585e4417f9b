Crime fighting efforts in the Eastern Cape have been given a boost with 800 new recruits added to the province’s police service this weekend. They recently graduated alongside other recruits countrywide.  From humble beginnings, Sikelelwa Ntsokolo finally landed her dream job in the South African Police Service (SAPS). Ntsokolo says the new opportunity is a breakthrough and the much needed stability her family needed. “Joining  SAPS has changed my lifestyle. My family, especially my mom, because we have suffered a lot. But ever since I joined SAPS I’m now able to provide everything  for my family, for my mom and my child at school.” Acting Provincial Commissioner Major General Andre Swart says the recruits have a challenging task ahead of fighting crime and serving the community with integrity. “This day is important because they know we have got to serve people with integrity. But we have discretion and if I exercise the wrong discretion and it has far reaching implications for us as a  service. We are trying to get them to a point where they understand that this is a formal induction.” The recruits will commence their duties next month at various police stations across the province.
