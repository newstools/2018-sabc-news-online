The Greater Tshwane African National Congress (ANC) Council Caucus says it will be opening a case of racism against Democratic Alliance (DA) leader in Gauteng, Fred Nel, at the Brooklyn police station in Pretoria Monday afternoon. The Tshwane ANC chair, Dr Kgosi Maepa, says the racism charges against the DA provincial leader allegedly emanates from intercepted racist emails exchanged between Nel and other members of the party. During the press briefing, some of the emails allegedly target Tshwane DA leader, Abel Tau. Maepa called on Tau to join the ANC when laying the charges against Nel. The ANC also called on Tshwaneâ€™s Executive Mayor, Solly Msimanga, to distance himself from the DA and resign from the party.
