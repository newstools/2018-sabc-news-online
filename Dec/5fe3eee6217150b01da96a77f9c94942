There is a huge traffic backlog on the N3 near the Pavilion Mall in Durban after a diesel tanker overturned on Thursday. Durban Metro police spokesperson Parboo Sewpersad says clean-up operations are underway. Sewpersad has urged motorists to use alternative routes and the police are investigating the cause of the crash. “Right now the authorities are on scene and the recovery team has recovered the truck but there is, however huge diesel spillage on the scene. They are trying to clean up on the roadway. The spillage will take approximately two hours to clean up and make the road surface safe for the vehicles to travel. There’s a major congestion on the N3 at the Pavilion turn off, traffic is being diverted. However I urge the motorists to use any alternative besides Spine road to get to their destinations.”
