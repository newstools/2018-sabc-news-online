Victims of Listeriosis represented by their lawyers will be approaching the High Court in Johannesburg on Monday to certify their litigation as a class action against Tiger Brands. The company has already announced that it will not oppose the lawsuit. The outbreak, which lasted from about the middle of last year until March this year, caused 218 recorded deaths and left more than 1-thousand people seriously ill. One of the victims, Montlha Ngobeni says she hopes victims will be compensated. “My only hope is that these lawsuits will go well – they’ll compensate us so that we can be able to take care of ourselves, especially me taking care of a hydrocephellus baby… due to this hydrocephellus – it is chronic, if they want to do the right thing yes they won’t oppose this, we are just waiting for the class action to the be certified on Monday then we’ll take it from there.” Tiger Brands Communications Director Nevashnee Naicker says they’ll continue to work closely with the claimants. “From the onset, Tiger Brands committed to managing this process with honesty and integrity; our company legal representatives have been working closely with the attorneys for the claimants… not only are we not opposing the class action, we have been supporting to expedite the matter – we want to bring closure to all parties particularly the victims as soon as possible.” Watch for more:
