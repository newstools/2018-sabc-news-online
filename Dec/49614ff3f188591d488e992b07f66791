Former African National Congress MP Vytjie Mentor has postponed her testimony at the State Capture Inquiry. The Commission of Inquiry into State Capture was expected to resume in Parktown, Johannesburg on Tuesday morning. The Commission is expected to have a media briefing later Tuesday. Former ANC MP Vytjie Mentor was also scheduled to return to the commission on November 30, but the commission’s legal team told the chairperson of the commission, Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo that there are aspects of her testimony which need to be addressed before she reappears and gives her evidence. There are also three applications to cross-examine Mentor, by implicated persons. Meanwhile, Mentor previously apologised to businessman Fana Hlongwane for implicating him into allegations of State Capture. In a leaked letter from Mentor’s lawyers to the commission, the former ANC MP revealed that after she gave her testimony at the commission, she googled pictures of Hlongwane on the internet and upon reflection realised it was not the same person former president Jacob Zuma’s son Duduzane Zuma had introduced her to while on board an Emirates flight.
