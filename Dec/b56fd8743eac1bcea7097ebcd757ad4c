Eskom says there will be no loadshedding on Sunday as it has recovered sufficient levels and some generating units have returned to service. On Monday, the power utility announced a high probability of stage stage two of loadshedding due to its power generation plants going through maintenance. Eskom Spokesperson, Khulu Phasiwe says they continue to urge residents and businesses to use electricity sparingly during this period. “The power system has marginally improved from where it was yesterday and during the course of the week. As a result of this improvement, we are not going to have loadshedding today. The system operator is saying, if we have any new breakdown then clearly that will bring the power system under severe constraint and therefore, we might have to revive our position but so far, if things do not breakdown, we should be going through today with no loadshedding at all,” says Phasiwe.
