The two-day bus strike by Autopax workers is over. Workers at Autopax, which operates City-to-City and Translux buses, stopped working on Wednesday. They were aggrieved by a change to their salary rate for Sunday work. The Passenger Rail Agency (PRASA) which is the holding company for Autopax intervened and an agreement was reached to reverse the change. Close to 4 000 bus commuters had been left stranded by the bus strike. The South African Transport and Allied Workers Union (Satawu) says their members are back at work. Satawu’s Zanele Sabela explains: “The workers at Autopax actually went back to work on Thursday afternoon after a meeting with the Group CEO of Prasa. After it was decided that their outstanding monies will be paid on Friday. And that the Group CEO will meet with them again on the 17th of January to discuss their grievances, because they were very unhappy with what was happening at the company.” Click on video below:
