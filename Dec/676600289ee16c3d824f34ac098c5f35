Economists from the private sector and academic institutions, including Harvard University in the United States (US), have been listening to government’s policy proposals aimed at boosting South Africa’s economic growth, at a colloquium called by Finance minister Tito Mboweni. The outcome of the colloquium will form the basis of economic policy proposals to be submitted to Cabinet in the New Year. Minister Mboweni says government now has to think out of the box to grow the economy and yield positive results. “We wouldn’t have convened such a large number of bright people if we were not certain that something is going to come out of it. Something is going to come out of it… I don’t know what that thing is, and it may be something for further conversations, and in the nature of these things a conversation never stops – and certain actions need to be done in order to achieve certain results,” says Mboweni.
