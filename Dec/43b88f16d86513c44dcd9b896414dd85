The City of Cape Town intends to lodge a complaint against the security company Professional Protection Alternative (PPA), which is alleged to have chased beach-goers off Clifton’s Fourth Beach last week, saying the beach closes at 8pm. The complaint will be laid with the Private Security Industry Regulatory Authority (PSIRA), which is the regulatory authority for the private security industry. Law enforcement authorities as well as the private security company have denied closing the beach. The City will also be pursuing charges against those who slaughtered a sheep on the beach as part of a cleansing ceremony, as well as those who prevented law enforcement officials from taking action against the slaughtering. “We were disturbed to discover that the persons complaining about the conduct of PSIRA who have made so much politics about this, have in fact failed to lay charges with the industry regulatory authority. So the City will also proceed to do that on the 1st, to make sure that the matter is properly investigated, that we get to the bottom of what happened – so that much of the misinformation and defamation of the City can definitely dealt with and we can get to the bottom of it,” says City’s JP Smith. Meanwhile, the Freedom Front Plus (FF Plus) says what happened at Clifton Fourth beach in Cape Town, shows the poor policing in the metro. They say the events show that policing by the metro police, is deteriorating. The FF Plus says this is clear from the decay in the inner city with shacks being erected in areas close to Parliament, the Company Gardens and the Castle of Good Hope. Meanwhile – the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) says it will be holding a peaceful protest at the Beach on Sunday afternoon. Authors- Berenice Moss and Zaelene Merrington
