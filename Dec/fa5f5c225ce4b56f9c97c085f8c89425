Former City of Cape Town mayor, Patricia de Lille, says land expropriation without compensation should be government’s last resort. The Constitutional Review Committee report has recommended that Section 25 of the constitution be amended to allow for the expropriation of land without compensation. De Lille explains, “Public land is for the public good. Public land is not a commodity to be privatised and traded with in government. Its first purpose must be to serve the public good. Our constitution provides for expropriation of land. Given the significant public land holdings, land expropriation should be our last resort. There is a duty on all land owners to become part of developing a solution that we are seeking for our country.” Speaking during a media briefing in Johannesburg, De Lille announced that ‘Good‘ was the name of her new political party. The party is expected to contest the 2019 elections in all provinces. Watch related video:
