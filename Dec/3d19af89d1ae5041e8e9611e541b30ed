Gauteng Community Safety MEC Sizakele Nkosi-Malobane has urged law enforcement agencies to declare a zero tolerance approach to motorists who display unbecoming behaviour. She says they should do the same against their members who solicit bribes from drivers. This follows a spate of road crashes over this past long weekend. About 34 people died, 15 of them pedestrians in 31 crashes recorded between Friday and Monday night. This comes as holiday-makers prepare to leave for various destinations. Drunk driving has been highlighted as a major concern. The MEC’s spokesperson Ofentse Morwane says many roadblocks will be conducted. “It is the MEC’s view that the number of fatalities reported over the long weekend are unacceptably high. And therefore it’s important the we continue to maintain high visibility of law enforcement officers in highways and places of entertainment. The MEC has also appealed to public transport operators to ensure that the lives of passengers are a priority by ensuring that their vehicles are roadworthy and that their drivers are fit to drive and they comply with the rules of the road.” Watch related videos:
