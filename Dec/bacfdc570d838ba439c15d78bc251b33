The Department of International Relations and Cooperation (Dirco) says it is willing to assist Indonesia following the tsunami that killed over 280 people and injured more than 1 000 on Saturday. Rescuers are battling heavy rains in a desperate search for survivors. Hundreds of buildings were destroyed by the wave when the Anak Krakatau volcano, known as the “child” of the legendary Krakatoa, erupted. People have been warned of the possibility of another tsunami, due to the continued volcanic eruptions. The department’s spokesperson, Ndivhuwo Mabaya, says that at this stage they are not aware of South Africans that have been affected. “Our mission in Jakarta has been monitoring the rescue operations to check if there are any South Africans involved, but also to see if there is any assistance required.” “The last time when there was a tsunami like this, the NGO Gift of the Givers, also assisted there. We are always ready to assist them. We are making sure no South Africans are there and if there is a need for us to assist South Africans, we will be on standby,” says Mabaya.
