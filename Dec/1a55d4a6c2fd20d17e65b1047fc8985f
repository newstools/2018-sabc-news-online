The widow of former senior Gauteng ANC official Khabisi Mosunkutu has described her husband as a man of integrity who loved to serve his country and its people. Mosunkutu died on Monday at the age of 69. The cause of death has not yet been released but he had suffered a stroke in July. Mosunkutu resigned from the provincial legislature in 2011 after more than a decade as a member of the executive in various portfolios. He served as an MEC for community safety, for public transport, roads and works and for the department of agriculture, conservation and environment. Nonqaba Mosunkutu says she will miss her husband. She says: “He has been a wonderful husband, very supportive in everything that I was doing. We’d never say he’s a politician, he was a family man.” “He got a stroke last year and he was admitted to the Chris Hani Baragwanath hospital but we thank God, we are a little bit consoled because the nation is praying for the family,” she adds.
