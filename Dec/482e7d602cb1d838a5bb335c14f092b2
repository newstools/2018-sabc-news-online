Condolences are pouring in for South African paramedic and rescue worker Mark Roxburgh who was killed in a helicopter crash in Ras al-Khaimah in the North-Eastern region of the United Arab Emirates. Roxburgh and three other Emirates crew members died when the helicopter crashed while on a rescue mission, allegedly clipping the ‘the world’s highest zip line’ on the UAE’s highest mountain, Jebel Jais, in the crash. On his social media Roxburgh writes that for as long as he can remember, his dad taught him about self-sacrifice in the service of those in need. Roxburgh’s sister, Lindy-Lee Felix, confirmed her brother’s death and describes him as a strong, courageous and selfless man. She says he’ll be remembered as a loving uncle, son and brother and a passionate father. Friends and colleagues have taken to social media to offer their condolences to Roxburgh’s family and share memories of the medic they knew and the man they respected. These colleagues remember him as a special person with a positive energy, empathy and kindness. Emergency service workers also took the opportunity to reflect on other losses over recent months. They say 2018 has taken its toll on the industry, with too many good people lost in the line of duty, so that others may live.
