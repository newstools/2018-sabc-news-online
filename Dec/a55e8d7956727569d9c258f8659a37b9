South African Federation of Trade Unions (Saftu) General Secretary, Zwelinzima Vavi, says President Cyril Ramaphosa must be congratulated for the no salary increase to certain public office bearers – saying they don’t need or deserve any increases. He was responding to Ramaphosa’s decision not to increase the salaries of his cabinet, deputy ministers, premiers, MECs and senior presiding officers in Parliament and Provincial Legislatures. Ramphosa’s decision comes despite the 4% across the board increase recommended by the Independent Commission for the Remuneration of Public Office Bearers. “The government, President, all of them do not need an increase and bearing in mind that most of them are very busy and hectic in the business world. And quite a few workers who have lost their jobs will say that they didn’t deserve any increase in the light of what is happening with the Eskom crisis, SABC crisis, SAA crisis and crisis everywhere else that they had to generate from the people of the country. But nevertheless we think this is a very good signal. We want to congratulate them for taking that decision,” says Vavi. READ THE PRESIDENCY STATEMENT BELOW:
