The Water and Sanitation Department has warned communities affected by drought about the continued decrease of dam levels and possible reduction in water supply. The levels are currently standing at 67.3% less compared to last week, which was at 68.4%, because of extreme temperatures and a lack of rainfall in some areas. In the North West, the Kgetleng Revier Local Municipality is unable to provide residents of Swartregguns and surrounding areas with water as the local dam has hit a low of 6.4%. Municipal manager Joseph Mogale says they are coping with the situation by putting in place contingency plans. “Our short term plan is to ensure that we provide water to the community through tankers and financially it is a constraint because what we did, we had to go out and get service providers whom will come and assist us for short term plans. Our medium term plans are to also to ensure that we abstract water from the dolomitic area to the water treatment plant. The long term plans that we have obviously is the Pilanesburg water scheme.”
