Traffic volumes leaving the popular holiday destination of KwaZulu-Natal are expected to increase from Friday as thousands of holiday makers return home before the New Year. Transport Minister Blade Nzimande will visit the Tugela Toll Plaza to monitor operations as part of road safety awareness campaigns. Petrol stations on the N3 leaving Durban towards Johannesburg are jam packed with cars, trailers and buses packed to capacity. There are long queues for early morning breakfast runs on the go. Holiday makers are likely to return home earlier than usual with schools opening early next year, on January 9th. There have been a number of road crashes reported on the N3 towards the vicinity of Howick in the KwaZulu-Natal midlands on Friday morning. This was largely due to inclement weather conditions across the province. Meanwhile, according to the N3 Toll Concession, traffic volumes leaving the province remains manageable at this stage. Road Incident Assistant Manager, Praveen Sundarlall says: “We have got moderate traffic that’s leaving the province in the west bound carriage way typically known as the north bound heading out of the province towards Gauteng. On the south bound which is the east bound we’ve got very low traffic volumes at this stage. However, in the vicinity of Howick we had a multiple vehicle accidents this morning luckily there were minor injuries. That scene has been cleared and the weather conditions in the Howick area is overcast with light rain earlier we just want to caution motorists to please adhere to the rules of the road, drive safely and get to your destination in time and obviously safely as well.” WATCH RELATED VIDEOS BELOW:
