Eskom says the probability of load shedding remains low until January the 13th – but it’s warned that this could change if there are heavy rains. The utility says closure of businesses over the holiday season will take some pressure off the power grid. However, it says heavy rain in December and January could impact on coal handling and feeding to the boilers, with a consequent effect on generation production.   This could in turn increase the possibility of load shedding. Eskom’s also warned that local outages could occur due to technical faults rather than load shedding.
