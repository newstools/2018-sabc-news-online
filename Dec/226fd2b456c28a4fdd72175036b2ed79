The 43-year-old suspect accused of killing nine-year-old Miguel Louw has been denied bail at the Durban Magistrate court. Mohammad Ebrahim is facing charges of murder, kidnapping and theft. He allegedly kidnapped and killed Miguel in July. The boy’s decomposed body was found near Ebrahim’s home in Verulam, north of Durban. Refusing bail, the magistrate ruled that the accused had failed to prove to the court that he had exceptional circumstances to justify releasing him on bail.
