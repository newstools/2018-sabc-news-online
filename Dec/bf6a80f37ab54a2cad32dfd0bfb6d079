The Desmond and Leah Tutu Legacy Foundation has bid farewell to over 50 youths who graduated from this year’s Youth@Work Programme. The eight month programme is a response to the high levels of youth unemployment. It targets youths between the ages of 17-20 years who have completed matric but are unable to find employment or further their studies. The Foundation’s Chief Executive Officer, Razaan Bailey says the youths are given the knowledge and skills that can help them to identify and take steps towards the realisation of their personal and professional goals. “What is it that we do to invest in our future in the same way we invest our money so that in our future we can have a nice retirement. In these future leaders what investment are we making in their lives,  how do we actually contribute to this group of leaders that we want to see in our society. The young people who we say will take over and will actually continue the work that we have started.” The young people have expressed their gratitude to the Desmond and Leah Tutu Foundation for helping them gain valuable skills. The graduation ceremony in Cape Town was attended by both the Archbishop Emeritus and Mrs Tutu. Darne Hendricks is one of those who took part in this year’s programme. “For me it was one of the most important year of my life. Finding myself and knowing who I am. I would say it was eye opening for me, meaning we should not take life for granted but grab each and every opportunity that comes our way.”
