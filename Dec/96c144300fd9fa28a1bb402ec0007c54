2019 is going to be an important year for South Africa with national and provincial elections expected to take place in the first half of the year. For some political parties in Parliament, it means there’s a possibility that they won’t return if they don’t win enough votes to translate into representation in the National Assembly. The Year 2018 has been eventful and busy in Parliament. From postponing SONA, to fist fights and the National Assembly discussing ground-breaking legislation such as land expropriation without compensation. 2019 is sure not to lack any fireworks, with elections lined up. IFP leader, Mangosuthu Buthelezi says he hopes that the New Year will bring new behaviour in Parliament. “Hoping we won’t be going in the same spirit, because I have seen in Parliament that we go beyond what is robust debate and then hurl insults at each other.” The term of the fifth Parliament ends after the first quarter of the year. Then electioneering will be in full swing. NFP Chief whip, Nhlanhla Kubisa and ACDP leader, Kenneth Meshoe has messages for their colleagues and counterparts. Nhlanhla Kubisa says, “The upcoming year is very serious … hope, as NFP and other parties, we will have vibrant and robust campaigning, but understand that we are working for the poor in South Africa.” Kenneth Meshoe says, “Wishing politicians a time of rationality, peaceful in campaigning. Overall, we wish for South Africa, a peaceful, prosperous year.” Freedom Front Plus leader, Pieter Groenewald and UDM Chief Whip, Nqaba Kwankwa have reminded South Africans that they have an important responsibility in 2019. EFF MP Hlengiwe Mkhalipi says South Africans have an interesting year ahead. “It is the year of the land, going to vote in May. It’s the year of the land being returned and also jobs for people.” An optimistic ANC Chief Whip, Jackson Mthembu wished enough rest for politicians.
