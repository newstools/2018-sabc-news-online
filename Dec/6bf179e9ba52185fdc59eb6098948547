It is expected that ten women from inside the African National Congress (ANC) are to testify before the panel investigating charges of sexual harassment against party national Spokesperson, Pule Mabe. The panel is currently sitting following allegations by Mabe’s personal assistant. The South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) understands that the exact nature of the relationship between the complainant and Mabe is under scrutiny. Some people at Luthuli House believe that there may have been a romantic relationship between the two before she started working for Mabe. Some staffers have also told the SABC that they believe that the matter should not just be treated purely as a Human Resources issue but also look at matters of power and sex in the corridors of Luthuli House. ANC Internal Grievance Panel The ANC’s Internal Grievance Panel is hearing the case after Mabe’s 26 year old assistant cited two incidents in which she says she resisted Mabe’s advances. The party says it will ensure emotional and psychological support is provided to the victim. Acting ANC spokesperson, Dakota Legoete says, “The victim brought a grievance against the spokesperson. The victim was a PA of the spokesperson when she brought the allegations. “The panel is composed of Sdumo Dlamini as the chair. Thoko Didiza is the co-chair. Both are here with their witnesses. Once the evidence and assessments are done, there will be an outcome and the process is expected to be concluded soon, maybe in 7 days,” Legoete explained. Watch a related video below:
