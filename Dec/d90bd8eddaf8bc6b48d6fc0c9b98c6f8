The Nelson Mandela and Albertina Sisulu centenary celebrations culminated in a Mandela Remembrance Walk and Run in Pretoria on Sunday. Over 30 000 runners participated in the 5, 10 and 21 kilometre race categories.  The Mandela Remembrance Walk and Run began five years ago, shortly after the passing of the former statesman.  The Remembrance Run was meant to inculcate Madiba’s principles of reconciliation, unity and selflessness. The Mandela and Sisulu families welcomed the outstanding support. The number of participants this year show the event is growing. Watch a related video below:
