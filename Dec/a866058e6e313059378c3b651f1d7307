The number of deaths on roads in three coastal provinces over the long weekend has risen to over 80. This as the death toll in crashes in the Eastern Cape over the long weekend has risen to at least 28 after six people died in a head-on collision on the R61 road near Mt Nicholas in Libode on Sunday night. It’s alleged that a sedan with six occupants collided with a fully loaded minibus taxi. The six occupants from the sedan, an adult and five children were declared dead on the scene while  14 occupants from the taxi sustained injuries. The deceased were apparently all related.  Eastern Cape Transport spokesperson Unathi Binqose says the injured have been rushed to St Barnabas hospital in Libode. “The main cause of this accident is still under investigation but it’s indicated that speed may have been a major contributing factor. When we woke up this morning about 22 people perished since the beginning of this weekend on Friday and with these stats now that takes the number to 28. It’s very disturbing. We urge our motorists to be extra vigilant and extra cautious.” The Western Cape has reported 34 fatalities over the holiday weekend while 19 fatalities were reported in KwaZulu-Natal. Human error such as speeding, fatigue driving and walking under the influence of alcohol have been cited as the major contributing factors in these incidents. WATCH RELATED VIDEO BELOW:
