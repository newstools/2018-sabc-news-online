The deadline for nominations of candidates to fill the vacancies of eight SABC non-executive board members has just lapsed. The public had until four on Friday afternoon to either nominate themselves or nominate suitable persons to fill eight vacancies in the board. The next step will be to shortlist and interview candidates for the position. The SABC board has been left without a quorum after four non-executive board members resigned recently, bringing the number of vacancies to eight. The board only has four non-executive directors left. Parliament’s Communications Committee Chairperson Hlengiwe Mkhize says the committee will resume in the next few weeks to start searching for the best candidates. “According to the programme of MPs they said they will set a date through a whippery from Mid-January around the 18th of January.” “So we are hoping to get the exact date as soon as possible.” It’s hoped that the interviewing process and the final approval of the recommended candidates by the National Assembly will have been concluded in February.
