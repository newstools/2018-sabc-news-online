Four more lives have been lost in a crash on the Madikwe road leading to Zeerust in the North West. Provincial public safety spokesperson Thabo Sematle says a mini bus taxi travelling from Botswana collided with a bakkie. The accident happened in less than a week after 13 people were killed during a crash between Zeerust and Mahikeng last week. Sematle says all the four deceased in the latest crash are from Botswana. “It is alleged that the mini bus did not stop at the stop sign and the mini bus was carrying about 10 people and four of them after the collision where confirmed dead on the spot and after the particular head on collision.” In Limpopo two people have been killed and several others injured in a crash along the R521 between Polokwane and Dendron. It is alleged that a truck and a sedan collided head-on. The truck has blocked the road. Provincial traffic spokesperson Matome Moremi has advised motorists to exercise patience, as there is no alternative route. In another incident, the N1 between Mokopane and Mookgopong has been closed following a crash in which one person died. Moremi says details are still sketchy. Eastern Cape traffic authorities say seven people were killed and seven others seriously injured when the taxi they were travelling in overturned on the R61 between Cradock and Tarkastad in the early hours of Saturday. The taxi had brought the 14 passengers from Cape Town. There were three children among those killed and two among the injured. In the Free State one person has been killed and one injured after a truck overturned on the N3 north of Villiers. WATCH RELATED VIDEO BELOW:
