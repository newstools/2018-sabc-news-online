The man responsible for murdering three-year-old Courtney Pieters will know his fate next week. Sentencing procedures for Mortimor Saunders concluded in the High Court in Cape Town on Monday. Pieters’ body was found buried in a shallow grave at an industrial site in the city, nine days after she went missing. Saunders was Courtney’s father’s best friend and a trusted member of the household. He poisoned, choked and raped her last year. Despite his gruesome crime, he joined in a nine day long search for the little girl. On Tuesday, more witnesses took the stand as pre-sentencing procedures started. The probation officer, counsellor who compiled the victim impact report and the warrant officer also took the stand. The probation officer says although Saunders admitted to killing the child, he got the sense that he did not take full responsibility for his action. He denies the murder was premeditated. The family has thanked the community for their support and sentencing will take place next week Tuesday. Watch related videos:
