Japanese prosecutors re-arrested Nissan Motor’s ousted chairman Carlos Ghosn on Friday (December 21) on fresh allegations of making Nissan shoulder $16.6 million in personal investment losses, dashing chances he would be released on bail imminently. The move came a day after a Tokyo court unexpectedly rejected prosecutors’ request to extend Ghosn’s detention, which raised the possibility that he could go free on bail as early as Friday. The re-arrest means he could be detained for at least another 10 days in a Tokyo detention centre, where he has been confined since he was arrested last month on initial allegations of financial misconduct. The Tokyo prosecutor said the new allegations were based on suspicions that around October 2008, Ghosn shifted personal trades to the automaker so that he could avoid paying for 1.85 billion yen ($16.6 million) in losses. His lawyer was not available for comment. Ghosn was initially arrested on November 19 for allegedly understating his income over a five-year period from 2010.
