Johannesburg Emergency Services has urged residents to avoid direct exposure to the sun to minimise the impact of a heatwave that is ravaging the city. Temperatures are expected to test the 35 degree mark in the city of gold on the Day of Goodwill. Other cities are also feeling the effects of the heatwave that has the interior of the country in its grip. The mercury has tested the 40 degrees mark in Potchefstroom and Kimberly. “Heatwave is expected to hit most parts of Johannesburg today (Tuesday) and tomorrow (Wednesday). I’d just like to urge all our residents to stay hydrated, drink lots of water, try and avoid direct sunlight between 11 and three,” says EMS Spokesperson Robert Mulaudzi.
