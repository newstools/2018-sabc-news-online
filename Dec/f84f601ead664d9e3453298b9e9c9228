Former Sports Minister Fikile Mbalula says he did not breach any provisions of the Constitution and the Executive Members Ethics Code Act by undertaking a paid for family trip to Dubai. Mbalula was responding to Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane’s findings that he had violated Ethics Code by undertaking trip to Dubai in 2016 which was not paid by him. Mbalula says the Public Protector’s findings are unsubstantiated and prejudicial. He went on to say he “strongly” denies the findings. According to reports Mbalula’s trip came to about R680 000. Further allegations were that an estimated sum of about R380 000 was delivered to Mbalula in cash once he arrived in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Mkhwebane says Mbalula’s conduct was a gross violation of the Constitution and the Executives Code of Ethics.
