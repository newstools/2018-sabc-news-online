Johannesburg Mayor Herman Mashaba has opened a criminal case against former city mayor Parks Tau and former Member of the Mayoral Committee, Geoff Makhubo. Mashaba is accusing the pair of having orchestrated R30 million out of lucrative deals within the city. The charges include fraud, corruption, maladministration, money laundering and racketeering. Herman Mashaba says:”We were overwhelmed by the volumes of complaints over fraud and maladministration. “Over time I came of the view that there was no way that this level of criminal looting could have taken place without the knowledge of the former leadership of the city and the leadership of the ANC. Every effort to combat fraud and corruption has been oppressed by the ANC in council. Now we know why.” Related video click below:
