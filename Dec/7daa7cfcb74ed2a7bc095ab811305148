Parliament says the National Council of Provinces (NCOP) will resume early in January for a special sitting to consider and process the Electoral Laws Amendment Bill. This comes after the NCOP’s Social Services Committee adopted the Bill on Friday without any amendments. The Bill will be brought to the NCOP for debate and to seek the final approval of the House before sending it to the President to sign it into law. The Bill was first passed by the National Assembly more than three weeks ago and sent to the NCOP for concurrence. “The Bill essentially amends the Electoral Commissions Act, the Electoral Act and the Local Government Municipal Electoral Act. Among other things, it makes it illegal for public funds to be used for political campaigning and makes sure that voters whose addresses aren’t yet on the voters roll still will be able to cast a ballot. So, with this committee  having met today and adopted this bill, the National Council of Provinces will meet on the 10th of January 2019 at 12 o’ clock to consider this Bill,” says Parliament’s Spokesperson Moloto Mothapo.
