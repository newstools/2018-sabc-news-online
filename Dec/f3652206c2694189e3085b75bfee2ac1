Khabisi Mosunkutu’s widow has called on politicians and leaders to emulate her husband’s sense of integrity. The call comes after Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane’s recent report puts former Sports minister Fikile Mbalula and Western Cape Premier Helen Zille in the firing line. Mbalula and his family allegedly took a trip to Dubai to the value of more than R600 000. An investigation has been ordered to uncover the source of the funds. Zille allegedly violated the executive members’ code of ethics after she facilitated the use of provincial government’s software and educational resources for her son’s company during recent revision workshops for learners. Pastor Nonqaba Mosunkutu says over the years her husband demonstrated unparalleled ethics in the execution of his duties. She says: “Everybody now is talking about politicians being corrupt, he was a man who was straight. He would not do anything apart from what he has been appointed for.” “You know as MECs they will be assigned to go overseas, he would say to me I don’t want us to go together because people will think that we are using taxpayers money. Ever since he was an MEC, we did not take even a single trip together overseas where he was assigned by the government. I would like to say to all of us let us take after him.” says Mosunkutu.
