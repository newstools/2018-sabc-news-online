Another initiate has died at Maluti in the north of the Eastern Cape. This is the 15th initiate to die in the province since the launch of the summer initiation season, and the fourth death in the Alfred Nzo district. It’s alleged that the 17 year-old initiate was suffering from diarrhoea and vomiting. Eastern Cape Traditional Affairs spokesperson, Mamkeli Ngam says they are waiting for post-mortem results to establish the exact cause of death. “The department of Cogta in the Eastern Cape province confirms that the number of initiates who have passed away has increased to 15.” “Cogta MEC FB Xasa wishes to send his heartfelt condolences to the bereaved families for the loss of their loved ones and he would also want to encourage family members and community members to work together to ensure the safe passage of our boys to manhood,” adds Ngam.
