Political analysts say political veteran and former Cape Town Mayor Patricia De Lille will fare well with her new party in 2019’s general elections. Earlier on Sunday, De Lille announced that her new party ‘Good’ will be launched in January 2019 when its election manifesto and premier candidates will be announced. Leadership expert Dr Mazwe Majola says De Lille is set to take a substantial amount of votes away from the Democratic Alliance (DA) from which she resigned in November. He adds that other parties would have faired well to form a coalition with De Lille to garner the support she has amongst the voters, especially in the Cape provinces. Majola says the DA will be paralysed by De Lille in the 2019 elections. “She will be moving away from DA and she will be taking a lot of voters. They showed support, especially in Cape Town, Western Cape, and in Northern Cape and that is where the DA wants to canvass. This is where the DA are setting their eye on. So, the DA is going to be severely paralysed by the new party of Patricia de Lille. She possesses the ability to bounce back from setbacks.” Click link for more on the story:
