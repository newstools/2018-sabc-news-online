Deputy Minister of Transport, Sindisiwe Chikunga, says the increasing number of fatal accidents in this festive season is a cause for a concern. Chikunga was on a Safety festive campaign at Bochum in Limpopo. She also interacted with families of the 26 people who died in the N1 accident in October. The people were killed when a 22 seater bus collided with a truck, two bakkies and a Sedan. Their families received food parcels for Christmas 26. Meanwhile, traffic officials  are still  mending the busy roads. Unroadworthy vehicles, expired permits and overloaded vehicles are quite common offenses. Some were arrested for being in the country illegally and others others got away with fines when few were impounded. Traffic is expected to increase on  Monday on all the major roads in the country. The Beitbridge border post experiences high traffic volumes during this time of the year. Watch video below:
