ANC Chief Whip Jackson Mthembu says one of the lowest points for Parliament this year was the physical fight between Agang Parliamentary Leader Andries Tlouamma and Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) MP Nazeer Paulsen. A scuffle ensued between Paulsen and Tlouamma when chaos broke out during President Cyril Ramaphosa’s last oral reply session in the National Assembly for this year. The two have since been referred to the Parliamentary Disciplinary committee. Mthembu spoke in an interview with SABC News in parliament to reflect on some of the high and low points this year. “In fact, it was the lowest light because it has never happened in this parliament, except when two (MPs) Johnny De lange and (Manie) Schoeman fought some years ago. In this instance, apart from people engaging in fists, the language that was used… very racist, very polarising – and giving not a good reflection of Parliament to the people outside there in South Africa, in the continent, in the world.”
