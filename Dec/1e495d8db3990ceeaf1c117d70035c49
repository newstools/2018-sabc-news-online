The national police management says driving under the influence of alcohol remains a major contributory factor to the country’s road carnage.  Since the launch of their Festive Season Safety operation in Port Elizabeth on November 1 – the South African Police Service (SAPS) says it has found that speeding and exhaustion also contributes to road crashes. National police spokesperson, Vishnu Naidoo, says police will be out in full force to deal with crime during the holiday season. “Remember for this period we have adopted a six pillar approach which is your aggravated robberies particularly cash in transit heists. You’ve seen in May this year they were happening on a daily basis now we’ve managed to reduce them to once a month or once in two months. We also looking at crimes against women, children and people with disabilities. We are looking at the proliferation of firearms and ammunition, border controls and liquor outlets.”
