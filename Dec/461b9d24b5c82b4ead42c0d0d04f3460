The civil society group SOS Coalition has warned the new Communications Minister Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams that she may be acting unlawfully by meddling in SABC affairs. The cash-strapped SABC is facing more problems with speculations of at least three board members reportedly stepping down amid allegations of political pressure. The route of the problem is over whether the program to retrench employees should continue. Organisations, SOS coalition and Media Monitoring Africa are calling on those board members to rescind their resignations and for the minister to resume communication with the board. National Coordinator Duduetsang Makuse says the Communications Minister has a role to exercise through Parliament to try and keep the broadcaster alive. “Everybody needs to calm down and consider the fact that they are looking at the possibility of a public broadcaster actually shutting down this time around.” Makuse says that this is the biggest crisis the SABC has faced in the democratic era.
