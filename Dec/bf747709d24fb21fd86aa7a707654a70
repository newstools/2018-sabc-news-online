Parliament’s Portfolio Committee on Environmental Affairs says it will summon the City of Cape Town and the Professional Protection Alternatives (PPA) Security company over the alleged removal of beach-goers from Clifton’s fourth beach last week. On Friday night, lobby group, the Black People’s National Crisis Committee held a protest at Clifton Beach, saying they want to cleanse it of what they call “racist spirits”. The Environmental Affairs Committee says it will do so as soon as Parliament resumes business in the new year. It says the Integrated Coastal Management (ICM) Act secures equitable access to South Africa’s coast line and is public property. It further states that the ICM Act also makes it clear that it is the duty of the State to ensure that coastal public property is protected and conserved in the interest of the whole community as opposed to only a few individuals or groups. Activists, who’ve staged a protest at Clifton’s Fourth Beach amid a furore over access to the beach, have deemed their protest action successful. The group slaughtered a sheep on the beach as part of a cleansing ceremony. Animal rights activists have slammed the slaughter of the sheep as cruelty to animals. A protest picnic has been planned at the beach on Saturday by some people who were among those allegedly told to clear the beach last Sunday.
