A number of families in the Buffalo City Metro are struggling to bury their loved ones as South African Municipal Workers’ Union (Samwu) members continue with their unprotected strike in the Eastern Cape-based metro. The workers, including cemetery workers, downed tools two weeks ago demanding the implementation of a job evaluation process and bonuses ahead of Christmas. The municipality says it had agreed to pay the workers their bonuses, but they are now demanding R100 000 each as a token of apology for the unfinished job evaluation process. The situation has degenerated to the point where waste is also  not collected and water and electricity are cut off regularly. Meanwhile, Samwu says it is determined to continue with the strike until the R100 000 apology is paid to each worker.
