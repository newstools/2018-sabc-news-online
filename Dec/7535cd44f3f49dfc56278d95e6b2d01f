The situation remains calm in Westbury, west of Johannesburg Thursday morning following days of protest. On Wednesday, community members blocked several roads in the area. The protest followed the release from custody of two suspects arrested for the murder of Westbury mother, Heather Peterson.  Police say the charges against the suspects were dropped due to lack of evidence linking them to the crime. Two community leaders were also arrested yesterday and charged with public violence and incitement. Gauteng police spokesperson Kay Makhubele says that police will continue to monitor the area. “The situation is calm and the roads are opened. Motorists are travelling safely. Police have been deployed and we will continue monitoring the area.” Watch associated video below:
