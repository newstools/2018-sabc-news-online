The chairperson of the Inter-Ministerial Task Team into government’s intervention in the North West, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, says several incidents of corruption have been uncovered in the province. President Cyril Ramaphosa established the task team after the former premier Supra Mahumapelo was forced to step down. The entire provincial government was placed under the administration of national government after cabinet found that the North West could not fulfill its executive obligations. Dlamini-Zuma says various stakeholders worked around the clock to normalise the situation. She says they have given police evidence of criminal activity. “We have also looked at corruption issues. We have about 46 cases that had been handed over to the police which are now at various stages of investigation. I think some of them may be going to the court roll and so on. So we have handed those to the police.” Dlamini-Zuma says most of the work to stabilise the province’s health department has been completed. Violent protests and strikes had severely affected service delivery at hospitals and clinics in the province earlier this year. Some healthcare workers were afraid to go to work due to safety concerns. Dlamini-Zuma says a lot has been achieved so far. “There is distribution of medicine and drugs and all the pharmaceutical things that hospitals and clinics need. As you recall the depot, there was a problem at the depot. So stuff wasn’t moving out into the hospitals and clinics. That has been resolved. We are now at 80% availability at any one time of all medicines.”  Watch related video below:
