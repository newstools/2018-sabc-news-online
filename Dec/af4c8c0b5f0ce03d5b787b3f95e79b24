The funeral service of a Limpopo ward councillor who criticised the municipality he was part of for investing in VBS Bank, is underway at Riba Cross near Burgersfort. Forty-two-year-old Thabang  Maupa, who served on the Greater Fetakgomo-Tubatse municipality, was shot dead late last month. The municipality had deposited more than R200 million at the now liquidated VBS mutual bank. Local police say they are following leads in Maupa’s killing. Family spokesperson Josheph Maupafamily says they have been in pain since the shooting. “That pain was very strong, because the way they killed him… we are so shocked for the last two previous weeks but we are trying to be strong – then we take him to rest in peace. There’s no arrest so far.” Click link for more:
