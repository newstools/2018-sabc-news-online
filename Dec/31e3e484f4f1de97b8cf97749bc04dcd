President Cyril Ramaphosa will now proceed with the appointment of a new SARS commissioner. This after the High Court in Pretoria has dismissed the case of former SARS commissioner Tom Moyane. He was seeking to get his job back and to prevent SARS Commission of Inquiry chairperson Judge Robert Nugent from submitting his final report to President Cyril Ramaphosa. Ramaphosa fired Moyane after suspending him for several months following allegations that he mismanaged SARS. In handing down the judgement, Judge Hans Fabricius described Moyane’s behaviour as abominable. “The whole of the application is an abuse of the process of this court, in my opinion the facts of the matter before me clearly show that the penaltive costs order against the applicant is justified. His behaviour throughout this proceedings is abominable. Under the above mentioned circumstances the order is therefore as follows the application is dismissed with costs including the cost of two counsel and on the attorney client scale.”
