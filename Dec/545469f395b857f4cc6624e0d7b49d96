Thunderstorms are expected across most of the country on Sunday. KwaZulu-Natal, Eastern Cape, Gauteng, Mpumalanga, Limpopo, North West, Northern Cape and Free State are forecast to experience cool and wet conditions – ranging from the mid-20s to early 30-degrees-Celcius. The Western Cape can expect warm conditions. SABC weather forecaster, Siphesihle Kunene says “We’ve got rains in KZN, Free State and most of the eastern provinces as rain is starting early in the day. In the northern parts, more rain in Gauteng and that is why we have a warning or watch for severe thunderstorms over the eastern parts. On New Year’s Day rainy weather is forecast for Johannesburg so it will be cloudy.”
