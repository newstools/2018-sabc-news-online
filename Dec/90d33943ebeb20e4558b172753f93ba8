Lobby group, Black People’s National Crisis Committee, is expected to host a picnic at Clifton’s Fourth Beach on Saturday afternoon. The latest initiative comes after the group slaughtered a sheep on the beach on Saturday as part of their ‘Reclaim Clifton’ Campaign. It is alleged that a private security company removed beach-goers from the beach last Sunday evening. The African National Congress (ANC) in the Western Cape has come out in support of the picnic. “We are in support of today’s picnic at Clifton Fourth beach. The picnic is not being organised by the ANC, but as I said, we fully support it. We are throwing our weight behind them, and we would want to ask Western Cape residents or Capetonians to join us – and want to see all of God’s beaches open to all God’s people, and make a point peacefully that we stand for non-racialism,” says Dennis Cruywagen, ANC provincial spokesperson. Meanwhile, the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Environmental Affairs says the removal of black people at Clifton Beach goes against the Constitution of the country. In a statement, the Chairperson of the Committee, Phillemon Mapulane, says they condemn this barbaric and racist act of the unlawful removal of beach-goers by a private security company. He says although the City has distanced itself from the incident, they will summon them and the PPA security company to appear before the committee as soon as Parliament resumes its business in the new year.
