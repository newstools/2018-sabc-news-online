Six suspects have been arrested in connection with the vandalism of two Vodacom shops at the Mall of the North in Polokwane on Sunday. A group of men dressed in Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) T-shirts stormed the stores after images of party leader Julius Malema and his Deputy Floyd Shivambu, captioned “Abusers of Democracy”, were shown at the Vodacom Journalist of the Year Awards. “The police in Polokwane have arrested six suspects aged between 25 and 45 for malicious damage to property after shops at Mall of the North were ransacked and damaged by a group of people. More arrests are expected,” says police Spokesperson Motlafela Mojapelo. Watch a related video below:
