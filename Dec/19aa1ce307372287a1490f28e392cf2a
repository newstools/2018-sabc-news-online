The Durban High Court is expected to rule on the case of a five year-old boy who suffers from sicle-cell anaemia. The boy needs blood transfusions and his parents who are members of the Jehova’s Witnesses are against the life saving blood donation, based on their religious conviction. Doctors say he needs regular blood transfusions to live. His parents are against it and are planning to oppose the Durban High Court interdict to give the boy the blood. Meanwhile, the Jehovah Witnesses have expressed its support of the boy’s parents.
