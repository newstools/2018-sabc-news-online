Botswana Minister of Foreign Affairs Dr Pelonomi Venson Moitoi has been sacked after she tweeted that she is running for President in 2019. The government announced in a statement that she has been dropped from cabinet and she replied “I hear I have been sacked. I am at peace with that but the race goes on.” Moitoi will take on her long time Botswana Democratic Party (BDP) ally, President Mokgweetsi Masisi, who took over when President Ian Khama stepped down in 2017. Botswana Presidential term limits are hailed as exemplary democracy, but some see the changing of the Presidency without elections as the opposite. So, President Masisi’s take over 18 months before the country’s elections was seen as an attempt to popularize him for a party that garnered 46.5% of the vote in 2014 compared the oppositions collective 53.5%. Now long time Foreign Minister Dr Venson Moitoi is breaking rank and this could further weaken support for the BDP. She contested the African Union Commission Chair seat, but lost to Moussa Faki Mahamat, and now she says her vision is more recognition for women and youth.
