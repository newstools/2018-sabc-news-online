The Gender Links for Equality and Justice has called on President Cyril Ramaphosa to ensure that government makes seeking solutions to gender-based violence its top priority in 2019. The call comes as the 16 Days of Activism Against Gender-Based Violence ends. The international campaign to challenge violence against women and girls runs every year from November 25, which is the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women, to December the tenth, which is Human Rights Day. Gender Links CEO Colleen Lowe Morna says a political will is needed to fight gender-based violence. “The President should name his priorities in 2019, which will be the 25th anniversary of our democracy and we are saying Gender Based Violence (GBV) must be right up there. It is only through leadership from the front, only through political will, that we are going to tackle the scourge. There’s a very interesting parallel in the way we have dealt with HIV/AIDS. We’re beginning to see some very real changes around HIV and AIDS.” Watch related video:
