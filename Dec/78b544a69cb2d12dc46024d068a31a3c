Parliament is racing against time to fill the eight vacant posts in the SABC board, before the public broadcaster faces a liquidity crisis situation by early in 2019. The vacancies worsened after four more board members tendered their resignations in November. At the moment, the embattled public broadcaster’s board has no quorum to make any meaningfully decisions. The board is supposed to consist of 12 non-executive directors and three executive directors. Good news is that after the nomination process closed on Friday night, a record number of candidates were nominated to serve at the board. The ball is now in parliament’s court to speed up the process. Parliament’s Communications Committee Chairperson  Hlengiwe Mkhize has thanked the public for using the opportunity to submit SABC board nominations before the deadline. Details of the nominations will only be known in a few weeks’ time when the committee meets again. Mkhize says:”The closing date was yesterday (Friday) and we will early next year meet in January and the committee will determine the quality and the number of applications and we will further communicate with the public.” At stake is to find a solution to avoid what the previous board called ground zero, when the broadcaster will be unable to pay salaries by March 2019.
