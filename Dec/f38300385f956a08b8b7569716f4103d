South Africa’s first solar-powered desalination plant is ready to start pumping water to residents of Witsand near Riversdale in the Southern Cape. The project is a collaboration between the Western Cape and French governments. Witsand is one of many small towns in the region feeling the impact of the drought. The plant will churn out 73 kilowatts of power to convert salt water to drinking water. Project manager, Patrice Boyer, says the plant will bring much needed relief to residents… “Basically it’s the very first plant in SA and extendable in Africa which is going to produce drinkable water from sea water with solar energy only. No batteries. So it’s a first in Africa and so far it will be the biggest in the world because it’s going to produce 100 kilolitre of drinkable water per day.”
