The South African National Editors Forum has lodged a complaint with the Equality Court against Julius Malema and the EFF for threatening journalists on various platforms, including social media. SANEF says that the Economic Freedom Fighters grievances against the media have not been communicated via the proper channels. They hope that the Equality Court will rule in their favour and stop the EFF and its supporters from harassing and intimidating journalists. SANEF Chairperson Mahlatse Mahlase says media freedom is under threat. “The rejection and the refusal by the EFF to distance themselves from these matters have had quite chilling effects in newsrooms.” “A lot of the junior journalists are not willing to write stories that are critical of the EFF. And this is not good for the public because the media has to give the public the full story on any political party.” You can download the links of the court papers below:
