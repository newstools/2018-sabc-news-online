With just hours left for the 24th round of climate talks to end in Katowice, Poland, some world leaders say the decision by other countries to backslide in the negotiations is nothing but immoral. Contributing to the international effort to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, a South African App ‘Biennial Update Report Explorer’ has been launched to track the country’s climate change response. “It’s an effort to track Climate Change in a country counted among the world’s polluters,” says Department of Environmental Affairs’ Samuel Mabena. But just metres away, a press conference underscored that not all is well in the negotiations so far. It is a losing battle, especially for developing countries. Out of 196 countries, four including the USA and China are disagreeing with some of the Paris Agreement goals. Civil society is not impressed either. A climate emergency is at hand and time is running out. If the alleged biggest polluters do not come to the party, it may as well take governments back to square one.
