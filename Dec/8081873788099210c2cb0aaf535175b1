South Africans who have been arrested in China will be deported to South Africa. Tristan-Lee Niemand and six other South Africans are expected to return to South Africa before Friday. They were in China to teach but officials there said they had incorrect visas and they were subsequently detained. Meanwhile, the South African mission in Shanghai has informed the Minister of International Relations, Lindiwe Sisulu that another seven South African nationals in Jiangsu province have completed their detention period. The Minister has once again appealed to South Africans planning to travel to China and other countries to ensure they have the correct visas and required travel documents. READ A STATEMENT BELOW:
