Labour union Numsa says it rejects claims that its striking plastic sector workers are behind some of the violent attacks during the strike. Since the strike started in mid-October some companies have reported incidents and posted photos on social media of assaulted and injured workers and cars vandalised and set alight. Security guard Lesley Mphahlele succumed to his injuries last Tuesday – after he was doused with petrol and set alight after a group attacked Herber Plastics company in Boksburg on Gauteng’ Eastrand. Plastic sector workers went on strike in October over increased wages. The Plastic Convertors’ Association of South Africa has called on the attackers to be prosecuted. Numsa spokesperson Phakamile Hlubi-Majola says allegations by the association that their members are behind the attacks are baseless. “Now instead of engaging us meaningfully on our demands they are flooding media houses with unfounded, unproven allegations of violence, intimidation and vandalism. Consistently they have accused Numsa of violence. Numsa is not a violent union.” “Our members know how to conduct themselves during the strike,” adds Hlubi-Majola.
