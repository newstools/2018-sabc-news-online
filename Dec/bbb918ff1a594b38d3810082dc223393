Democratic Alliance (DA) Gauteng Premier candidate Solly Msimanga has handed over a petition calling on Premier David Makhura to scrap e-tolls. Over 100 DA supporters marched to the premier’s office in the Joburg CBD. The DA also wants Makhura to use his influence in government not to renew the e-toll contract which expires at the end of this year.  Makhura has said that e-tolls are not part of Gauteng’s future plans. However, Finance Minister Tito Mboweni recently told Parliament that motorists must continue to pay for e-tolls. Msimanga says failure to do away with e-tolls will impact on the African National Congress (ANC) support during next year’s elections. “It is very disappointing that the premier’s first reaction to our march and to our submission of the petition is that we are a joke. The premier doesn’t take the people of Gauteng very serious. It actually shows with the commission of enquiry that he launched and the results that came from there that he really states the people of Gauteng are not happy with the system. The reaction that we got today that the people of Gauteng are a joke is much telling. This is the level of arrogance,” says Msimanga.  WATCH BELOW:
