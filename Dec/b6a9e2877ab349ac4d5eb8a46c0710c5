Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi says a Grade 7 learner who was filmed insulting a teacher, has a medical condition. The MEC has established an inter-departmental assessment team to help find the boy a suitable school. Lesufi visited the school, west of Johannesburg, earlier on Thursday. This is after a video depicting the learner hurling insults towards his educator surfaced and went viral. The incident happened five months ago. The School’s Governing Body had recommended for the learner to be expelled from the school. However, Lesufi says the learner will receive support from a team comprising officials from the Social Development Department, Pyscho-Social Unit, Inclusion and Special Schools. “I also had an opportunity to interview the child personally, and also to interview the parents. And out of that I felt that we immediately need to establish an independent team to investigate. He’s quite an intelligent young man, in Grade 7, going to Grade 8 next year. Therefore, we need to find a mechanism that will assist us to resolve his immediate challenges and also to attend to the medical condition that finds himself in,” says Lesufi.
