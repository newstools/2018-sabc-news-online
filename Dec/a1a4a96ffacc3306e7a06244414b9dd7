The Hawks have begun their investigation into more than R870 million in irregular, unauthorised, fruitless and wasteful spending in the Emfuleni Local Municipality in the Vaal. Emfuleni mayor Jacob Khawe admitted last month that procurement regulations were ignored. He warned that action will be taken against any implicated municipal official. The municipality has confirmed being contacted by the Hawks investigators asking for personal details of some senior municipal officials. Emfuleni mayoral spokesperson Lebo Mofokeng says: “I can confirm that currently there are no arrests that have been made. The Hawks are in the vicinity and they were granted the section, they are busy investigating and they wrote to the municipal manager last week requesting some of the departmental heads, contracts and names so that they can be able to know when they access information, who are they going to access information to. Nobody has said that anybody is guilty so far.”
