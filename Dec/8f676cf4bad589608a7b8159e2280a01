Transport Deputy Minister, Sindisiwe Chikunga, says she is concerned about the increase in road crashes during this festive season compared to last year this time. Chikunga says more than 500 lives have already been lost on the roads nationally since the start of the festive season. She was speaking during a road safety educational campaign at KwaDukuza, north of Durban.  Chikunga says her department is clamping down on crime and lawlessness on the roads. “Abide by the rules of the road; not so, we are going to enforce the law. We are not doing very well as a country this festive season. On the 14th for instance of this month, we were already above 530. At the same time last year we were around 464 and we are already above 500. This is because of the many accidents that are costing many lives at the same time.”
