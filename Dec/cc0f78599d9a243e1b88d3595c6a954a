The bail hearing of a pastor from Lindelani near KwaMashu, north of Durban, is on Tuesday expected to continue in the Ntuzuma Magistrateâ€™s Court. The man was arrested last month after the community went on the rampage, claiming that he had raped four girls aged between 15 and 19, who are members of his church. The alleged incidents date back to 2015 when the accused reportedly accommodated the girls in a house. It is alleged that the accused targeted girls from vulnerable, single-parent households. In his last appearance, his lawyer had alleged that the investigating officer has been misleading the court. The pastor has not been asked to plead yet.
