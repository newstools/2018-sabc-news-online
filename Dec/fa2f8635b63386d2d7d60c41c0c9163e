The National Assembly will on Tuesday debate the report of the Joint Constitutional Review Committee. The report which recommends how section 25 of the constitution should be amended, was adopted by the committee two weeks ago. The amendment of the constitution is an emotive issue. It was given the green light in order to give effect to land expropriation without compensation. The motion was first tabled in February and 10 months on, it’s closer to finalisation. But this was not without a failed legal challenge aiming to suspend the adoption of the committee report. The adoption of the report has also split political parties down the middle. The African National Congress (ANC), Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), United Democratic Movement (UDM) and National Freedom Party (NFP) were in support of the report, while the Democratic Alliance (DA), Freedom Front Plus, Congress of the People (COPE), Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) and African Christian Democratic Party (ACDP) were opposed to the report. Opposition have also indicated that they will challenge the process at the appropriate time. While AfriForum may have lost its urgent application to halt the National Assembly debate to be held on Tuesday, the lobby group says it still intends to make a substantive application in court and have the committee’s report set aside.
