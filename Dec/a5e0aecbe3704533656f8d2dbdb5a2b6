Political analyst, Sethularo Matebesi, says he does not believe former president Jacob Zuma, will voluntarily testify at the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture. This as damning testimonies continue to flood in at the Zondo Commission, investigating alleged state capture by the Gupta family. Zuma, his son Duduzane, and former cabinet Minister, Malusi Gigaba, are among those named by influential leaders as those who enabled state capture. Matebesi says the recent testimonies by Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan, Former Mineral Resources Minister Ngoako Ramathlodi and former SAA board chairperson Cheryl Carolus, were shocking. Matebesi says Zuma will do everything to avoid having to testify. He says, “He would definitely not come voluntarily to the Zondo Commission. That has always been the approach and the tactic of the president complaining that he has never been afforded the opportunity when he has all the opportunities and time to avail himself, but he has applied all these delaying tactics and now he is crying foul. How was it possible to be possible to be summoned by somebody like Duduzane Zuma? That for me is something that is still shocking if you look at all the testimonies that are being presented to Judge Zondo. But definitely there is a lot of evidence that implicates these three individuals.”
