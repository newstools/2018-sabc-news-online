Dodging cameras and ignoring questions. Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Meng Wanzhou was seen leaving a Canadian courtroom, after being released on bail Tuesday evening. Chinese officials say her arrest in itself was a mistake from the start. “We have already made our position clear to the United States and Canada that they should immediately correct their mistake and release Meng Wanzhou,” says Lu Kang who is the Chinese foreign ministry spokesman. That statement on Wednesday came just hours after Donald Trump spoke out on the subject as well. In an exclusive interview with Reuters the United States  President said he would intervene with the Justice Department on her case if it would serve national security interests or help close a trade deal with Beijing. Meng was detained for over a week and faces possible extradition to the US. American officials say she misled multinational banks about Iran linked transactions, putting the banks at risk of violating US sanctions. It has added yet another point of tension between Washington and Beijing, with a source telling Reuters earlier that the US is considering issuing a new warning to its citizens traveling to China about the risks of retaliation. On Tuesday Canada confirmed that one its citizens, a former Canadian diplomat, was detained there. However the Canadian government says it sees no explicit connection to the Huawei case and Beijing alleges he may have broken Chinese law.
