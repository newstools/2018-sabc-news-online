Angry residents of Extension 5 in Kestell in the eastern Free State are to celebrate their Christmas without water. This follows Maluti-A-Phofung Municipality’s failure to install a water pipeline to hundreds of households for the past 10 years. Fetching water from neighbouring townships has become a daily routine. For the past 10 years, the community has been without running water, this despite having two of the largest dams in their area. It’s alleged that money meant to install a pipeline to supply water in the area was misappropriated and residents say that they are tired of empty promises. In 2016, residents of Maluti-A-Phofung were up in arms following the Department of Water’s decision to release water from the Sterkfontein to Vaal Dam. The municipality says plans are afoot to install a pipeline to Kestell. Maluti-A-Phofung Executive Mayor Gilbert Mokotso says they have a plan. “We are going to start the pipe from QwaQwa to Kestell. A contractor has been contracted and he will start with project soon,” says Mokotso. While the residents wait for municipal promises to be fulfilled, they remain forced to depend on irregular deliveries from water trucks or risk their safety trying to get water further afield.
