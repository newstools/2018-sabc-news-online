The Mangaung Metropolitan Municipality says it plans to intensify its by-laws to minimise littering in the metro.  The municipality, with police, rolled up their sleeves in an effort to clean South Park landfill site in Bloemfontein. The Mangaung Metro municipality urged the community to keep the city clean. “For MEC Mashinini, I was deliberate to call him to be there so that he must see how urgent it is for him to approve that we must get our Metro police to enforce the laws,” says Mayor Olly Mlamleli. “The purpose is simple if you live in a healthy and clean place you live your healthy life,” says Sam Mashinini, Free State police MEC. The municipality says it is exploring processing waste into an economic commodity. Watch a related video below:
