Former Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe is back in Harare, after spending the last two months in Singapore for medical check-ups. His successor Emmerson MnangagwaÂ last week shed light about his health condition, saying the former veteran leader can no longer walk. Mnangagwa also made a commitment that his Government will continue to support him. The two seem to have made peace after relations became frosty when Mnangagwa was fired and later became instrumental in the removal of Mugabe in office. He is expected to spend the holidays at his Blue Roof home in Harare. Watch related video:
