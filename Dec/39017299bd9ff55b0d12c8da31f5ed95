The African National Cogress(ANC) says it will ensure emotional and psychological support is provided to the victim of alleged sexual harassment by the party’s National Spokesperson and NEC member, Pule Mabe. The ANC’s Internal Grievance Panel will hear the case on Wednesday after Mabe’s 26 year old assistant cited two incidents in which she says she resisted Mabe’s advances. Luthuli House officials, Zizi Kodwa and Dakota Legoete are acting as spokespersons until the matter has been resolved. Legoete says Mabe has been allowed to take leave. He says there is a panel that is being appointed to listen to this particular grievance to ensure that the rights of the victim are protected. “We have activated our HR department to ensure that they follow up on ensuring that there is enough support emotionally and psychologically to the victim and we hope as part of our grievance procedures, the matter will be concluded very quickly,” adds Legoete.
