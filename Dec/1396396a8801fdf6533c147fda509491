Traffic officials in Cape Town say they have picked up many defects on mini bus taxis wanting to leave the city for the festive season. Operation Exodus, in which vehicles are tested for road-worthiness, is under way. More than 65 vehicles will be tested at the Bellville traffic department on Friday evening. Traffic volumes out of Cape Town will peak this weekend as holiday-makers leave for various destinations for the festive season. The City’s JP Smith says commuters should ensure that they make use of vehicles that have a traffic inspection sticker. “We’ve already seen broken spreader arms, which are completely busted so if that vehicle is under any pressure, if there’s any impact on it, it will burst. Front wheels will fold immediately. We’ve already seen steering columns with massive play on it. Electrics that are not good, cracked wind-screeens and others which are perhaps less urgent, but enough defects to make you worried. “
