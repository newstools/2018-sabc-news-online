Because there are people that are using a jamming device to unlock the vehicle ,and you will find that the car has not been broken into, there’s nothing that is broken, but the goods that were inside have been stolen. So we are urging and pleading with the community that they must double check when they are using these mobilisers on their vehicles so as to prevent theft from their cars.” Watch related video below:
