Two people impersonating Home Affairs immigration officers have been arrested at the Dragon City mall in Johannesburg. The pair was wearing immigration officer’s uniform and were soliciting bribes from foreign nationals who failed to produce valid identity documents. They were caught after accepting a R20 bribe from a Chinese national who had become suspicious after failing to produce their appointment cards. Johannesburg police spokesperson Xoli Mbhele says, “Police were contacted and two suspects were apprehended and one R 1040 was recovered. The investigation is underway and the suspects are appearing today in the Johannesburg Magistrate Court.
