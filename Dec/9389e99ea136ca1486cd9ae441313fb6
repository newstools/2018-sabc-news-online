The relationship between Russia and South Africa was celebrated during the unveiling of 67 names of Soviet/Russian soldiers who died during the liberation struggle in South Africa. The Soviet soldiers fought side by side with liberation armies, not only in South Africa but also in Angola and Mozambique. The former Soviet Union also provided financial aid and military expertise and assisted with personnel training. The incorporation of the names of 67 Russian/Soviet soldiers who died during the Freedom Struggle in South Africa, is an indication that South Africa remembers and cares, according to the Ambassador of the Russian Federation Mikhail Petrakov. The 67 join more than 139 000 names on the wall, which honours the people who fought and died in the eight liberation struggles that shaped a freed South Africa. The Defence Attache of the Russian Federation to the Republic of South Africa, Vyacheslav Osipov, says by commemorating the fallen heroes, ensure they will live for ever. The Minister of Arts and Culture, Nathi Mthethwa, says Russia should be honoured for the role they played, not only in the liberation of South Africa but that of Southern Africa. Petrakov empathised that the youth is the key to ensure the names and history of the fallen heroes are remembered.
