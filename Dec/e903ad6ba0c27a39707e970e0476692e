The African National Congress (ANC) in the Eastern Cape plans to retain over 50% of its current legislature representatives. The party says it will ensure a smooth transition in governance.  The ANC is finalising its Eastern Cape representative lists ahead of next year’s elections. Provincial chair, Oscar Mabuyane, came out tops with the party’s deputy secretary, Helen Sauls-August at number two. 20% have been reserved for young people, like former provincial ANC Youth League (ANCYL) Chair, Ayanda Matiti. ANC members with scarce skills and women representation will also be prioritised. The consolidated list will now go to the ANC’s Luthuli House for finalisation. WATCH BELOW:
