At this stage, we don’t have the information, but there would be an investigation to establish where the person is, (and) who has been occupying this room. We are told that the person who occupies this room only comes and visits this room occasionally. So, we are going to have to follow up on the information we have about this person to get this person arrested as soon as possible,” explains Minnaar.
