The National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI) has launched a search after 35-year-old man and his 10-year-old son went missing at Beachview in Port Elizabeth on Saturday night. NSRI spokesperson Craig Lambinon says the duo went missing after their fishing vessel capsized. Lambinon says the man’s 16-year-old nephew who was with them managed to get to the shore and raised an alarm. In Cape Town the search is also continuing for a missing 14-year-old boy who’s presumed to have drowned at Milnerton Beach. The NSRI says the boy disappeared while swimming with friends late Saturday afternoon. Spokesperson, Lambinon, says air and shore seaches are currently being conducted. The NSRI earlier warned r beach goers to be vigilant due to the spring tide, which is bringing stronger rip-currents along the coastline. WATCH BELOW:
