Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane has directed the Financial Intelligence Centre to investigate the source of R150 000 that was paid to a travel agency that arranged a Dubai holiday trip for former Sports minister Fikile Mbalula and his family in 2016. Mbalula’s trip reportedly amounted to more than R600 000. Mkhwebane released reports of findings from a number of investigations on Wednesday in Pretoria. Mkhwebane says no action can be taken against Mbalula because he is no longer part of the executive. “I am not taking any remedial action against Mbalula since he is no longer a member of the executive and is not even a MP.” “I further direct the director of financial intelligence centre to take appropriate steps to investigate the source of R150 000 cash that was paid to Munlin Travel.” “Lastly I direct the national director of public prosecutions to also take urgent steps to investigate whether funds used to pay for Mr Mbalula’s trips were not proceeds of any crime.” Click video below:
