The bail hearing of the two men accused of murdering seven members of the Khoza family in Vlakfontein has been postponed at the Protea Magistrate’s Court in Soweto. Accused number one, Vusi Mabaso fell sick and wasn’t able to follow proceedings. This emerged during the bail application of Mabaso and Fita Khupe. Mabaso had earlier said Khupe forced him to commit the murders and the rapes. He also said Khupe wanted the family dead so he could take over the house. The remains of the family were found buried under heaps of sand inside their Vlakfontein home, south of Johannesburg. SABC’s Gillian Pillay reports from the courthouse
