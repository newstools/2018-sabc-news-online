Eastern Cape authorities say six people, believed to be relatives, died in a head-on collision on the R61 road near Mount Nicholas in Libode in the Eastern Cape. This brings to 28 the number of people who died in crashes in the province over the long weekend – and close to 100 countrywide. In the crash at Libode, it’s alleged that a car collided with a fully loaded minibus taxi. The six occupants of the car, an adult and five children, were declared dead on the scene while the 14 occupants from the taxi sustained injuries. Eastern Cape Transport spokesperson Unathi Binqose says the injured were rushed to St Barnabas hospital in Libode. “The main cause of this accident is still under investigation but indications are that speed may have been a major contributing factor… About 22 people have perished since the beginning of this weekend from Friday, and with these stats now that takes the number to 28. It’s very very disturbing. We urge our motorists to be extra vigilant and extra cautious.”
