The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) members in Tshwane have joined protests around the country against mobile network Vodacom. This is after an image of EFF leader, Julius Malema and his deputy Floyd Shivambu, with the caption “Abusers of Democracy”, was shown during the Vodacom Journalist of the Year Awards. Various Vodacom shops closed their doors for business as EFF members wearing party regalia protested at stores in Centurion, Hatfield and Eastlynne. EFF Tshwane Treasurer Obakeng Ramabodu says an attack on the party’s leadership, is an attack on the party. “We are coming back tomorrow. We’re coming back on Monday. We are coming back on Tuesday until the management of Vodacom tell us what supported their views to insult the leadership of the EFF in the manner that they insulted him. By the way the leadership of the EFF is the face of the EFF. When you insult the leadership of the EFF you are insulting the branches of the EFF no leadership of the EFF have sent us here. It’s ourselves, branches.” The image was shown as part of a keynote address delivered with by Corruption Watch chairperson Mavusa Msimang at the awards ceremony. Vodacom says in a statement Msimang’s views are his own and are not those held by Vodacom.
