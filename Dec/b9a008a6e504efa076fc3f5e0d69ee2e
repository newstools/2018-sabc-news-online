The National farmers union Agri-SA says on behalf of its members and farming communities at large it will approach the court if section 25 of the Constitution is amended. Agri-SA President Dan Kriek says following Tuesday’s decision by Parliament, where the majority of parties supported the report, they are definitely going to take the legal route to halt the pending constitutional amendment. Kriek says they view the proposed change as unnecessary as well as threatening food security and sustainable agrarian reform. Meanwhile, Deputy chair of Agri-SA Pierre Vercueil says their opposition to the constitutional changes doesn’t mean they are against land reform. Vercueil says the expropriation of land without compensation is a populist approach which has the potential of setting this country back. Related Video
