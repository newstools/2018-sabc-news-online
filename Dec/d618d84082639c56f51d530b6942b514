The family of the late Mpumalanga Community Safety spokesperson Joseph Mabuza says it’s devastated by his passing. Mabuza died after his motorbike collided with a vehicle that was making a U-turn on the N4 toll road in Hectorspruit east of Malalane on Sunday. Police have launched a manhunt for the driver of the vehicle who fled the scene of the crash. Family spokesperson Hlengiwe Dludlu says: “The support that we receiving from the honourable MEC, the safety department and all other Mpumalanga provincial government departments and the media and the local municipality give us hope and strength to go through this very difficult time. When we received the message we were all shocked. It’s difficult to believe at the end of the day we have to accept it has happened and we give everything to God.” Meanwhile, Transport Minister Blade Nzimande has lauded Mabuza for his contribution to road safety in the country. Spokesperson for the Minister, Ishmael Mnisi, “Minister Nzimande said that Mabuza was one of the seasoned communicators, a road safety ambassador and a public servant par excellence. Mabuza was not just an asset to the Mpumalanga Provincial Government. His contribution as a communicator, particularly on road safety matters did not only serve the people of Mpumalanga but the entire country.” WATCH BELOW:
