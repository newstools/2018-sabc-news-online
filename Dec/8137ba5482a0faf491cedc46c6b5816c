The State Capture Inquiry will resume its hearings in January next year. The commission will no longer be hearing evidence for the rest of this year. Among those scheduled to appear before the inquiry for cross-examination is former ANC MP Vytjie Mentor. The commission’s spokesperson Mbuyiselo Stemela says some witnesses have become unavailable to testify this year. He says the commission was scheduled to hear evidence from certain witnesses this week and early next week but there will no longer be any hearings this year. He says: “The commission will hear evidence sometime next year. You will remember there were many witnesses like former Minister Nene and Ms Vytjie Mentoor and others that we have been consulting who were suppose to be doing cross examinations.” Related Video
