Traffic authorities in Mpumalanga have again called on motorists to be cautious on roads as traffic volumes are starting to increase on the N4 toll route. A large number of vehicles are headed towards the Lebombo border post connecting the country with Mozambique. Spokesperson for Trans African Concessions, which is responsible for the N4 toll road, Solange Soares-Nicholson says they are expecting high traffic volumes. “We are expecting traffic influx especially in the Middelburg toll plaza as people will move from east towards the Lowveld and Mozambique. Of course we have been preparing for this for quite some time as early as October. We started our preparations for the festive season we have all our traffic systems on full alert we have stations in various places on the route together with some emergency services to assist with traffic management as well as to respond to emergencies and accidents that may occur during the peak traffic period.” The Mpumalanga Department of Community Safety, Security and Liaison says road crashes have decreased since the beginning of the festive season compared to same time last year. MEC, Pat Ngomane, says so far, 81 people have died on the roads. He says 96 people died during the same period last year. “This year it decreased but it is very difficult for us even if we have lost one life we will be worried. But we think we decreased and we will be working very hard with all the stakeholders to make sure that the decrease up until it becomes zero. But at the moment we are dealing with the attitude of road users.”  For more, watch video below:
