The Department of Water and Sanitation have published their lower water restrictions for urban and agricultural use in the Western Cape in the Government Gazette. Regional head, Rashid Khan says the new restrictions for domestic use have relaxed from 45% to 10% and for agricultural use from 60% to 10%. Khan says it must however be noted that these restrictions apply to bulk water. He says water availability at this time is much healthier than a year or two ago during the debilitating drought experienced in the province. The latest combined average dam levels for the Western Cape Water Supply System is just below 70%, compared to about 35% at the same time last year. Khan says the department and other water specialists will continue to monitor the situation and take appropriate steps to ensure uninterrupted water supply.
