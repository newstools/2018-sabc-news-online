Limpopo Premier, Stan Mathabatha, says the process of appointing new mayors in the province will be done in the interest of rebuilding and regenerating the African National Congress (ANC). ANC provincial spokesperson in Limpopo, Donald Selamolela says that the appointment process has already started – and they are looking at the best candidates. “We need to assure our people that the process will be conducted in such a way that we indeed provide the best we ever had… because we have learned a great lesson out of this VBS saga.” This after the Limpopo MEC resolved to fire seven of its mayors who participated in councils investing in the controversial VBS Mutual Bank. Mathabatha says criminal cases will be opened against the officials implicated in transferring millions of rands in public funds to the now liquidated bank. ANC provincial deputy chairperson and Vhembe mayor, Florence Radzilani, and Treasurer Danny Msiza are among those implicated. Radzilani had resigned before she could be fired.
