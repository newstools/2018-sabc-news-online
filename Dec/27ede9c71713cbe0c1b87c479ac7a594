The final report of the Nugent Commission of Inquiry into governance issues at the South African Revenue Service (SARS) has made wide-ranging recommendations addressing issues such as cost recovery, capacity-building, and prosecution. The report recommends that SARS takes steps to recover costs and expenses from the former Commissioner, Tom Moyane, incurred through his litigation actions. It further recommends that SARS build capacity to be able to monitor and investigate illicit trades, particularly in cigarettes. Another recommendation is that SARS take steps to restore the cordial relations that formerly existed with other state institutions including the National Prosecuting Authority, the Financial Intelligence Centre, the Auditor-General and the National Treasury. The commission has also  recommended that the National Director of Public Prosecutions institute criminal proceedings in connection with the awarding of a multi-million-rand contract to global consultancy firm Bain and Company. In the report which Nugent handed to President Cyril Ramaphosa on Thursday  he says Moyane instilled a culture of fear and intimidation in workers at SARS. Ramaphosa appointed the Commission in May 2018 following his announcement that he would take steps to restore stability to SARS. On Friday, President Cyril Ramaphosa confirmed that he has received the report and will apply his mind to its recommendations. Click below for more on the story:
