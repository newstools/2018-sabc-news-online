Google has removed a YouTube video titled ‘#MngxitamaHomecoming rally!’ which contains a speech by Black First Land First (BFL), leader Andile Mngxitama inciting black on black violence at a homecoming rally in Tlokwe, Ikageng, on December 8 in response to an interview of Johann Rupert. BFL accuses Johann Rupert of displaying racism during a Power FM interview which in turn is captured on YouTube in two parts namely: Power FM hosts Johann Rupert and Power FM hosts Johann Rupert, Part 2. In the video footage Rupert says that he has his own army and that the taxi associations are his business partners and therefore his private militia. He further stats that anyone who affects his interests will be subjected to taxi owner’s violence. BFL has argued that Google has taken away their freedom of expression and that the ban should be removed on the video. This after Mngxitama threatened to kill five white people for every one person who dies in taxi violence. This week, the Ahmed Kathrada Foundation says the violent anti-white rhetoric expressed by Mngxitama is “inciteful and amounts to hate speech”. Executive Director, Neeshan Balton, says Mngxitama’s assertions served to simply stoke up the anger of people, and can potentially unleash violence against white South Africans. Balton says Mngxitama’s true motives should be questioned, when instead of deliberating on real issues affecting South Africans, he instead uses public platforms to talk about going the rampage and killing whites and their children.
