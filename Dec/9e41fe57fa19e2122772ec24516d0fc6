The African National Congress (ANC) says it will help its former president, Jacob Zuma, to pay millions of rands in legal fees. On Thursday the High Court in Pretoria ruled that Zuma has to personally pay his legal fees in criminal matters. The court upheld an application by the Democratic Alliance (DA) and Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) to set aside the 2006 agreement authorising state funding for Zuma’s defence in criminal cases. Speaking on Morning Live, the ANC’s Acting national spokesperson Dakota Legote says they will donate money to help the former President. “We are owning up to this particular matter. Members of the ANC will either through donations and other forms assist the former president both as the leader of the ANC and the former state president of the republic. I don’t forsee any problem.” Watch interview below:
