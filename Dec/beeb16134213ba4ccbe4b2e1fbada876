Mzwanele Nyhontso is the new leader of the Pan Africanist Congress. Nyhontso was elected during the party’s three day national conference in Kimberley in the Northern Cape. The party has been marred by infighting and leadership squabbles with Narius Moloto, Letlapa Mphahlele and Luthando Mbinda claiming to be leaders of the party. They all approached the courts in a bid to stop each other from claiming the party presidency. The PAC faction led by Kenneth Mokgatlhe is the one hosting the elective conference in Kimberley. Meanwhile, Moloto who has boycotted the conference has described it as unconstitutional. He says he remains the leader of the party and has already opened a fraud case against the organisers of the elective conference. “It’s not an individual that goes to the conference, but the delegates which are coming from the branches. How can they then say they invite me as an individual? That thing, so far as the PAC is concerned, is null and void. We’ve already opened a fraud case for their usage of the forged letter heads of the PAC and the name and the logos of the PAC. They do not have an authority nor right to do so,” says Moloto. The PAC faction led by Narius Moloto has called on all South Africans to observe Reconciliation Day and advance the lives of the many citizens who are living below the poverty line.
