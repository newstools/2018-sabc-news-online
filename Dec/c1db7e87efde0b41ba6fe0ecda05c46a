US President Donald Trump has offered praise for his late predecessor George H.W. Bush who passed away yesterday at the age of 94. The 45th President of the United States said he and first lady Melania join a grieving nation to mourn the loss of the 41st president. Trump says Bush inspired a generation of Americans to public service while always finding a way to set the bar higher. Trump who has had a difficult relationship with the entire Bush family, offered only praise for the late president and is expected to later offer his condolences in a call with former President George W. Bush, the son of the late President. The Bush family also buried their matriarch Barbara Bush who passed away just 8 months before her husband. Trump is expected to attend the state funeral of the late President in Washington with next Wednesday expected to be designated a National Day of Mourning. Former President Barack Obama called the late Bush a patriot and humble servant while former President Bill Clinton gave thanks for his long life of service and friendship. Trump has meanwhile canceled a press conference planned for Saturday at the G20 summit, saying he wanted to show respect to the family of late president George H.W. Bush. “Out of respect for the Bush Family and former President George H.W. Bush we will wait until after the funeral to have a press conference,” Trump tweeted. Bush, the 41st president, died Friday at 94. – Additional Reporting Reuters
