Home Affairs Minister Siyabonga Cwele has interacted with travelers at the Beit Bridge border post between Zimbabwe and South Africa. Cwele says he is satisfied with the level of work done by employees of different sections at the border post. He, however, says the infrastructure needs to be improved. “The flows are moving well because they have created this other temporary structures to remove the load from the main building. I think it is working well… Quite clearly, we need to improve the infrastructure in long term so it becomes seamless – and we need to look at also increasing the personnel and improving our technologies like we said in the morning. But the flows with the increases that we have it is moving quite well I have not heard anyone complaining.”
