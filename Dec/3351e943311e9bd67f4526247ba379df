President Cyril Ramaphosa has described the late Mendi Msimang as one who carried out his duties in a scrupulous manner. Msimang passed away this week at the age of 89. He was a former High Commissioner in London in the 1990’s and ANC treasurer-general up to 2007. Ramaphosa delivered the eulogy at the special official funeral service in Lynnwood, Pretoria East. “Uncle Mendi served as the ANC treasurer-general – a position more difficult and hazardous than any other in the movement. In that time, he was scrupulous in his determination that not one cent should go missing, that no resources meant for the transformational programme of the organisation should be misappropriated or wasted. I used to think that Madiba was simply the best fund raiser the ANC had ever produced, until I saw Comrade Mendi at work.” African National Congress Treasurer General Dr Zweli Mkhize says Msimang left the ANC with the treasure of his wisdom about the history of the struggle. Mkhize has commended the former Treasurer general of the ruling party and former high commissioner to the UK for his knowledge on social issues in general. He described Msimang’s departure as the real end of an era of the calibre of leaders that brought South Africans freedom and democracy.
