Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs Minister Zweli Mkhize says all three spheres of government should work together to ensure service delivery to the people. Mkhize was talking during his ministerial Imbizo held at Phillipi in Cape Town on Friday.  People who came from various townships used the opportunity to ask for houses, jobs and an end to crime. “We are discussing this issue of finding land within city centres so that we can locate a number of our people. The whole program is supposed to help re-plan urban centres…” Other residents raised concerns about a lack of education among young people, saying they end up getting involved in criminal activities. “We have a very big issue. Please minister help us when it comes to education we say we have freedom this is not a freedom we need education,” says one resident.
