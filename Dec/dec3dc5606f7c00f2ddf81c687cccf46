The MEC for Safety and Security in KwaZulu-Natal, Mxolisi Kaunda says that the province has the highest number of murders in South Africa. Kaunda was speaking at the Annual Provincial Crime Summit in Durban on Tuesday, where delegates took stock of the initiatives of the past year. Kaunda says there’s a need to return to strong family values if the country is to win the fight against crime. “That radical action should be informed by the change of mind-sets of our people. We can’t accept to live with crime as if it should form as part of our daily basis activities. We need to build positive societal attitudes and values and enhancing community participation. Once we are able to win that battle of stabilising families as a province, we have decided to establish a social cohesion and moral regeneration council.” Listen to interview below for more: <a href="https://iono.fm/e/633308">Content hosted by iono.fm</a>
