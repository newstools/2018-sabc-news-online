The Economic Freedom Fighter (EFF) in the North West says the removal of former Premier Supra Mahumapelo earlier in 2018, was influenced by party internal squabbles in the province. The party also says since Mahumapelo’s removal, there has not been any improvement in service delivery. EFF member of the provincial legislature, Betty Diale says, “We are disappointed that since the removal of Supra from premiership in the North West, not much is being done. The removal of Supra was necessary, but we expected those who would come in to do work for the people of the North West. There’s no service delivery. There’s nothing at all.” However, Premier Job Mokgoro says there’s some stability within the province. “There is relative stability, but truth of the matter is there are sporadic outbursts of dissatisfaction. So, on the whole have we seen significant movement forward? I think we have to see better. But, have we felt some sense of stabilisation? I think we have,” says Mokgoro. Watch related video below:
