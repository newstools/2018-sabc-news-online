Scores of people displaced by Thursday night’s fire in Alexandra township north of Johannesburg have been taken to places of safety overnight. The cause of the fire in Alexandra is not yet known. An estimated 150 shacks were burnt down. The fire has now been contained and its cause is being investigated. Humanitarian organisation Gift of the Givers says it has moved a mother who gave birth and another with four children to their Logistics Centre in Bramley. Johannesburg Emergency Services spokesperson Nana Radebe says, “At the moment we cannot say exactly how many families.  Disaster management is busy with that and later today. We will have how many people have been displaced. And also yesterday other people had started rebuilding.” Watch related video:
