The families of the Life Esidimeni victims say they will still continue to push for a criminal case against former Gauteng Health MEC, Qedani Mahlangu. Mahlangu and another former Health MEC, Brian Hlongwa were removed from the Provincial Executive Committee (PEC) on Tuesday. Earlier in 2018, their appointment to the powerful ANC body was met with outrage in different quarters, most notably from the families still reeling from the Esidimeni deaths. Although the families have welcomed the decision to remove Mahlangu from the PEC, their spokesperson Christine Nxumalo has warned it’s not the end of the road for them. “Remember, she is being asked to do something. It’s not as if she is the one saying, ‘look guys, I’ve brought about harm or my decisions have brought about harm, so I will resign.’ It is a body requesting her to resign. So, forgiveness cannot be part of this process. For us basically, what we are saying is we are going to go ahead; we are going to appeal to the NPA to push ahead and bring about criminal charges,” says Nxumalo. Watch related video below:
