Axed SARS Commissioner Tom Moyane will know his fate on Tuesday. This as Judge Hans Fabricious is expected to hand down his judgment. Moyane wants to be reinstated. Moyane approached the High Court to have his dismissal lifted and prevent the release of the final Nugent Commission report. His court application is also a bid to interdict the appointment of a new SARS head. Moyaneâ€™s legal counsel argued that he be reinstated while an acting commissioner heads the Revenue Service. This after President Cyril Ramaphosa fired him based on recommendations made in the Nugent Interim Report. But Moyane is adamant his dismissal is unlawful. WATCH RELATED VIDEO BELOW:
