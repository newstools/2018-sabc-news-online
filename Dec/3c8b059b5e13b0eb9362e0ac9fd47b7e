The Service has warned of flash flooding in parts of Gauteng as residents of Sebokeng  are cleaning up after the flood. The Emfuleni Municipality is assessing the extent of the damage as the rain persists. Forecaster Dipuo Tawana explains, “Gauteng and North West, Mpumalanga and the western bushveld of Limpopo, the western and north-eastern parts of KwaZulu-Natal – we do expect this rain to persist on and off – throughout this evening into tomorrow. Even though we’re not expecting torrential or heavy rainfall, but because the soil is saturated, we’re expecting most of the water that would be coming from the sky to run off, thus resulting in flooding in most areas.”
