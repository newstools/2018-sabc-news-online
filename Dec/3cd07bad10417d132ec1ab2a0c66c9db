Seventeen forensic pathology service workers have been arrested. Spokesperson for the Department of Health Ncumisa Mafunda confirmed that the 17 were arrested at Fort Napier Medico-Legal Mortuary on Monday afternoon. MEC of Health in KwaZulu Natal Dr Sibongiseni Dlomo explains that the workers have failed to adhere with the agreements in regard to the Labour Relations Act without declaring a strike. “We found workers who would wake up and do a go slow. What is a go slow? A worker would normally in a day assist in performance of about eight post mortems will wake up and say today I’m only going to do two… and workers who were already working the previous day all of them next shift report to be sick.”
