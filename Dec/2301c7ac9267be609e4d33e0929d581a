Gauteng police say the deployment of the police’s Tactical Response Team (TRT) in Sophiatown has contributed to the decrease in violent crimes in the Johannesburg suburb. Over 30 suspects have been arrested for various crimes including drugs possession, armed robbery, and assault and driving under the influence of alcohol. Police Minister Bheki Cele visited the area in October after residents complained about violent crimes including gang violence and drug trafficking. Gauteng police spokesperson Kay Makhubele says the suspects will appear in court soon. “This happened because of the Integrated Task team which consist of the Tactical Response Team, the K9 and the Detectives who are deployed in the area. So, we will be making sure that during this time the roadblocks are conducted, the shebeens are raided, and also we’ll make sure that those that are driving under the influence of liquor in and around the area are arrested.” Click on video below:
