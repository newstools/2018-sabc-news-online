Parliament will have its final plenary sessions of the year this week as members go to do constituency work and have a Christmas break. The highlights of the week will include the debate on the report of the Constitutional Review Committee by both houses. Deputy President David Mabuza is also scheduled to appear before the National Assembly to reply to oral questions. There will also be 26 committee meetings. The National Council of Provinces (NCOP) will rise on Tuesday while the National Assembly holds its last meeting on Thursday. But before then, the National Assembly plenary will consider five bills and four reports from portfolio committees. The five pieces of legislation include the Foreign Service Bill, Property Practitioners Bill and the Road Accident Benefit Scheme Bill. The NCOP on the other hand will consider 11 bills, which include among others the National Research Foundation bill, the Communal Property Associations Amendment Bill and the Competition Amendment Bill. On Thursday, the Deputy President will face questions from members of the National Assembly that include those related to the anti-poverty and short-term job creation strategy, the failures in the governance of the country’s public health care system as well as attacks on businesses owned by foreign nationals.
