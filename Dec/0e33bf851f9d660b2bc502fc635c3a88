Western Cape Democratic Alliance (DA)  leader, Bonginkosi Madikizela, says he is not surprised that former Member of Parliament  Lennit Max has joined the African National Congress (ANC). Max was a former Western Cape Commissioner of Police and a Democratic Alliance (DA) member of Parliament. He was appointed as special advisor to Police Minister Bheki Cele about six months ago fuelling speculation he was moving closer to the ANC. Madikizela says it was clear Max had found a new political home. “Lennit hasn’t been a member of the DA since he became the advisor to the Minister of Police Bheki Cele.  It was always part of the deal for him to join the ANC at some stage, and I’m happy that he’s decided to make his new political home official finally.” Click below for a related video:
