The 58 year-old scholar patrol guard who was accused of raping and sexual assaulting learners at the A.B Xuma Primary school in Soweto, has been found not guilty by the Johannesburg High Court sitting at the Palm Ridge Magistrates court in Ekhuruleni. Johannes Molefe, who worked at the school as a patrol guard, was arrested in October last year after several learners told teachers that had he raped and sexually assaulted them. Johannes Molefe is a free man once again after spending more than a year behind bars. Judge Peet Johnson has acquitted Molefe on all three charges of rape and all eleven charges of sexual assault. In his ruling, Judge Peet Johnson said that the learners where coached into making the allegations against by Molefe by social workers at the Teddy Bear clinic, as well as one of the court prospectors who interviewed the learners at the clinic. He went on to tell the court that the learners witness statements and testimonies also had several discrepancies. Judge Johnson then lashed out at the prosecution team saying that it’s their duty to assist the court in coming to a just conclusion and it is not their duty to solicit dancing evidence from witnesses to secure a conviction. Parents express disappointment Parents of learners at the A.B Xuma Primary school in Soweto have expressed their disappointment after the man was acquitted on all charges. Phindile Sinye who speaks on behalf of the parents say they want to appeal the judgement. She says they believe the court only focused on the mistakes made in the process, and not on the alleged crimes committed against the children. “The parents are devastated by the court’s decision. Even during the case there were a lot of discrepancies done by the police. Police were very negligent in handling the case. We even raised this with the SAPS to say there were many discrepancies. We’re not surprised by the verdict is because of the negligence of the police.” Watch related video below:
