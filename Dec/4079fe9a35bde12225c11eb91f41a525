The High Court in Durban has extended the order it granted the KwaZulu-Natal Health Department to continue administering the blood transfusion to a five-year-old boy. This comes after parents of the critically ill boy refused the blood transfusion administration based on their religious beliefs. The boy suffers from sickle cell anaemia. The court has postponed the matter to February the 26 2019 to allow the parents to make their opposing submissions for alternative medical treatment. The court says the childâ€™s right to life supersedes any existing beliefs and laws.
