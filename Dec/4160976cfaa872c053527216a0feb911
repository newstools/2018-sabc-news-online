The building of a multi-million rand controversial taxi rank at Setsing in Qwaqwa in the eastern Free State is yet to get off the ground. Taxi associations and passengers have already expressed dissatisfaction saying they are not going to use the facility because it’s not appropriate to be used as a taxi rank. Owners and operators say the rank is too small, while commuters say it’s going to be too far from business. Qwaqwa Taxi Association spokesperson, Tubatsi Moloi says they’ll refuse to utilise the rank when it’s complete. “That rank taxi is little bit far from the central business because our customers are going to take a long journey to the rank and it is not yet finished at the moment. But we see we can’t go there,” says Moloi. Moloi has accused the municipality of failing to consult them when planning to build the rank. Authorities are confident that the rank will be operational in two years’ time. Maluti-a-Phofung executive mayor, Gilbert Mokotso elaborates: “I am busy with the consultants and developers they are going to come against before the end of this year so that we prepare a mall to be built.” The rank has been mired in controversy since the planning phase. There was also a dispute about who is the rightful owner of the land. WATCH BELOW:
