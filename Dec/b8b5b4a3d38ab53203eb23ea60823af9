The Cannabis Expo in Pretoria has extinguished after four days and had a record attendance during the event. Organisers say it attracted large numbers despite having no spliffs or plumes of billowing smoke. It was the first cannabis expo in the country with items on sale and on exhibit. They ranged from hemp-made products to medicinal ones. Founders claim the industry’s undoubtedly becoming big business. “We knew that South Africans were a nation of cannabis lovers but we didn’t realize just how successful this would be. We’re very, very happy with the attendance, the exhibitors are certainly happy with the attendance and every visitor who walks through the door you can see they’re smiling they’re learning, they’re getting into cannabis and finding out what it’s all about,” says Silas Howarth, expo co-founder. In September, the Constitutional Court ruled that the personal use of dagga is not a criminal offence but the law still prohibits its trade or distribution. Nonetheless, many hope the pending legal changes will allow them to take their businesses out of the closets. The expo moves to Cape Town and Durban in April and June next year. Watch video below:
