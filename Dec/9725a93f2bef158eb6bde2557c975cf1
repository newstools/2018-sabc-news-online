Police have raided the notorious G hostel in Welkom in the Free State. The hostel is frequented by so-call Zama Zama’s in the gold-mining area. The raid on Saturday morning was carried out after community members complained to Police Minister Bheki Cele about criminal activities. Cele, who is attending crime prevention operations in the Welkom area, says he is happy with the raid, although no arrests were made. He says: “We are here because this area which happens to fall within Thabong/Welkom is one area that is troublesome for the South African police. When you look at the statistics, it is worse than Mangaung and other areas.” “One thing that keeps coming up is that there are groups that are moving around which rob and shoot people. We have the names of these groups and we have asked the police in the area to look at those groups and make sure that they are not allowed to harass our people.”
