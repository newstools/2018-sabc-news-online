The Democratic Alliance (DA)  has vowed to become the voice of ordinary citizens on illegal immigration. The party says it would be irresponsible of it or any other party not to speak on the issue as it affects ordinary South Africans. Mmusi Maimane was speaking at a media briefing on the party’s 2018 Government Review. He’s denied suggestions that the DA has resorted to a xenophobic stance in an attempt to boost its electoral chances. “You don’t become xenophobic by speaking about an issue that affects citizens. You actually allow xenophobia to occur by being silent to a question that citizens are putting forward. Because failure of parties such as the DA to not communicate about it delivers Brexit, delivers Trump.” WATCH RELATED VIDEO:
