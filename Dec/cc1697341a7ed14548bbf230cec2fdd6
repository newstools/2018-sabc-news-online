South Africa’s Ambassador to Rwanda has been called home and Rwanda’s Ambassador to South Africa has been summoned, after the Minister of International Relations Lindiwe Sisulu was insulted by Rwanda’s Deputy Foreign Minister. He called Sisulu by a derogatory name in a tweet because she had met former Rwanda army commander, General Faustin Kayumba Nyamwasa, who lives in exile in South Africa. Minister Sisulu was trying to normalise relations with Rwanda after a diplomatic spat following attacks on Nyamwasa’s home in Johannesburg and the killing of Rwanda’s former intelligence chief in Sandton. “One of the tweets that we did not like was posted by the Deputy Foreign Minister and we have seen it appearing in a number of other publications, the articles that come from those posts are concerning and the language is undiplomatic. We have been talking to Kigali. We are seeing a movement towards the direction that we want, which is to stop the insults and the social media postings. We have noted as well that the Deputy Foreign Minister has not posted anything else. We have also noted the comment of the Foreign Minister to say he looks forward to the meeting with the Minister so there is some progress that is taking place. This does not affect the good relations that have developed between our president and their president,” says Ndivhuwo Mabaya, International Relations Spokesperson.
