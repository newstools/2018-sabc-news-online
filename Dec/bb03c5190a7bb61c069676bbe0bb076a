The African National Congress (ANC) has started the process of replacing the seven mayors dismissed on Tuesday after the VBS scandal. ANC provincial spokesperson Donald Selamolela says on Thursday the Tubatse-Fetakgomo local municipality elected an acting mayor. Vhembe district, Makhado and Collins Chabane local municipalities will hold special council sittings on Friday to replace their mayors. Selamolela says the ANC doesn’t want a vacuum in leadership: “We are looking to ensure that by Tuesday we have appointed acting mayors in all seven municipalities.” Meanwhile, provincial party Treasurer Danny Msiza has since stepped aside while Radzilani has only resigned as the Executive Mayor of Vhembe. Selamolela says the ANC in the province understands Radzilani is communicating with Luthuli House over her position. Watch related video below:
