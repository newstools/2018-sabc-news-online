The South African Airways (SAA) expects to increase sales on its platform in its new partnership with Emirates, the world’s largest international airline. In terms of the deal that has just been signed, SAA will access more destinations without launching additional routes. SAA says the arrangement will also give Emirates access to its platforms and destinations. SAA spokesperson, Tlali Tlali, says the deal will help the embattled national flag carrier improve its financial position. “We should be able to sell more in so far as our passengers are concerned for them to access where SAA’s own direct metal does not operate. In other words, SAA doesn’t have a direct service from Jo’burg to Dubai and to the points beyond, but this particular agreement will enable us to sell to points to Dubai initially and beyond.” WATCH RELATED VIDEO BELOW:
