A motorist faces charges of reckless and drunk driving after an unidentified family of three were killed in a head-on collision Friday night on the N2 near Heidelberg in the Southern Cape. Western Cape Traffic Chief Kenny Africa says the man and his wife succumbed to injuries on the scene while their little boy died shortly afterwards in hospital. Africa says there was high drama on the scene after a highly intoxicated driver sped through emergency and rescue workers. The speedster was caught and eventually arrested after a wild scuffle with traffic officials and police. He is expected to appear in court on charges of reckless and negligent driving as well as driving under the influence of alcohol.
