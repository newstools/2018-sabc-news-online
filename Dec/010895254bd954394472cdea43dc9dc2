The trial of Nigerian pastor, Timothy Omotoso, and co-accused Lusanda Sulani and Zukiswa Sitho, has been postponed to February 4, next year in the High Court in Port Elizabeth, on Monday. The trial was also postponed earlier to allow defense attorney, Peter Daubermann to petition the Supreme Court of Appeal. Daubermann wants Judge Mandela Makaula to recuse himself from the case and the charges against his clients quashed. Judge Makaula dismissed Daubermannâ€™s application in the high court but granted him leave to appeal. Omotoso was supposed to learn today whether the Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA) had made an order to grant his application for the judge to recuse himself. Omotoso and the two co-accused are facing a total of 97 charges, ranging from sexual assault, rape and trafficking for sexual purposes to racketeering.  WATCH ASSOCIATED VIDEO:
