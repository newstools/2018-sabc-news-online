President Cyril Ramaphosa says South Africa is committed to the multilateral system to resolve global problems. He was speaking at a ceremony to receive ambassadors from different countries. He also pitched the country’s message that it’s open for business. The letters of credence were from Kuwait, the Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, Peru, Sri Lanka and Norway. Receiving newly appointed representatives to South Africa, this was an opportunity for the President to relay the country’s message to the world about strong commitment to working with different nations. But foremost on the President’s mind, was to remind all and sundry that the country is regaining lost ground that has been beset by slow economic growth over the years. “Many of these countries have strong relations with South Africa. They have vowed to work closely with the continent’s most industrialised country to improve the lives of the people.” Click video below:
