Five suspects in a case where two women were allegedly burnt to death for practising witchcraft, will appear at Mount Ayliff Magistrates’ Court at EmaXesibeni in the Eastern Cape on Tuesday. They face charges of murder and arson. Police spokesperson Khaya Tonjeni says a total of seven suspects, including two minors, were arrested after the two women were attacked at Ngonyameni village last Wednesday. Their houses were later torched. Tonjeni says the motive for the murder is not known at this stage. “The two minors are going to be taken to social workers who will make a recommendation on which steps to be taken. Major General Swart also commended the speedy arrest and dedication displayed by the team of detectives.  She said the matter has been elevated to the province because of its seriousness – and efforts will be engaged to educate the public against the attack of our weak and vulnerable. We will also engage other government departments so that awareness can be made by all other stakeholders,” says Tonjeni.
