The number of road fatalities so far during this festive season is already around the 800 mark nationwide. There have been several fatal crashes, some with multiple deaths, since the announcement of a provisional toll of 767 from the 1st of December to the 17th. Transport authorities are pulling out all the stops to stem the tide of road crashes and officials are out on the roads conducting safety campaign and road blocks. Deputy Transport Minister, Sindisiwe Chikunga is part of a roadblock currently being conducted at Senwabarwana also called Bochum in Limpopo. She says the provisional figure up to the 17th was already up by almost 100 on the previous year. She says nationwide the numbers are not looking good. She says: “Only one province recorded a decrease which is Gauteng. All other provinces have registered an increase in fatalities and even crashes.” “We are so concerned as we approach the Christmas long weekend. We also have a long weekend for the new year and we are already at this figure. This is alarming,” says Chikunga.
