The National Police Commissioner, General Khehla Sitole, says he has confidence in the training provided to police officers. He was speaking at the graduation ceremony of more than 3500 police officers. Police trainees from Gauteng, Limpopo, North West, Mpumalanga and KwaZulu-Natal are on parade after having successfully completing their training. Speaking at the Passing Out Parade at the South African Police Service (SAPS) Academy in Tshwane, Sitole urged the officers to use the legal framework provided to them when confronting criminals. “We go through the training and development research. We come up with new forms of training. As we are moving forward with the training, we will be improving the tactical awareness and resilience of our police. I want to say, if any of you are against a criminal, someone will fall and it is not going to be you because we have trained you and given you the best training we can. Apply the law that you’ve been taught, but don’t die with your guns.” Click on videos below:
