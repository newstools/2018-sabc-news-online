Anglican Archbishop of Cape Town Thabo Makgoba says he’s worried about politically-motivated killings in the country. In KwaZulu-Natal Premier Willies Mchunu established the Moerane Commission nearly two years ago to investigate political killings in the province. The commission’s finalised report pointed to several government failures, provincial politics and ultimately, material greed as the reasons for the killings. Makgoba was delivering a sermon during the annual midnight mass at the St George’s Cathedral in Cape Town… “At the same time as as highly contested elections loom next year, we are seeing a spike in threats of violence as well as the ongoing killings of political opponents in some parts of the country. Of course we welcome the changes in government since last Christmas when I called from this pulpit for the replacement of the then President. We welcomes those steps taken to clean up government and to root out corruption in the public and private sector. But how far will good clean government take us when people are killed on the picket lines, stabbed in our schools, beaten up in service delivery protests and assassinated in disputes over who will hold public office. Regrettably we are a nations believing that outcomes are achieved only through violence.”
