Egypt unveiled a well preserved 4400 year old tomb decorated with hieroglyphs and statues south of Cairo on Saturday and officials expect more discoveries when archaeologists excavate the site further in coming months. The tomb was found in a buried ridge at the ancient necropolis of Saqqara which is situated within the Giza province. It was untouched and unlooted, Mostafa Waziri secretary general of the Supreme Council of Antiquities, told reporters at the site. He described the finds as “one of a kind in the last decades”. The tomb dates from the rule of Neferirkare Kakai, the third king of the Fifth Dynasty of the Old Kingdom. “Archaeologists removed a last layer of debris from the tomb on Thursday and found five shafts inside,” says Waziri. One of the shafts was unsealed with nothing inside but the other four were sealed. “They are expecting to make discoveries when they excavate those shafts starting on Sunday,” says Wazir. The tomb lies in a buried ridge that has only partially been uncovered. Waziri says he expects more discoveries to be made there when archaeologists start more excavation work in January.
