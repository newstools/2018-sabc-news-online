Fourteen councillors of the Maluti A Phofung Municipality at QwaQwa in the eastern Free State, including the mayor, have been fired by the ANC National disciplinary committee. They appealed to National Disciplinary Committee (NDC)  against the outcome of the Provincial Executive Committee to suspend them. They were accused of contravening the party’s constitution by voting with the opposition to elect Gilbert Mokotso as the new mayor during a council meeting in June 2018. “This is a demonstration that the ANC means business when it comes to unity, and of course a discipline on its members. We were fully aware that we will go to by-elections should the decision of the province be upheld, but we said let’s take this decision because we must demonstrate to those who elected us. That will not be soft on the members of the ANC who are defying ANC and the mandate of the ANC, that came by the masses of our people,” says Free State ANC spokesperson, Thabo Meeko.
