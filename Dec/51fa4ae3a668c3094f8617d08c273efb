Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) leader iNkosi Mangosuthu Buthelezi says it is deeply worrying that South Africa remains one of the most dangerous countries for women. He was speaking at the party’s Gender Based Violence conference. The veteran leader also added his voice against the stigma attached to people affected and infected with HIV/AIDS. Buthelezi was one of the first leaders to publicly reveal that two of his children died as a result of AIDS. Related to instances of abuse, he has urged parents to act swiftly to protect their children, when suspecting incidents of abuse. “Too often people fear getting involved when they suspect that something is happening , that their child is being abused or a women is being hit. But they don’t want to act without concrete evidence. They don’t want to be the ones that go to the police especially if the victim is someone in their own family. They fear a backlash of disbelief and of arguments and hatred.”
