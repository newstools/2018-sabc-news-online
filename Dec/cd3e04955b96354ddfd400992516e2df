The Freedom Front Plus says it will join any organisation including AfriForum as friends of the court in their challenge against the Constitutional Review Committee report on land expropriation without compensation. Various organisations including political parties such as the Congress of the People and the Democratic Alliance have threatened to approach the court to set the report aside. The report recommended that Section 25 of the Constitution be amended to allow land expropriation without compensation. AfriForum has already filed its second part of its court application for a full judicial review of the committee proceedings. “For instance, you are referring to AfriForum. I am on record that I said that we will support them if they can follow certain procedures to see if they can stop the process; then we will support them. Whether they are going to be successful or not, we will support any institution that will follow those processes. And there are many. For instance even Agri-South Africa said they will go to the Constitutional Court. I mean the Institute for Race Relations said they will go to the court and therefore we say that yes we will join hands in the whole legal process to stop expropriation without compensation,” says Freedom Front Plus leader Pieter Groenewald. Meanwhile Black First Land First leader, Andile Mngxitama has confirmed that the BLF will join Parliament in challenging Afriforum and the parties that will approach the court. “Black First Land First have indeed applied to be a friends of the court in the desperate attempt by AfriForum and others like them to try to stop the process of amending the Constitution. Of course we know that it is really a political game by both the ruling party and EFF to say they are going to amend the Constitution and giving unnecessary ammunition to racist organisations such as AfriForum. We are going to reject AfriForum.”
