Western Cape Traffic officials and Emergency Services had their hands full overnight when a little girl made her unexpected arrival as her mother went into labour while in a taxi. Provincial Traffic Chief Kenny Africa says shortly after midnight a taxi driver stopped at the Fatique Management roadblock between Beaufort West and Laingsburg, asking for help as a passenger was in labour. Emergency Medical Services assisted and a baby girl was born in the ambulance. Africa says they had a busy evening as many motorists made use of the fatigue management roadblocks to pull off and rest.
