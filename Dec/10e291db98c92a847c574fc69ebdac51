Prophet Sheperd Bushiri’s church is calling on its members to come forward if they are missing family or friends to help identify the three women who died during a stampede at the church in Pretoria on Friday night. The church says the stampede occurred when congregants pushed to find shelter during heavy downpours. The Enlightened Christian Gathering Church‘s legal representative, Terence Baloyi, says the bodies have not been identified. They were taken to private mortuaries by church members on Friday night. Between 40 and 60 000 people, from several countries, attend the church services. Baloyi says the nine people that were injured will receive assistance from the church. “Now the plan is we’re busy as pastors and the church leadership as to find out who are their relatives, because of as of yesterday (Saturday) we could not establish who are the relatives, as the bodies were not identified as yet. So we are still appealing to the pastors and our members to come forward to help us identify the bodies before we can come with the next action as to how to assist them forward, as to transport or whatever they need. I believe we are now ready to do whatever it takes.” Watch video below:
