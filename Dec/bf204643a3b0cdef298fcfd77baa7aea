Sentencing procedures in the trial of former property mogul, Jason Rohde are on Wednesday set to resume in the High Court in Cape Town. Rohde was convicted last month after murdering his wife at the Spier Wine Estate near Stellenbosch in 2016. The defence told the court that it needs more time to consult with Rohde’s daughters who will be witnesses in mitigation of sentence. Defence advocate, Abraham van der Spuy argued that he needs more time to consult with experts like a psychologist and Rohde’s friend who has agreed to testify about his good character. Rohde’s bail of R1 million has been revoked. Related Video
