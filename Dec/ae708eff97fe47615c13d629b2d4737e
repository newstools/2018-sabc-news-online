Presidential spokesperson Khusela Diko says President Cyril Ramaphosa is still applying his mind on the legal advice he received about the Protection of State Information Bill. The Controversial Bill, which was passed by the National Assembly in 2013, is yet to be signed into law. It was heavily criticised by the opposition parties, civil society and media organisation as the biggest threat to press freedom and freedom of expression since the dawn of democracy. Diko says the President wants to make sure that once signed the bill will pass the Constitutional muster. Diko says the President will soon give direction on the matter. “President Ramaphosa has now sought an independent legal opinion also consulting state security and other relevant state departments his key issue is around constitutionality of the relevant clauses he is still applying his mind on the opinion given to him and will be giving direction soon on how he wishes to proceed.”
