Gauteng Premier David Makhura has arrived in Alexandra, north of Johannesburg, following a fire that swept through hundreds of informal settlements.  It’s alleged that a man started the fire after having a fight with his girlfriend. He was allegedly attacked by community members – and later died in hospital after succumbing to his injuries. Police are appealing for anyone with information to come forward. Non-Profit Organisations are appealing for donations to help the displaced families. Makhura addressed the community members, “We are here to help you. We must work with you to rebuild immediately. Our councilors from different parties will be working together. The City of Jo’burg, emergency teams and South Africans who are good Samaritans are responding very well. We must all rebuild as soon as possible and you will be back where you were staying.” WATCH RELATED VIDEO:
