A group of family members whose loved ones were part of the Life Esidimeni tragedy are demanding compensation from the Gauteng Premier’s Office. In 2015, the Health Department terminated a contract with the private hospital, resulting in 144 mentally ill patients dying. While 134 claimants of the tragedy were paid earlier this year, family members of over 1,700 affected patients have since come forward. Some of the family  members have accused the provincial government of continually changing the compensation deadline. However, the Premiers Office’s Thabo Masebe says there was no promise of a deadline for payment, He says government requires the families to provide verification of familial ties and that they have been allowed to represent the victims.
