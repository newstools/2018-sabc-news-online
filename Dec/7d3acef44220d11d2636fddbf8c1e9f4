Shack Dwellers movement Abahlali baseMjondolo are appearing in the High Court in Durban on Thursday, applying for an interdict to stop the eThekwini Municipality from carrying out evictions in the Cato Crest area in Durban. Spokesperson for the movement, Thapelo Mohapi, says the municipality’s Anti Land Invasion Unit has been evicting people’s for the past six months. He says the organisation is fighting for the poor whose wish is to be in their homes over the festive season. “For the past 6 months, the invasion unit has been rendering people homeless in Cato Crest. As usual, there has not been a court order. It is unfortunate that the municipality does not follow the law. So today, we are here to apply for a court interdict that is going to prevent the municipality from illegally and brutally evicting people.”
