Four Subantartic seals and one Antarctic seal have been released back into the ocean after been rescued by the Stranded Marine Animal Rescue Team (SMART).  This after five months of rehabilitation at the Bayworld Museum in Port Elizabeth, the seals have fully recovered and ready to survive the open seas. Herold, Iggy, Christine, Enda and Abel are finally heading home. They were rescued from various shores across the country. Rehabilitated by Greg Hofmeyer the seals are now ready to take the waves. “I think it was very successful. We had great trip out to sea. Everybody, I’ve spoken to, said it was absolutely fantastic. We achieved all we needed to do. We are now waiting for the next stae of things,” says Hofmeyer. The fur seals were released 60 kilometer southwest of the Algoa bay shores. They have been tagged with satellite tracking for research purposes and to monitor their movement. “We need to be able to find out if the programme is successful if we put them back into the sea. Are they going to survive and that’s why we put the satellite tags on them,” says Hofmeyer. The Department of Enviromental Affairs has welcomed the initiative. WATCH BELOW:
