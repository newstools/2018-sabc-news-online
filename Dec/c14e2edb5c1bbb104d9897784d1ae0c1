The social security agency SASSA says it cannot rule out the possibility that about 370 000 beneficiaries who have not collected the new gold card could have been getting social grants fraudulently. SASSA has extended to the end of December the deadline for social grants beneficiaries to obtain their new SASSA gold card. SASSA grant recipients who still use the old white cards will not be able to access their grants in January 2019.

We want to make sure that we reach-out to our people and we believe that they know what the law requires of them and we hope that they do what is right and come and swop their card.”
