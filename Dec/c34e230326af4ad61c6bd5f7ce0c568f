It’s emerged that alleged sexual abuse survivor Cheryl Zondi’s life is in danger. Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane revealed that there are threats to kill Zondi and other witnesses in the Timothy Omotoso rape case in Port Elizabeth. This emerged at a media briefing where the Cheryl Zondi Foundation was launched in Johannesburg on Tuesday.  The foundation will assist other young victims of sexual and emotional abuse in sacred spaces. Zondi has laid a complaint with Mkhwebane complaining about poor protection of witnesses in the witness protection programme. Mkhwebane says she has arranged a meeting with the Ministers of Police and Justice and Constitutional Development. “We were planning to meet by this week so that we can have an urgent intervention. I mean the matter is so serious and so scary in that apparently there’s information that there’s money which is promised to whoever can take the life of Cheryl and the other girls and I think it’s very urgent so we are trying our level best that we can meet, especially at ministerial leve;l they can then intervene,” says Mkhwebane.
