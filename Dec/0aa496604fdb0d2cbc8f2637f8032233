Light rain in the Hermanus area east of Cape Town has assisted fire fighters in bringing a vegetation fire under control that has been raging throughout the night at Karweiderskraal and Afdaksrivier. It started on Christmas Day. Fire Chief in the Overstrand Municipality, Lester Smith, says there have been no reports of serious damage to structures and property on farms. On Wednesday, some farm houses were threatened, but fire fighting personnel averted possible damage. Smith says they will assess the situation on Thursday morning. “The current status is all three flanks are under control, however there’s still hotspots, and fire fighters are continuing with mop-up operations during the night. The main objective today is to ensure all hotspots are put out, it was basic young plantations, agriculture land and fynbos, and some of the mountain areas that were burnt, and about 800 hectares were destroyed.”
