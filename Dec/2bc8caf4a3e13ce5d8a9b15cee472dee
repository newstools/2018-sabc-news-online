The Democratic Alliance and Economic Freedom Fighters have re-asserted their respective positions on the land issue, ahead of Tuesday’s vote in the National Assembly. The DA will debate and then vote on the report by the Constitutional Review Committee, that Section 25 of the Constitution should be amended to allow land expropriation without compensation. DA member of the committee, Thandeka Mbabama, has confirmed the party’s stance. “The DA’s position does not believe in expropriation without compensation and especially changing the constitution to allow for that, so we will be debating it in that way. We will be voting against the report, we will not be supporting the report.” The report is backed by the governing African National Congress and the Economic Freedom Fighters, among other parties. EFF spokesperson Mbuyiseni Ndlozi is confident that the majority of MPs in the House will vote in favour of the report, paving the way to start amending the property clause. “We are in this process at this stage and this is an important test of our democracy and its strength that we can be able to enter into a difficult conversation as a country that causes bloodshed and war in other countries.” “But we managed to enter into it and now we are coming up out of the other side without a single drop of blood. And we must commend and remain and recommit ourselves moving forward to a democratic peaceful process of  land distribution.” Related video click below:
