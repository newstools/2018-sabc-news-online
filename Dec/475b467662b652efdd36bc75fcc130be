The Democratic Alliance (DA) Councillor in the Mangaung Municipality in Bloemfontein Gauta Lebitsa has accused the party of being paranoid. This is after the DA terminated Lebitsa’s party membership. He is alleged to have colluded with the African National Congress (ANC) Provincial Secretary Paseka Nompondo to get the DA Councillors in the municipality to defect to the ANC. “I am a very sane and sober-minded person. I do not entertain madness of paranoid people. The DA and its leadership collective in the province and Mangaung is paranoid. Whatever they have briefed you about is subject to legal processes which, of course, they flouted and I’m not going to issue a comment on that until all the legal processes have been exhausted,” says Lebitsa
