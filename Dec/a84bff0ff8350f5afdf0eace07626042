Several activists, including the African Progressive Movement (APMO), came out in support of the protest picnic at Clifton’s Fourth Beach on Saturday. The picnic followed the alleged forceful removal of beachgoers last Sunday. Security guards belonging to the security company, Professional Protection Alternative, allegedly ordered them to leave the beach when they converged at the beach for their annual sunset picnic gathering. APMO has since called on the City of Cape Town to provide answers to the incident. An activist explained, “We are peacefully picnicking today to basically highlight the incompetence of our government to take responsibility for their action on the public. It was not racially motivated. Many things have been stripped away from us. We want competence and so far the City of Cape Town have not given us have not given us competence answers that is what we seek and we seek justice and there should consequences for what the PPA did.” Click on video below:
