Parliament’s Communications Committee has advertised for nominations for the eight vacant positions on the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) Board. The vacancies were created by the withdrawal of one person from the original list of 12 candidates recommended for appointment and seven other members who resigned, including four in the past few days. The committee’s Chairperson, Hlengiwe Mkhize, says nominated people must have expertise and experience in broadcasting, media law, journalism, business and finance as well as marketing. The closing date for nominations is the 21st of December. Watch a related video below:
