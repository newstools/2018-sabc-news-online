Congress of the People (COPE) says it has received the news of the death of Gauteng African National Congress (ANC) senior official Khabisi Mosunkutu with great sadness. COPE Spokesperson Dennis Bloem says Mosunkutu’s death is a loss, not only to his family, but the entire nation. Earlier, Mosunkutu’s widow described her husband as a wonderful husband and a loving father. She says he always supported and encouraged her to further her studies while he took care of their children. Mosunkuthu had not been well since he suffered a stroke in 2017. He died on Monday at the age of 69. Mosunkutu resigned from the provincial legislature in 2011 after more than a decade as a member of the Gauteng provincial executive in various portfolios. Nonqaba Mosunkutu recalls how her husband advised her to go back to school to improve her matric results. “I went to Naledi High just for one year in 1980, and then I completed my matric with an exemption. During that time he was looking after my kids, young as they were. And again in 1985, when I got my third child he was able to stay at home with my three-year-old boy. He has been a very wonderful husband, very supportive. As I was doing my BA in Theology, he was there looking after the kids. You’d never say he’s a politician. He was a family man,” says Nonqaba Mosunkutu. Click below for more on the story:
