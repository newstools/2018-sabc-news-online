Political analyst, Levy Ndou, says the person to take over as the next South African Revenue Services (SARS) Commissioner should have the ability to return credibility to the institution, as well as improve staff morale. This after President Cyril Ramaphosa fired the embattled Tom Moyane last month as recommended by the Nugent Commission interim report. Moyane unsuccessfully went to the courts to overturn his dismissal. Ndou says the President’s task of appointing a new commissioner will soon be initiated. He says the biggest challenge is credibility which is needed to assure ordinary citizens that they can trust SARS’ processes. He says there are serious divisions within the institution that are preventing processes and activities to run in a smooth manner. “What is painful is the staff morale, which is very low. You need a person that can unite all the divisions and ensure that we lift the morale and bring public confidence so everyone will say that we have an institution that is working in the interests of SA.” Watch interview below:
