Government has sent its condolences to the family of South African paramedic and rescue worker Mark Roxburgh who was killed in a helicopter crash in Ras al-Khaimah in the north-eastern region of the United Arab Emirates. Roxburgh and three other Emerati crew members died when their helicopter crashed while on a rescue mission. It allegedly clipped the ‘the world’s highest zip line’ on the UAE’s highest mountain, Jebel Jais. “The South African government conveys condolences to the UAE government following the helicopter crash. As you’re aware, a South African, Mr Roxburgh was involved in this accident and he has passed on. We’re in contact with his family; we’re assisting them with whatever we can do. We also want to send our condolences to his family, to his relatives. But also we want to send a message to the other families because this company also employs a number of South Africans,” says International Relations’ Ndivhuwo Mabaya.
