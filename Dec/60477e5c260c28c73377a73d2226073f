Western Cape Premier, Helen Zille, says she is going to take a finding by the Public Protector regarding her son to the High Court in Cape Town on review. The Public Protector, Busisiwe Mkhwebane, has found that Zille violated the executive members’ code of ethics. Mkhwebane says Zille facilitated her son’s company to utilise its software and educational resources through the use of tablets during recent revision workshops for learners. The public protector found that this is a conflict of interest on Zille’s part. Zille says there was no conflict of interest as she fulfilled the requirements of the law.
