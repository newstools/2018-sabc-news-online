The Enlightened Christian Gathering Church of prophet Shepard Bushiri in Pretoria says they are taking extra precautions for the New Year’s Eve service after three people died and nine were injured during a stampede at the church on Friday night. The stampede occurred as people tried to escape a storm. The legal representative of the church, Terence Baloyi, says they will conduct the service at the stadium at Tshwane Events Centre but will have five halls on stand-by if it rains. “As a church the lesson learned is basically that we are on guard, be it natural disasters or whatever may come unexpectedly. We need to ensure we have capacity, be it in the form of a shelter where people can hide, such as tents, if need be. “That’s what we’re working on. Also want to make sure as people come in. We direct them to the halls immediately, nobody should be loitering around because as a result this is what happens,” adds Baloyi.
