The City of Cape Town says the R193 million phase two of their project to roll out its MyCiti bus service to the Cape Flats will be completed by December 2020. Mayoral Committee Member for Transport, Felicity Purchase, says they are now preparing to turn Jan Smuts Drive into a dual carriageway between Turfhall road and Govan Mbeki road. Once completed, the MyCiti bus service will provide access for nearly 1.5 million residents from the outskirts of Khayelitsha and Mitchells Plain to the urban centres of Wynberg and Claremont. Purchase says this route was also chosen as it intersects with busy highways such as the M-5 and Jakes Gerwel Drive. Phase two, which commences in January will include the construction of the new lanes on Jan Smuts Drive.
