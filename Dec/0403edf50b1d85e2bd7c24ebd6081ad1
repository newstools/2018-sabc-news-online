Marike Vermaak, convicted of child neglect for the death of her three-year-old son, will be back at the High Court in Johannesburg to seek a renewal of bail. Vermaak, also known as Mary, had previously been out on bail, but this fell away upon her conviction on Thursday. Her partner and father of her two other children, Timothy Naidoo, was found guilty of murder and child abuse. Baby Daniel died in June last year after sustaining burn wounds to 60% of his body. The autopsy was unable to determine whether the child died as a result of the burns or blunt force trauma. These injuries could be likened to a head on collision, with the court rejecting Naidooâ€™s explanation that the child kept slipping in the bath. Vermaak was found guilty on two counts of neglect, one of which was related to the murder. She has been out on
R2 000 bail, while Naidoo was awaiting trial in prison. Vermaak wants bail pending sentencing. If granted she might be able to go home for Christmas. Watch related video:
