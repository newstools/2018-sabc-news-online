The search is on for a male lion on the loose in the Vryheid area in northern KwaZulu-Natal and nature conservation authorities have warned the community to be on alert. Ezemvelo KZN Wildlife spokesperson Musa Mntambo says the lion has been roaming around for the past two weeks and has attacked one person, who managed to survive the incident. Mntambo says it’s still unclear where the lion came from. “I can confirm that we have received reports that recently, a week or two ago, a man who was walking around that area was attacked by a lion. He survived the lion attack and then we don’t know where the lion came from and so far we have not even captured the lion.” Mntambo has a contact number for anybody who spots the wild beast. “In the past we’ve done everything; we’ve done lion call up, we’ve went there and searched through the area. We didn’t find anything right now,  we rely on the community because when they see this lion they must call. Imfact, they must call Jabulani Biyela, his cell number 0827088860, who will then rush to where the lion might be.”
