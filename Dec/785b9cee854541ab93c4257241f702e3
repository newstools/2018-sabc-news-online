The African National Congress (ANC) in the Western Cape has called on the Speaker of the Provincial Parliament, Sharna Fernandez, to convene a special session to discuss the finding that Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane made against Premier Helen Zille. Mkhwebane found that Zille violated the executive members’ code of ethics. The Public Protector says Zille allowed her son’s company to utilise government software and educational resources through the use of tablets during revision workshops for learners in 2014. She found that this was a conflict of interest on Zille’s part. ANC provincial spokesperson, Dennis Cruywagen, says the special sitting should take place early next year. “It must happen within 14 days after the Speaker has received the report. So we would envisage that would be sometime in January. We believe that the Speaker has been protecting Premier Zille for far too long and it’s time that Premier Zille is held to account,” adds Cruywagen.
