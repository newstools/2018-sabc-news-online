Opposition parties in the Moretele Local Municipality, north of Pretoria, are alleging corruption in the municipality. Information provided to SABC News shows that some projects dating back to 2007 have not yet been completed. One such project is the Mmakaunyane Sports Complex. Initially R3 million was budgeted for this project, but the figure has since increased to R4 million. But the sports complex has been abandoned and the area is now overgrown. A local councillor for the Agenda to Citizenry Governance, Shangi Mbekwa, says as a result of the lack of accountability in the municipality, residents are struggling. “During rainy days, learners are struggling to go to school, educators are struggling to get to school, and nurses are struggling to get to our local clinics. We’re talking about darkest areas, it’s in Moretele. We’ve got 72 villages, only 14 villages out of 72, have got high mast lights. The rest of the areas are dark, and then crime is so high,” adds Mbekwa. Moretele Municipal spokesperson, Abel Malebye, has dismissed allegations of corruption, calling on anyone with information to report to law enforcement agencies. “Sometimes a project, say we plan R100 000, and then you find that we are going to take three financial years on that project. Some of the projects, we cannot complete it one year, it’s a long process,” adds Malebye.
