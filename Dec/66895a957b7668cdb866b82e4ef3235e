As the last weekend of festivities begins, thousands of revelers are expected to travel to various destinations for the year-end celebrations. With the spotlight on road safety during this time, Transport Minister, Blade Nzimande, warned motorists of harsher punishment. More than 1 800 people have died in fatal crashes on South African roads this festive season.  This is a 16 % increase of the road death toll compared to the same period last year. In KwaZulu-Natal, 234 people lost their lives. The N3 Tugela toll plaza near Ladysmith, in northern KwaZulu-Natal, saw an increase in traffic with thousands of cars passing through. Authorities have cautioned road users to adhere to the rules of the road  and road traffic officials will be out in full force for the duration of the festive season.
