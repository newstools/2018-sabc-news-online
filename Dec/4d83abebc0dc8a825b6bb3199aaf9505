Archbishop Elias Mureri of the United African Apostolic Church (UAAC) has been laid to rest at his home village of Ha-Mavhunga in Nzhelele outside Louis Trichardt in Limpopo. Mureri died last Saturday after being at the helm of the UAAC for 40 years. The apostolic church is one of the country’s largest African indigenous churches, with about two million members. Mourners and dignitaries from as far as Zambia, Botswana and Zimbabwe came to pay their last respects. The renowned faith healer was described as humble, generous and loving. The Miriri family says he sacrificed his well-being for the benefit of the community. “As a family we could have a lot of time with him – he was always away with other men if God. We have lost a great man as family it has affected us badly,” says David Miriri, family spokesperson. “We stand here today as strong women because if our spiritual father so we say to Miriri family be strong our father taught us to pray,” says Anna Ramalamula, UAAC Women leader. “There is quite a lot of things he has done he has sent so many kids to varsity 18 to be exact who found themselves enrolled in institutions of higher learning. He also sent us out to visit the homes of the needy,” says Ndivhuwo Ramutsheli, of the UAAC Youth Movement. The Minister of Mineral Resources, Gwede Mantashe, conveyed a message of condolence from President Cyril Ramaphosa. “Many independent churches that were looked down upon majority of the time actually were part of the revival of the spirit of resistance that is the message from the president,” says Mantashe. The church will elect a new leader in due course.
