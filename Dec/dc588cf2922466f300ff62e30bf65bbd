More than 30 stranded turtles have been rescued from the beaches around Indonesia’s Banten Province following a deadly tsunami that occurred on 22 December. Endangered hawksbill turtles had been found stranded along Tanjong Lesung beach, a popular resort destination, after the tsunami hit a week ago. The turtles were around 1 meter long, according to local media reports. Video posted by Indonesia’s search and rescue agency, Basarnas, showed men carrying sea turtles along a shore littered with debris from the tsunami and releasing them into the ocean. An undersea landslide following the collapse of a part the Anak Krakatau volcano in the Sunda Strait led to waves of up to 5 meters hitting coasts between Indonesia’s Java and Sumatra islands. More than 400 people have been killed.
