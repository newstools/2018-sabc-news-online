Consumers should remain vigilant to avoid falling victim to theft and fraud this festive season. The South African Banking Risk Information Centre (SABRIC) has warned that increased economic activities means greater opportunity for criminals to swoop on unsuspecting shoppers and holiday makers. SABRIC’s Head of Strategic Services, Susan Potgieter says many of the known crime techniques can be easily avoided. “Card swooping at ATMs remain prevalent and we urge consumers never to accept assistance from a stranger. When using the ATM always remember to cover the hand that types in your pin number. This will prevent criminals from looking over your shoulder or using spy cameras and should your card be retained or stolen, the criminal will not have your pin number. If your card has been retained please do not move away from the ATM until you have actually cancelled your card,” says Potgieter.
