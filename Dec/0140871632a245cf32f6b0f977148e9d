Law enforcement officers in the Free State have expressed concern over a spate of road fatalities in the province. Twenty-eight people have been killed in several crashes in the province since the beginning of December. Authorities say they are on high alert for any eventuality. They have pleaded with motorists to exercise maximum caution. The Free State is surrounded by six provinces and this often leads to high traffic volumes and an increase in crashes. Despite this, most holiday-makers are satisfied with the road safety campaigns. More traffic officials will be deployed to hotspot areas. Motorists have been urged to take regular rests to avoid fatigue.
