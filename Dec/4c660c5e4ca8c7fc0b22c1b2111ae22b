The South African Federation of Trade Unions (Saftu) says it’s planning to stage a two-day total shutdown in March 2019. The federation says the protest will be felt across all cities and towns and it will involve the unemployed, the homeless and the employed. Saftu’s Zwelinzima Vavi says the unemployment situation in South Africa has deteriorated since 1994 and this must change. Vavi says they have roped in civil rights groups and religious leaders to come on board. “The central lesson we learned is that we need to get the poor to speak in one voice. We need to defeat the deliberate divisions by the ruling class. Create a gap between organized workers, unorganized workers and their unemployed counterparts,” says Vavi.
