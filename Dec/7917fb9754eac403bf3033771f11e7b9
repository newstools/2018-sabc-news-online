The South Africa Social Security Agency (Sassa) has extended the deadline for social grant beneficiaries to obtain their new Sassa gold card up until the end of December. Sassa grant recipients who still use the old white cards will not be able to access their grants in January 2019. Sassa spokesperson, Paseka Letsatsi says there are still about 370 000 beneficiaries who still need to change their cards. “We just want to appeal to them to come forth and change their cards. The Sassa offices and South African Post Office (Sapo) offices are going to be open throughout December closed only on public holidays. We expect our beneficiaries to come in, it takes about 5-minutes for a beneficiary to come in and change the card. So it goes beyond 3-months and a beneficiary does not come to change their card we regard that as a dormant account so we de-activate and close the account permanently,” adds Letsatsi.
