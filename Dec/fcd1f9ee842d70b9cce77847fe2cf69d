The water supply challenges in the western areas of the City of Tshwane have been resolved. Residents were left without water during the past week after Rand Water was forced to reduce its water supply to areas including Centurion, Valhalla, Atteridgeville and Laudium. This was due to a faulty water pump.  Meanwhile, residents have been urged to continue using water sparingly, as Gauteng is a water stressed province. Darryl Moss Tshwane Infrastructure MMC says: “We battled to manage our own reservoirs. They were running dry because Rand Water wasn’t pumping in. But according to the latest information we have, Tweefontein is pumping again. Our reservoirs have certainly been normalised and we are feeding as we normally do.”
