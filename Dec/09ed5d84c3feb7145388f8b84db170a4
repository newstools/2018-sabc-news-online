The High Court in Johannesburg has reserved judgment in City of Johannesburg Mayor Herman Mashaba‘s application for an interdict against his predecessor, Parks Tau. Mashaba is accusing Tau, the Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) and the African National Congress Women’s League (ANCWL) of defaming his character. This follows a speech given by Tau at a funeral in 2016 where he allegedly characterised Mashaba as sexist and self-hating. This was after Mashaba vowed to clean the city of what he termed “women managers that had been appointed by their boyfriends” shortly after he was elected as Mayor. Mashaba wants the court to grant him the interdict pending the finalisation of the defamation case. “What does prostitution got to do with the employment of girlfriends? We know in this country, it’s a fact. We have seen it in government departments, in SADTU jobs for pals, these are known factors in this country and we need to stop it. How do you relate it to prostitution? Our women have been exploited by men to get employment opportunities and we got to stop this evil practice,” says Mashaba. The ANC chairperson in Johannesburg Geoffrey Makhubo believes Tau will win the case. “No we think our chances are quite good because here they were seeking an interim order, relief however the main trial will be later, where the defamation case will be heard. For now the judgment has been reserved. We think we are confident like our counsel said you can’t unring the bell, you can’t unscramble an egg, this thing was said two years ago now he is saying he is encountering harm everyday which is not true we are waiting for the judge to rule on that.” WATCH PARKS TAU IN 2016 BELOW:
