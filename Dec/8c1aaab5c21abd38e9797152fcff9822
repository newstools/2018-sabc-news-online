The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) has accused South African National Editors’ Forum (Sanef) and some journalists of being fascist and biased in their reporting. This follows Sanef’s decision to approach the Equality Court over the EFF’s intimidating treatment of journalists. Sanef confirmed on Wednesday that it lodged a complaint with the court against the party and its leader Julius Malema over the matter. The EFF says it will challenge the application. EFF Spokesperson Mbuyiseni Ndlozi says Sanef is trying to shut down the EFF to campaign for the ruling party. “They are fascist. They are trying to shutdown down debate. They are saying we must be told to stop criticising journalists and we’re not going to do that. Those journalists and media personalities that we have named, we have named them because they use their columns to campaign for Pravin Gordhan and the Thuma Mina people. And we are going to treat them precisely as that. They have taken a side. They are not independent; they are not neutral; so we are going to target them and we are going to target them intellectually and ideologically. They can demonstrate which EFF members have intimidated them. They must do that in court and we are ready to challenge them.”
