President Cyril Ramaphosa has announced Advocate Shamila Batohi as the new National Director of Public Prosecutions (NDPP) at the Union Buildings on Tuesday afternoon. The NDPP heads the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA), which has been accused in recent years of failing to act against rampant crime and corruption in the country. Many analysts say a new and independent NDPP will greatly assist in combating corruption and crime in South Africa. Batohi was among five candidates shortlisted after interviews by an advisory panel chaired by Minister of Energy Jeff Radebe. Watch related video below:
