Police confirmed that the whereabouts of Mongezi Mcunukelwa and Sbonelo Nkosingiphile Thwala are still unknown. Mcunukelwa, who is alleged to be a serial killer from Katlehong, east of Johannesburg, abandoned his bail application in the Palm Ridge Magistrate’s Court on Tuesday. For safety, judges had to hide in their officers for about an hour. Ekurhuleni  SAPS Spokesperson Lieutenant (Lt) Mavela Masondo has urged the community to help find these criminals. “We are still investigating but we don’t want to give much information at this stage and how they escaped but we are appealing to the community to please help us because we are still looking for the two awaiting trial prisoners who escaped yesterday.” It is still unclear how the two men escaped but Lt Masondo says that drastic steps will be taken if there is any wrong doing from the police department as the prisoners did not have leg irons on. “These are dangerous criminals that we are talking about… they were appearing on charges of murder. We were expecting them to have leg irons, but we are still investigating that in this case how come they didn’t have leg irons on.” Click on related interview: <a href="https://iono.fm/e/633800">Content hosted by iono.fm</a> Watch related video:
