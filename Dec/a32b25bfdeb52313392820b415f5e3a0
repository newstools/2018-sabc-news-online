Police Minister Bheki Cele says they are acting strongly against foreign nationals who travel without proper documents and motorists driving unroadworthy vehicles. Cele was speaking during festive season’s operations in Polokwane. A number of illegal immigrants were arrested and unroadworthy vehicles were impounded. Cele says the laws of the country must be obeyed by everyone. “We believe that the enthusiasm of police will help to keep people safe. A lot of people there are without papers and as South Africa authority we need to act. South Africa as a country, we have our integrity and sovereignty and we must respect those things.” Meanwhile, some people say they are grateful that Minister Cele is taking part in the safety operations. “So far so good we have not yet found any challenges along the road so far so good, and they are doing a good job. I am sure if they continue this way we will be safe. They are doing their job which is a good thing. Nothing wrong. The road is busy but it seems they are maintaining good order in this festive time.  I have seen in a lot of traffic cops this time of the year. It’s very necessary especially this time of the year to see a lot of police present.”
