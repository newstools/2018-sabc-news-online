The Nelspruit High Court in Mpumalanga has postponed the case of disgruntled African National Congress (ANC) members who seek a court order to disband the party’s Provincial Executive Committee (PEC). The group says bogus branches influenced the election of the PEC. Divisions in the ANC in Mpumalanga continue to emerge and a group of ANC members claim that the current provincial leadership was not properly constituted. The disgruntled members took the matter to court after the ANC’s National Dispute Resolution Committee allegedly failed to resolve it. ANC member, William Nkatha, is with the faction that took the party to court. “Between ourselves and the council of the ANC, we could not agree on the date because they are proposing that the case must sit after April. At that time we are dealing with matters that are not stagnant, they continue to have irregularities in branches of the ANC, so it’s only the court that can stop that that is why we are here today,” says Nkatha. The disgruntled group demands that the PEC be dissolved and want a task team to run the party in the run up to next year’s elections. Despite all these challenges, the provincial leadership believes that the party can still resolve the challenges internally. “We are still willing to engage because what we want out of everything, it’s not a winners take. All that we want is to create one united ANC in the province no matter what individual interests are,” says provincial Treasurer, Vusi Shongwe. The case has been postponed to a date yet to be announced. Watch a related video below:
