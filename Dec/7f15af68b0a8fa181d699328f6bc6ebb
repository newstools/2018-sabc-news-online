The Mangaung Metro says there is high turbidity in the Welbedacht dam as a result of the recent rainfall experienced in the Caledon river catchment area. The river and dam are full of sand and this affects operations at the water treatment works as theÂ  water is too sandy and takes longer to purify. Spokesperson Qondile Khedama says this calls for process controllers to reduce the outflow at the high lift pump station. He says this will affect levels at the main reservoirs that are supplied by the mainline from Welbedacht to Bloemfontein. Khedama says Bloem Water is working around the clock to address the problem at the plant and that the water quality will not be compromised.
