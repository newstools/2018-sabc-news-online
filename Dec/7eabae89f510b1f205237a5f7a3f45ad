Health Minister, Aaron Motsoaledi, has announced the appointment of Professor Dan Mkhize as the new Administrator of Mental Health Services in the Eastern Cape. This is part of the recommendations of the health ombudsman, Malegapuru Makgoba, in a report which looked into the allegations of mismanaging patients and violating the rights of psychiatric patients at Tower Hospital in Fort Beaufort. Professor Mkhize, a specialist in psychiatry, is on a six-month contract which is subject to renewal. Motsoaledi says he has confidence in Mkhize’s abilities. “He has got vast academic and clinical experience in the field of mental health. As a professor of psychiatry at the University of KwaZulu-Natal and as a clinician in both public and private sector and I’m very confident that he will do a good job. Whoever was heading the directorate of mental health will be reporting to him,” Motsoaledi.
