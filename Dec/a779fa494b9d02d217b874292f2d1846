Emergency personnel in the Free State say they are determined to save lives. This despite a shortage of resources and recent attacks while responding to emergency situations. Paramedics are often the first to arrive at emergency scenes. Their safety is of paramount importance and so is the inspection of emergency vehicles and health equipment. Paramedic Voele Mohale says:”I love to save lives of our people because anything that happens to them affects me because it’s our people. It’s for the love of our people that’s why I’m here.” A call has been made for emergency services personnel to be provided with firearms. The Free State is the only province operating an aero medical at a public hospital. It can reach the most far-flung areas in the Free State in less than 45 minutes. With more road carnage this festive season, paramedics are crucial. Emergency care technician Cindy Sentry says:”Before we prepare for take off  we check all our equipment is ready for work, then after that there’s some other equipment that’s not always on the helicopter.” Free State paramedics have their hands full. At least 78 people have been killed in road crashes in the Free State since the beginning of December. WATCH RELATED VIDEOS BELOW:
