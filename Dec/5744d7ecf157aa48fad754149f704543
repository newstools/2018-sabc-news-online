The Department of Correctional Services has conducted surprise inspections in prisons across the country as part of Operation Vala. In Johannesburgâ€™s Sun City prison, a lot of items were confiscated including cellphones and weapons. Deputy Minister of Justice and Correctional Services Thabang Makwetla says they hope to intensify these types of searches. The operation comes after a Pretoria inmate was found with expensive bags, cellphones and even cash in his single cell earlier in November. The surprise raid saw all the inmates being lined up in the courtyard, while warders, led by the Deputy Minister conducted the search. Among the items found were drugs, money, cellphones and makeshift weapons. For example, warders found heating elements removed from old kettles to be used as knives.
