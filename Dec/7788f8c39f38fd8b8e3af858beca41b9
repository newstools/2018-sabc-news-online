Democratic Alliance (DA) leader Mmusi Maimane says it is time to rebuild a “reconciled and a just” South Africa. He was addressing hundreds of party supporters as part of Reconciliation Day Celebrations in Eldorado Park, Johannesburg on Sunday. He says justice needs to be exercised in all spheres of government and by the society as a whole in order for all citizens to live in harmony. Maimane says South Africans are longing to be part of a country that is democratic, with all people living in peace – irrespective of their race, culture and religious beliefs. “I believe today we are seeing in our country reconciliation is starting to fail. So, we need a reconciled and a just South Africa.” “So, today, we want it to be Reconciliation and Justice Day because when we talk about justice is when we can build a community and fight for the rights of a community like eGwatyu and for them to own land. So, for us it’s a significant day for all for us.”
