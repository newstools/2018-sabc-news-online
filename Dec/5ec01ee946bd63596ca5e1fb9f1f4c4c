Two truck drivers have been arrested and are facing charges of human trafficking. This after police in Rustenburg in the North West found about 29 undocumented Zimbabwe nationals being transported by the suspects. It is alleged that children aged between 15 months and 15 years, together with 15 other adults aged between 19 and 54 were found in a mini truck trailer on the R24 road known as the Old Johannesburg road. It is reported that all the illegal migrants were being transported to Cape Town. North West Hawks Spokesperson Tlangelani Rikhotso says the arrested truck drivers will appear at the Rustenburg magistrate’s court next week Wednesday. “Twelve unaccompanied and undocumented minors aged between three and 15 years have been taken to a place of safety. Two other unaccompanied and undocumented minors were taken with their mothers to a place of safety as well. The rest of the adults were charged under the  Immigration Act.”
