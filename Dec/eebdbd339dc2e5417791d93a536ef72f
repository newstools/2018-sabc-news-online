The Health Department in the North West is heading into a legal battle with the controversial Gupta-linked Mediosa company – which was supposedly providing health services in the province’s remote areas. The company was paid R30 million in advance. This action then led to the suspension of Departmental Head, Thabo Lekalakala. He is currently facing a disciplinary hearing. With the department no longer paying, Mediosa tried unsuccessfully to seize its clinics in August. Former Health MEC Magome Masike says they are questioning the accuracy of Mediosa’s invoices. “The invoice would be having patients that are almost three or four times the people that live in that village and that is the controversy. We want to pay what we believe they’ve performed and they’ve not been able to prove to us the numbers they’ve provided and to identify those patients, and that is why we are still not paying them,” adds Masike.
