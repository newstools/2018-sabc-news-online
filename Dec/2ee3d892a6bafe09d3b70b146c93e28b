The man that the Alexandra community accused of starting a fire that swept through about 150 shacks on Thursday, has died of the wounds he sustained when they attacked him. The blaze has displaced hundreds of people and caused aid organisations to appeal for donations. It’s alleged that the man started the fire after he had a fight with his girlfriend. Angry residents were about to stone him when police came to his rescue. Gauteng provincial police spokesperson, Mavela Masondo, explains: “We have opened an inquiry. We started with our investigation as to how the fire started to find out if there is anyone who started the fire intentionally. As for now we are appealing to the people to come please forward and give us a statement as to what it is  that they saw. The person who was allegedly assaulted by the community yesterday he passed on in hospital last night.”
