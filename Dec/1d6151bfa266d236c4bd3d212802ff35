African National Congress (ANC’s) Provincial Task Team in the North West has decided to recall, with immediate effect, six of its mayors in the province, including four who invested money from their municipalities in the collapsed VBS Mutual Bank. The Reserve Bank says about R1.9 billion was looted from VBS. Spokesperson, ANC NW Provincial Task Team Kabelo Mataboge says that these mayors negatively represented the ANC and were not thinking about the best interest of the people.
