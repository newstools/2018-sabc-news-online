A handful of Economic Freedom Fighterâ€™s (EFF) members have come to support their leaders who are testifying before the Moerane Commission sitting in Durban. The Commission is investigating political killings in KwaZulu-Natal. On Thursday the provincial Deputy Director of the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) Advocate Cyril Selepe told the Commission that the killings at the notorious Glebelands hostel are not politically related but are due to pure criminality. He further revealed that since 2011, the NPA has received only 49 cases which are politically related in the province. EFF Deputy Secretary General Hlengiwe Mkhaliphi and party spokesperson Mbuyiseni Ndlozi have been sworn in to kick off their testimony.
