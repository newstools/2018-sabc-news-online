Hawks officials have arrested former Free State Agriculture Head Peter Thabethe in connection with the controversial Estina Dairy project in Vrede. A group of Hawks investigators raided the department’s offices at Glen College outside Bloemfontein Wednesday morning. Thabethe was arrested at his home. The department is the one that controlled the Vrede dairy farm that has been linked to the Gupta’s family. The Hawks also raided the Gupta family home in Saxonwold, north of Johannesburg, in what is believed to be part of a larger probe into alleged state capture and allegations of corruption related to the Estina dairy farm.  Three people have been arrested thus far and two others are expected to hand themselves over to the police.     About Thabiso Radebe View all posts by Thabiso Radebe
