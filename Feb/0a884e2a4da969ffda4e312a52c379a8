African Independent Congress (AIC) leader, Mandla Galo, says they’ve written to the Minister in the Presidency, Jeff Radebe about the Public Participation Hearings on the re-incorporation of Matatiele to KwaZulu-Natal. Galo says they’re unhappy that the Eastern Cape Legislature will on Thursday hold public hearings at two different venues in Matatiele. He says the AIC wants the legislatures of the Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal to jointly hold the hearings. “We wanted the Public hearings to be conducted in one place and be conducted jointly by the legislature of KZN and the Eastern Cape, so that when they are reporting to the ministry of Cogta in Pretoria they are giving one report.” About Nkululeko Nyembezi View all posts by Nkululeko Nyembezi
