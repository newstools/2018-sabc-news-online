Two people have been killed, while seven others were injured in a shootout at a taxi rank in Langa on the Cape Flats, Cape Town in the Western Cape  on Thursday morning. This comes as four people have been killed this month in taxi related violence between rival groups of the Cape Amalgamated Taxi Association (CATA), who are fighting over a route to Athlone. Police spokesperson Andre Traut refused to confirm whether the latest incident is linked to the ongoing conflict within CATA. Traut said, “The circumstances around the death of two people are being investigated following a shooting incident this morning at the Langa Taxi rank. Seven other people were wounded and taken to hospital.” The motive is yet to be established he added, and says an unidentified number of suspects fled the scene.
