Eskom head of generation Matshela Koko has resigned amid his disciplinary hearing which started on Friday. This has been confirmed by Eskom spokesperson Khulu Phasiwe. Koko was on his second suspension. He had also taken the utility to the Labour Court to preventing Eskom from firing him. Since the new board took over about two weeks ago, several Eskom executives have resigned or are being suspended. Phasiwe says there are about 160 cases of more than R1 billion that they are now opening and reinvestigating and over 500 of less than R1 billion. “Eskom can confirm that it has received a letter from Koko’s lawyer informing them of his resignation with immediate effect, because the matter is still at labour court we will hear what the chair says going forward. Based on the precedent when a person resigns the disciplinary case will have to collapse.”   About Tshepo Mongoai View all posts by Tshepo Mongoai
