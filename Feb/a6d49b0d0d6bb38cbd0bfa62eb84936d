The African National Congress (ANC) in Johannesburg says any of its members who are involved in a group calling itself #ZumaMustGoNow, will face disciplinary action. The group is calling for a national shutdown on Monday – if President Jacob Zuma does not step down. The ANC’s National Executive Committee (NEC) will also be meeting Monday to decide Zuma’s fate. The #ZumaMustGoNow group are expected to protest at the Union Buildings in Pretoria. The ANC’s Jolidee Matongo says as the Johannesburg region they distance themselves from the #ZumaMustGoNow group. “As an ANC member you should know there is a national process outlined by the office bearers and working committee, on how to deal with the transition. So anything done outside of that is tantamount to ill-discipline, and these people… their membership will be verified… if they are indeed ANC members they will certainly be disciplined in accordance of the code of conduct of the ANC.”  Click below to watch videos:    About Sashin Naidoo View all posts by Sashin Naidoo
