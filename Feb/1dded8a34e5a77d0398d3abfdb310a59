African National Congress (ANC) Secretary General Ace Magashule and Deputy Secretary General Jessie Duarte have arrived at President Jacob Zuma’s official residence in Pretoria to deliver him a formal letter of recall from the governing party. This comes soon after the ANC postponed its media briefing on the matter from 12:00 until 14:00. The party says the reason is to inform its structures of the NEC’s decision and to send the president a formal letter of recall. The briefing follows the marathon meeting held by the party’s National Executive committee in Irene outside Pretoria last night, where the NEC decided to call for a motion of no confidence in Zuma if he persists in refusing to accept his recall.
