President Jacob Zuma’s son Edward has taken issue with his father’s fifth wife‚ first lady Thobeka Madiba-Zuma‚ over a picture she posted of her and Zuma, captioned “things are about to get ugly”. He says the post is unfortunate and regrettable. On Friday, Madiba-Zuma posted a photo of herself and the president on Instagram, saying, in isiZulu, “It’s going get rough, don’t fight with someone who is not fighting you” Edward Zuma says, “I think it was unfortunate if it’s true those were the words of the first lady. I think if you remember what happened to Robert Mugabe; it was Grace Mugabe who sped up the demise of her husband by making pronouncements at rallies at public places that offended the leadership of ZANU PF. That offended the military that offended the country. I think it’s unfortunate. It was good that the family decided to respond and distance itself because this was not good. Particularly, South Africans were offended; ANC members were offended.” Watch below for more:   About SABC View all posts by SABC
