Economist Azar Jammine has warned that South Africa can forget about sustaining the current positive economic sentiment if the government implements some of the African National Congress policies. At its National Elective Conference at Nasrec in Johannesburg in December 2017, the ANC resolved to implement the expropriation of land without compensation and introduce free higher education. However, Jammine says Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba knows that implementing such policies would be what he terms a colossal blunder. “Gigaba seems to have learnt a lot in the few months which he has been in office and I think he’s realising that it’s not a free lunch to just go out and spend like crazy.” About SABC View all posts by SABC
