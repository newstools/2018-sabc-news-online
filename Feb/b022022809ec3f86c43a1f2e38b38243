Police Minister Bheki Cele says security at the Ngcobo Police Station in the Eastern Cape will be beefed up soon, to ensure that officers are not easy targets for criminals. Speaking on Tuesday at the memorial service for the five police officers and a retired soldier, the newly appointed Police Minister said the brutal killing of police officers cannot be tolerated and says they will make sure that the police station is in good condition. Cele said: “The National Commissioner and myself  we will come here and look at the physical structure especially things like the police station, the IT at the police station, the CCTV  and everything so that police are safe.” He has urged police to use excessive force only when it is necessary to protect themselves and the community against criminals, saying they must not die holding their work guns. “We give police tools to defending themselves, not encouraging police to be rogue, but at the same time we are not preparing them, we do not train them to come here and be killed but to serve and help the community…” added Cele. Meanwhile, news reports on Wednesday morning said another suspect was arrested in connection to the Ngcobo killing.  eNgcobo Killings by Meet The Artist Africa About Nkululeko Nyembezi View all posts by Nkululeko Nyembezi
