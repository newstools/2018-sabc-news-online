African National Congress (ANC) Limpopo Chairperson Stan Mathabatha is the latest senior party official to assure party members and the country at large that the National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting taking place outside Pretoria Monday will close the transition impasse. Mathabatha, also premier of Limpopo, was addressing a Provincial Executive Committee (PEC) Lekgotla at Mokopane. His address came hours before Mathabatha and ANC provincial secretary, Knox Seabi, form part of the ANC NEC special meeting. “The unprecedented developments we have observed in the recent past, such as the postponement of the SONA and the related commitments of the President of the republic are matters of great concern to all of us… like it has already been announced, we will be attending the NEC meeting this afternoon – and definitely this matter will come to an end today, it will be resolved Monday.” Click below to watch videos:  About Pimani Baloyi View all posts by Pimani Baloyi
