Services have been crippled at the National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) in Cape Town as workers have downed tools for a second day. NSFAS spokesperson Kagisho Mamabolo says workers affiliated to National Union of Health and Allied Workers Union (Nehawu) are not happy over performance management and job evaluation systems. He says negotiations with the union are continuing. “The normal operations are affected and the management has as far as possible made some arrangements to attend to critical operational matters during this time. The walk in centre where students would normally walk in and get assisted is temporarily closed, the response level on our contact centre is also very slow, and as you could understand that it wouldn’t be business as usual,” says Mamabolo.
