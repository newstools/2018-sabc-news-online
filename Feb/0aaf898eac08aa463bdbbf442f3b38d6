The Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) is scheduled to testify on Monday in Durban before the Moerane Commission investigating political killings in KwaZulu-Natal. The IEC is expected to shed light on forced by-elections when a ward councillor has been killed. Evidence before the Commission has been that some people see being a councillor as a means to gaining income and will want to stay in the position at all cost. Councillors and municipal officials are amongst the victims who have been gunned down in the province. The Commission is expected to wrap up its work at the end of March. This past week the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) also gave its testimony to the Commission.  Click below to a watch related video:  About Nonkululeko Hlophe View all posts by Nonkululeko Hlophe
