The National Police Department says the conviction of former Western Cape top cop, Arno Lamoer, sends a strong message to the men in blue that crime doesn’t pay. The former Provincial Police Commissioner was on Monday found guilty of corruption in the High Court in Cape Town. Lamoer and three of his co-accused, two former Brigadiers and a Cape Town businessman were acquitted on charges of racketeering and money laundering. Department spokesperson Vuyo Mhaga says Minister Fikile Mbalula has welcomed the judgment. “This must serve as a warning to all people who are involved in corruption in particular with the police who should serve and protect the people of South Africa. Nothing under the sun will stop the law to actually pursue them… so we are actually welcoming this particular judgment,” adds Mhaga.   About SABC Radio View all posts by SABC Radio
