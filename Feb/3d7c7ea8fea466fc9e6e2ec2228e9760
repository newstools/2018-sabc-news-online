The case of a couple accused of a decade-long abuse of their five children will resume Monday in the High Court in Pretoria. The charges they are facing include attempted murder, attempted obstruction of justice, child abuse and neglect. The suspects have pleaded not guilty to all the charges. However, the father who is dubbed “The Springs Monster” pleaded guilty to one charge of stopping police from doing their work when they searched for one of his children in May 2014. In a court case appearance last year, the wife testified that she had a difficult childhood and said her mother chose her boyfriend over her. About ANA View all posts by ANA
