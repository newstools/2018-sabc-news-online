A memorial service for the five slain Ngcobo police officers in the Eastern Cape will be held at the town on Tuesday morning. They were gunned down at the Ngcobo police station early on Wednesday by balaclava-clad suspects who also took at least 10 firearms. Four people have now been taken in for questioning. During his visit at the police station on Wednesday afternoon, police minister Fikile Mbalula promised that the officers will be given a dignified funeral. Mbalula mentioned that the police service has a bursary scheme that caters for the children of police officers, promising that their children will be taken care of. It’s not clear if any of the suspects being questioned will be charged. Police say their investigation is at an advanced stage and wouldn’t divulge any further information.
