Residents in President Jacob Zuma‘s hometown Nkandla in northern KwaZulu-Natal have differing views about his time as the country’s number one citizen. He was recalled by the ANC National Executive Committee on Tuesday. He’s yet to announce his decision about his future which has kept the country on tenterhooks. Some of Zuma’s fellow residents in Nkandla added their voice, with one resident saying Zuma should be given a chance to complete his term. “My view is that Zuma must not step down. Let him finish his term. He has a few months left on his term. We still want him. We have seen development around this area under his leadership. There’s water, electricity and also proper roads.” Other residents however feel that Zuma’s term in office has done nothing to address unemployment in the area. “Our children are unemployed. Zuma has not brought any meaningful contribution in our lives. There are no job opportunities in this area. A lot of youth are without jobs.” About Vusi Khumalo View all posts by Vusi Khumalo
