The Lesotho government has alerted its National Security Services to investigate allegations that fugitive Ajay Gupta is in that country. Gupta is wanted by the Hawks in connection with corruption charges. Lesotho Government Secretary Moahloli Mphaka has assured South Africa of its full cooperation. “We have put that matter onto the national security services and the police to investigate that matter but I should reject that we have such person who has been housed in Lesotho and how it came out in the social media. It says he was collected from the border by the VIP protection and is being housed in the state house. There is no such a thing, the Prime Minister of Lesotho and his government cannot do that to harbour people who are regarded to be criminals in South Africa.” Watch related videos:   About Chriselda Lewis View all posts by Chriselda Lewis
