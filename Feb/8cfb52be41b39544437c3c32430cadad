The joint sitting of the Paliament’s National Assembly (NA) and National Council of Provinces (NCOP) will host 2018’s State of the Nation Address (Sona) on Friday evening. Newly elected President Cyril Ramaphosa will deliver the address at 7pm and opposition parties await the first Sona addressed by him. Chief whip of the Democratic Alliance, John Steenhuisen says they are looking forward to the post Zuma era because they will be able to move back to debating about policies, ideas and making sure that they are putting South Africans first again. “We are looking forward to moving beyond the personality politics, Mr Zuma sucked all the oxygen out of Parliament and that has been a great cost to the country because we haven’t been able to debate about the issues of the country, the economy and how we will get the 9 million unemployed people back to work.” Click below to watch full interview:  Meanwhile Chairperson of the NCOP Thandi Modise says she is feeling relieved, optimistic and positive about the political environment in the country and the Sona.
