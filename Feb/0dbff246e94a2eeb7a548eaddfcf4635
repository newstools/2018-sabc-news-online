Mozambican authorities say 16 people have been killed, many others injured and seven houses damaged in the capital Maputo. This comes after an incident in which a 15-metre pile of garbage collapsed due to heavy rains. According to reports, the collapse occurred in the early hours of Monday in the impoverished Hulene neighbourhood, which is about ten kilometres from the centre of capital Maputo. Television Mozambique journalist Emmanuel Langa says the victims had built their houses around the dumping site. “Sixteen people died because of this situation, and 62 families have displaced… they can no longer stay in the same place, they have moved to another place. There are other members of government who are still working to see what would happen in the place, there were many people living in the dumping site and that place is really not safe. No information about people missing or not – but there are 16 dead  that’s the official number we were given by the government.” About Motsebi Monareng View all posts by Motsebi Monareng
