The Judgement on a bail application by Cornerstone International Ministry Church Bishop Dingaan David Selabe and his co- accused Boikanyo Justice Selabe is expected to be handed down on Friday at the Molopo Magistrates Court in Mahikeng. The cleric and his co-accused were arrested by the Hawks for allegedly defrauding a woman by getting her to pay them money in exchange for a non-existing housing project tender. Selabe and his co-accused asked the victim to pay approximately R1.8 million in total into his banking account. Selabe is also facing several separate charges of fraud and corruption, who together with other accomplices allegedly defrauded his victims of millions of rands since 2014, in Klerksdorp and Mafikeng towns. Last week while appearing on the above charges Selabe allegedly assaulted and intimidated a photographer of the Sowetan newspaper Tiro Ramatlhatse. Both cases have been postponed to the 5th and 27th of February respectively. About SABC View all posts by SABC
