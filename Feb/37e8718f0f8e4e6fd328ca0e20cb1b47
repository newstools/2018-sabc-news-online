The EFF says it will table a motion of no confidence in Nelson Mandela Bay Mayor Athol Trollip, as a warning to the Democratic Alliance over its stance on land expropriation without compensation. This follows DA leader Mmusi Maimane’s comments in last week’s state of the nation debate that expropriation of land without compensation is incompatible with a growing economy. EFF leader Julius Malema was speaking during a debate after tabling the motion of land without compensation in Parliament on Tuesday. Malema says, “On April 6‚ the day of Jan van Riebeecks’ arrival‚ the day of the formation of the PAC by Sobukwe and the hanging of Solomon Mahlangu, in honour of these people and also as a demonstration of the seriousness about this issue of land‚ we will be passing a motion of no confidence in the mayor as a warning shot to the DA.”   About SABC Radio View all posts by SABC Radio
