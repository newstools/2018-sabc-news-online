African National Congress Chief Whip Jackson Mthembu says the governing party has renewed its efforts to address inequalities in the country. He was speaking in the National Assembly during the debate of both houses of Parliament on President Cyril Ramaphosa’s State-of-the-Nation-Address (SONA). In his maiden SONA, Ramaphosa took a clear, firm stance on his plans to end corruption at state institutions and state-owned enterprises as well as the private sector. Ramaphosa will reply to the debate on Tuesday. Mthembu says the ANC needs to honour the dreams of the late former president, Nelson Mandela. “This year as we celebrate the centenary of the birth of utata Nelson Mandela our icon, we shall intensify our efforts to realise his vision of a united SA in which all, even this with equal rights and opportunities, we shall renew our focus on comrade Mandela’s vision of a non-racial society in which the social and economic barriers that have separated black from white are broken down.” Watch below:  About SABC View all posts by SABC
