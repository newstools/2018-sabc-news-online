The case of former Western Cape Police commissioner, Arno Lamoer and four co-accused has resumed in the High Court in Cape Town. Last week, Lamoer and co-accused, Brigadiers Darius van der Ross, Colin Govender and businessman Salim Dawjee pleaded guilty to fraud and corruption dating back to 2013. Govenderâ€™s wife, Sharon, who has also been implicated, has pleaded not guilty to the charges against her. Dawjee says he gave Lamoer and his family about R67 000 between 2011 and 2013 in exchange for special favours. About Lynne Arendse View all posts by Lynne Arendse
