Police Minister Fikile Mbalula says at least 17 dockets have been opened related to the State Capture investigations. He says while the Police Ministry is unable to give a blow by blow account of the probe, investigations are taking place without fear or favour. The Hawks, together with the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) have confirmed that eight suspects have so far been arrested during raids in Johannesburg and Bloemfontein, relating to the Vrede Dairy Project. The Hawks and NPA are also working together in the so-called ‘State of Capture’ investigations commenced to serve warrants of arrests on thirteen suspects on Thursday. A total of eight suspects have been arrested during the take down operation; of which two of the suspects are still being sort while three are believed to be outside the republic and assistance on them will be sort. Minister of Police, Fikile Mbalula has directed the Acting-Head of Hawks to make sure that all ten appear before court on Thursday. The Hawks will soon be naming the two suspects still being sort locally. The Hawks assisted by the National Intervention Unit of the SAPS effected the arrests on some of the implicated suspects while others handed themselves over. Mbalula says the investigations are still continuing and more arrests cannot be ruled out. “I must appreciate the patience of the public in general for allowing the law enforcement agencies to do their work; these investigations naturally take a lot of time.” “Due to the sensitivity and seriousness of these matters it is not possible for the Hawks or my office to provide minute to minute account of the state of capture related investigations but once again assure all that since mid-2017 at least 17 dockets are being investigated without fear or favour and indeed with no holy-cows,” says Mbalula.
