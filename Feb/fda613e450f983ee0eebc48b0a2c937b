South African Communist Party (SACP) General Secretary Blade Nzimande says the party is against the 1% VAT increase because it is intended to recover billions of rand stolen and taken to Dubai. Nzimande was speaking at the funeral service of MKMVA national deputy chairperson and SACP provincial leader in Limpopo, Leka “teenage” Monama in Modimolle, Limpopo. Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba announced the VAT hike in his budget speech which focused on stabilising the fiscus. Nzimande says VAT will continue to increase as long as taps remain open for state capture. “We are against the increase of VAT because we are increasing VAT because money billions of rand have been stolen they are in Dubai and we are suppose subside that by the workers and the poor by paying one percent more VAT the VAT is going to increase as long as this tap remain open we need to fight this state capture.” Meanwhile, African National Congress (ANC) provincial chair and Limpopo premier Stan Mathabatha says Leka “Teenage” Monama died with integrity, although they were many attempts to destroy him. Mathabatha says Monama was a good comrade. “He was a good comrade there were so many attempt to destroy him but they couldn’t succeed until today he dies with integrity was among the best which this revolution  has ever produced like Moses Kotane this is one comrade who was incorruptible.”  About Michael Makungo View all posts by Michael Makungo
