The Democratic Alliance has welcomed President Cyril Ramaphosa‘s decision to withdraw his predecessor Jacob Zuma‘s  appeal over the appointment of a National Prosecuting Authority head. Zuma appealed against a Pretoria high court judgment that found that he was too conflicted to appoint a new NPA head. It came after the court nullified NPA head Shaun Abraham’s appointment and also ruled that a new head should be appointed by the deputy President. DA Federal Executive Chairperson James Selfe says Zuma will now have his day in court. “The Democratic Alliance is delighted that the appeal is withdrawn. There should have never been an appeal. This should now allow the former president to have his day in court that he has always wanted. And we are absolutely certain that when the truth is finally told, we will be in a position to know exactly what went on during this terrible ear in our history.” The Economic Freedom Fighters have also welcomed Ramaphosa’s decision to withdraw the appeal. EFF Spokesperson Mbuyiseni Ndlozi says it’s now time to appoint a new NPA head. “It’s a welcoming development and what should follow now is that Abrahams should step down to save all of us time so that the new head of the NPA can be appointed.”  About Mercedes Besent View all posts by Mercedes Besent
