Some areas of the Eastern Cape have received good rains over the past two days. However, it is still not enough to break the drought. Grahamstown recorded about 42.2 millimetres of rain Wednesday night. Meanwhile, some catchment areas in the Kouga Municipality such as Patensie recorded about 10 millimetres of rain. Garth Simpson from the Port Elizabeth weather office elaborates, “In the catchment areas in the past two days it was roughly 10 mm, unfortunately while it will put some in-flowing into the dams it is not enough to break any drought or to make any significant rise in the dam levels. If we look at the outlooks of the coming months, the season forecast ends in June, and we are not looking at anything above normal above then.” About Olwethu Matsipane View all posts by Olwethu Matsipane
