African People’s Convention (APC) Leader Themba Godi says he has declined an invitation by opposition parties to attend a meeting to discuss the removal of President Jacob Zuma. Most or all of the other opposition parties, including the Democratic Alliance (DA) and Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), are expected to attend the meeting scheduled for Monday at Parliament. In a statement, Godi says the APC believes that the political responsibility to remove President Zuma lies with his party, the ANC. Godi says, “The APC therefore is not prepared to do the ANC political responsibility on their deployed.  In our electoral system the people vote for a party, which then deploys its leader. If there is failure, it is the party that must bear ultimate responsibility.” He further says they are aware that there is a proposed motion of No confidence scheduled for the February 22, 2018. “We think that is the appropriate platform for opposition parties to act constitutionally,” He says the APC will take no side in the tensions within the ruling party.
