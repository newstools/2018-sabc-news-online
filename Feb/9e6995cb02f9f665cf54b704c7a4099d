The National Department of Health says the” Integrated School Health Programme” does not include pregnancy tests and injecting female learners with contraceptives. This is in reaction to recent allegations that a group of female Grade 12 learners at a school near Vryburg in North West were injected with contraceptives against their will late last month. The Provincial Health Department says injecting the learners is part of the national programme. However, National Deputy Director of Integrated School Health, Feni Motshwane, disagrees. “It does not have the program of going to schools to check learners for pregnancy and for contraceptives.  We also heard from the media – at this stage, we are consulting with the Province with regards to this issue, because the national policy it does not cater for that, currently it still talks to providing health information with regards to sexual reproductive health services and rights.”   About Sisi Segalo View all posts by Sisi Segalo
