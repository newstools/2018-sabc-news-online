The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) in Parliament has extended the deadline for National Assembly Speaker Baleka Mbete to make a decision to re- schedule a motion of No Confidence in President Jacob Zuma. However, the Speaker still has to contact the ANC Chief Whip Jackson Mthembu and the Deputy President to consider the EFF’s request. EFF Spokesperson Mbuyiseni Ndlozi says the party wants the No Confidence motion to be debated this week. Ndlozi says the EFF has given Mbete another three hours to make a final decision. “She has said that she will consult with the chief whip and the leader of government business only today. As a result we have extended our deadline from 10 o clock to 13H00 hours, that is One O’clock this afternoon and her failure to schedule the motion of No Confidence, we will approach the courts in the Western Cape to compel her to concede.”  About Mercedes Besent View all posts by Mercedes Besent
