Gauteng Premier David Makhura plans to appoint a health curator to fully implement the outcome of the recently held four month arbitration hearings into the Life Esidimeni tragedy. The leaders joined families of the Life Esidimeni victims in a healing ceremony at Freedom Park in Pretoria. 144 Psychiatric patients died when they were moved from Life Esidimeni to unlicenced and ill equipped facilities in 2016. The Premier also plans a remembrance monument for the victims. Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi says they are now considering prosecuting those responsible for the Esidimeni deaths. “Our journey hasn’t come to an end. We are still going to give an inquests. People don’t just die and it ends there. We need to find out how people died. There are still going to be prosecutions if the NPA deems so fit.” The ceremony wrapped up with a bell of hope and a promise to the nation that such a tragedy will never happen again.
