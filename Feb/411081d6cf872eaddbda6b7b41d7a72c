The families of the five policemen who died in a hail of bullets in Ngcobo police station in the Eastern Cape last Wednesday have described the loss of their loved ones as a huge blow to them. They were speaking after a memorial service on Tuesday in memory of the police officers. The memorial which was addressed by newly appointed Police Minister Bheki Cele was attended by locals,members of various political parties, traditional leaders and the religious fraternity. A family member of one of the officers says the messages received at the memorial service have been supportive. He says receiving the news of their son’s death was a huge shock and totally unexpected. He says: “We are so devastated. Our culture says we are the ones who are supposed to be buried by our children and not the other way around.” “Government must bring back the death penalty,” adds the family member.
