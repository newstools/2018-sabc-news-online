The Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (AMCU) have called for a Mine Safety Summit after another mineworker was killed at one of Sibanye-Stillwater’s operations. AMCU says it has received reports that a worker was electrocuted at Sibanye-Stillwater’s Driefontein Operations outside Carletonville on Gauteng’s West Rand. The union says it is the fourth fatality this month after a worker was crushed by a box of gold ore at the same operations last week. Another incident happened earlier at Sibanye-Stillwater’s Beatrix Operations in the Free State, where more than a thousand workers were trapped due to a power failure. “When we look at the stats and the trend in the manner which these mines are killing workers, surely if it continues with the pace that is in right now I think will end up having no workers who will be going underground.” “Therefore it’s proper for us to call the CEOs the curtails of this industry to sit down and engage regarding what measurement or prevention measures are they going to take to prevent more loss of life in these mines,” says AMCU president, Joseph Mathunjwa.
