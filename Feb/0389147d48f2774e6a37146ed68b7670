After 10 years of dedication towards inspiring a young, new generation of engineers, scientists and mathematicians, the Bloodhound Project has inspired a supersonic car that will cover 1.6 kilometres in 3.6 seconds and it will be doing this at the Hakskeen Pan in South Africa in September. Director of the Bloodhound Project, Richard Noble says the whole project was done to create a new generation of scientists and engineers. “At that stage, a lot of kids in Britain didn’t want to be scientists and engineers – so the whole idea was to inspire them, share data and share the whole experience with them. It is enormous now, in 2016 we had 129 000 kids which is massive and what we bringing with it is not only the car but the education system as well.”  Click below to watch full interview:  About Morning Live View all posts by Morning Live
