Jacob Zuma has officially resigned from his position as the State President of South Africa. Addressing the nation on Wednesday evening, Zuma has said that while he felt compelled to resign, he remains committed to, and will continue to serve the ANC. His address comes after the African National Congress National Executive Committee affirmed its decision to recall him. Earlier on Wednesday, ANC Treasurer General Paul Mashatile told the media in Parliament that they would table a motion of no confidence in Zuma on Thursday should he not resign as Head of State by the end of Wednesday. Speaking in an interview with the SABC, Zuma later accused the NEC of treating him unfairly by not giving him reasons for his recall. This follows mounting pressure from internal structures of the ANC and opposition parties calling him to step down. The new President is expected to be announced by Friday with the State of the Nation Address now scheduled forÂ  the evening of the same day.  Click video below:  About SABC View all posts by SABC
