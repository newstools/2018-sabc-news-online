The National Assembly is on Tuesday, expected to debate an Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) motion calling for the Expropriation of Land without compensation. This is just one of the activities in parliament this week. Various condolence motions for former anti-apartheid activist Laloo Chiba and Beatrice Ncgobo will take place on Thursday. The EFF wants the National Assembly to pass a resolution to allow the expropriation of land without compensation. The debate will be led by EFF leader Julius Malema. It will be the second time the EFF brings such a motion. The debate will take place just eleven days after President Cyril Ramaphosa announced in his State of the Nation Address (Sona) that government will expropriate land without compensation. It requires two thirds majority for such a motion to be successful to amend section 25 of the Constitution. Meanwhile, in other developments â€“ Parliament says Police Minister Fikile Mbalula will make a statement in the National Assembly on Wednesday, to highlight the increase in police killings by focusing on Ngcobo in the Eastern Cape. Public hearings on the budget will also start this week.   About Mercedes Besent View all posts by Mercedes Besent
