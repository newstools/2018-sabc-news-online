Economist George Glynos says Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba will have to explain how South Africa will plug a R50.8 billion hole in the country’s finances when he delivers the budget on  Wednesday. Glynos also says the extent to which Gigaba will strive to balance the budget could determine whether President Cyril Ramaphosa will retain him as Finance Minister. There have been calls for Gigaba’s removal following allegations that he’s linked to state capture. Glynos says, “There’s a lot of work to be done regarding SOE’s and the operation of government. Malusi Gigaba has got one hell of a job to do and the extent to which he delivers tomorrow, might give us some sense as to whether he will remain Finance Minister or whether he goes.” About SABC View all posts by SABC
