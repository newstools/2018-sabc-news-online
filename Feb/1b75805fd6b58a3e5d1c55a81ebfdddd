Mbalula also lashed out at former President Jacob Zuma saying unlike him, he will not cling to power despite the circumstances against him. He said he is willing to serve the people of South Africa at the request of the ANC and President Cyril Ramaphosa. These utterances come after speculation of a cabinet reshuffle.
