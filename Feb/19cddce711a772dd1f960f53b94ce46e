The Maputo Municipality in Mozambique says the evacuation process of relocating the people who reside at Huleni continues. This after heavy rains triggered the partial collapse of a huge mound of garbage killing 16 people and leaving many injured at a rubbish dump, 10 kilometers from Maputo city. The people of Mozambique are still shocked, seven children were among the victims after piles of garbage collapsed on houses in the impoverished area. Media reports indicate that the rubbish was as high as a three-story building. Marcos Hlatshwayo says he survived the incident; however his friend was not so lucky. Authorities say the collapse was caused by the heavy downpour. About two-hundred and fifty people have been evacuated to a refuge centre for their safety. The Director for Water and Sanitation for Maputo Municipality, Mucavele Joao, says they are working around the clock to help the affected families. Joao says the municipality is currently consolidating the number of the households that were affected. The weather services have predicted more rains in Mozambique in the coming days.
