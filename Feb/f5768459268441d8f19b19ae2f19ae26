Amnesty International has called on President Jacob Zuma’s successor to address human rights as violations of these were a regular event under the former president. “During Jacob Zuma’s presidency South Africa was blighted by serious human rights violations. His successor must do everything within his or her power to ensure that the state redresses this as a priority,” says Executive Director of Amnesty International South Africa, Shenilla Mohamed. “Under Jacob Zuma’s leadership, we’ve seen a failure to ensure access to justice for victims of a range of human rights violations. For example, almost six years after 34 striking mineworkers in Marikana were killed by police, there has been no justice for victims or their families,” Mohamed adds. Zuma,who was recalled by the ruling African National Congress (ANC), resigned late Wednesday. The rights activist further claimed that under the former president intimidation of independent journalists exposing corruption and “state capture” had risen. “Journalists who stood up for editorial integrity at the public broadcaster, South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC), were also harassed and intimidated,” said Mohamed. “With a new president, the ANC-led government now has a golden opportunity to ensure that human rights violations, including those from the Zuma-era, are tackled decisively and transparently.” Click below to watch video:  About ANA View all posts by ANA
