A 32 year-old man has been sentenced to 20 years imprisonment by the Nongoma regional court for rape and murder. KwaZulu Natal police spokesperson Nqobile Gwala says the man attacked a 24 year-old woman, raped her and slit her throat at KwaNongoma north of the province. Gwala says the man fled the area, but was later arrested after an intensive search. “Last year on the 1st of January 2017 where the victim Ntombizethu Simelane who was 24 years was at her house at Ekubuseni area in Nongoma when the accused approached her, after an argument then the accused raped the victim, slit her throat and the victim was found lying in the pool of blood inside the house. Nongoma detectives started their investigation and the accused was then traced and arrested. A murder weapon was also confiscated by the police,” says Gwala.
