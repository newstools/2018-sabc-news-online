Some land claimants at Mooketsi outside Modjadjiskloof in Limpopo have asked the Land Claims Commission to speed up the finalisation of their claim to ensure that they get access to their ancestral land. The Bakgaga-Ba-Maupa’s claim on farms in and around Mooketsi was gazetted in May 2002. Most of the farms are currently owned and used by tomato-producer, ZZ-2. Some of the claimants have been staying in shacks on portions of the claimed land. The claimants’ chief, Ephraim Seabi says they are living in dire conditions without electricity and sanitation. Seabi says the delay by the commission is making the situation worse. “The commission was not well set because it says to me the land is restored but nothing is happening. After 2009 which is 9 years late, the land was restored coming with different stories, some now have cut my land in pieces.” Watch related video:
