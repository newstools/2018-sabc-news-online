 At least three people have been killed in an attack on a religious ceremony in the Indian state of Punjab. Several others were wounded in the attack when a hand grenade was thrown at a gathering of members of the Nirankari religious group in Amritsar. The BBC’s Electra Naysmith has the details. “Reports say two masked men on a motorbike brandished a gun before forcing their way in and throwing a grenade. Several of the injured are in a critical condition. The attack comes ahead of a major Sikh festival on Friday. Sikhs dominate in Punjab and are at odds with the Nirankari, a spiritual sect they consider to be heretics,” explains Naysmith.
