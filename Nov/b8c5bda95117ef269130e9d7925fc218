Democratic Alliance (DA ) leader, Mmusi Maimane, denies there is racism within the DA.  Maimane is visiting the Northern Cape as part of a countrywide launch of the party’s team one SA campaign. Maimane refused to comment on fraud charges laid against senior DA members by former Cape Town mayor, Patricia de Lille, earlier this week. When asked about recent allegations of racism made by DA members, Maimane had this to say: “South Africa has a history of divisions. I reject anybody who proposes that. Ultimately ours is a party for all the people when you look out here, you see South Africans from different walks of life. You can see that the dream of Nelson Mandela only lives in the DA and nowhere else,” says Maimane.
