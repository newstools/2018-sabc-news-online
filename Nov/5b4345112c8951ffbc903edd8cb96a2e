Businessman and property mogul Jason Rohde has been found guilty of the murder of his wife Susan. Judgment was handed down by the Western Cape High Court on Thursday. Judge Gayaat Salie-Hlophe says the Spier hotel was the crime scene of a love triangle which had formed months before the murder in July 2016. She noted that Jason Rohde had testified in his defence with studied precision saying he was not a credible witness. He has also been found guilty on a charge of defeating the ends of justice. The presiding Judge says the evidence proved beyond reasonable doubt that Jason Rohde murdered his wife and then staged her death as a suicide. Click below for more:
