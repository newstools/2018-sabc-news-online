The Supreme Court of Appeal in Bloemfontein is expected to hear an appeal over the VhaVenda crown Friday morning. Princess Masindi Mphephu and her uncle, King Toni Mphephu-Ramabulana, have been at loggerheads over the crown for six years. Princess Masindi wants the Society for Creative Anachronism (SCA) to nullify the customary law rule of male primogeniture in traditional leadership. In September 2016, the princess successfully got the court to halt former president Jacob Zuma’s plans to crown the king, pending the finality of the current legal stand-off. However, the king contends that the appellant has never lodged any dispute with the former Commission on Traditional Leadership Disputes and Claims… In papers before the Appeal Court, Princess Masindi Mphephu says former President Jacob Zuma did not consider the existing customary law when he applied the rule of male primogeniture. This led to the recognition of Toni Mphephu-Ramabulana as the rightful VhaVenda king. Princess Masindi Mphephu is the daughter of the late VhaVenda chief, Tshimangadzo Dimbanyika Mphephu. Tshimangadzo Mphephu had reigned from 1994 until he died in a car crash in December 1997. Watch related video:
