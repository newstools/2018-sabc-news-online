Cosatu says it is concerned that there’s no job security in South Africa as many companies are considering retrenchments. The labour federation has taken its concerns to the streets of Pietermaritzburg in KwaZulu-Natal. The march is also against the looming retrenchments at the SABC and Eskom. The union will hand a memorandum to premier Willies Mchunu and officials of the Labour Department. Provincial secretary Edwin Mkhize says, “I’ve seen in most of the sectors such as SABC the Eskom we are told that the mining as well the retrenchments that we see in companies is retrenchments that will affect all workers whether you are in the public or private sector. We are saying that in South Africa there is no longer what you call job security. Workers are not protected many, people are being retrenched. We are saying as Cosatu, we need to be on the street and defend our members, hence we are having this particular March”
