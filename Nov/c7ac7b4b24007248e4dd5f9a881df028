The corruption case against former president Jacob Zuma and co-accused French arms company Thale has been postponed in the High Court in Pietermaritzburg to May 2019.  The aim of the postponement is to allow the state to file responding papers. Both Zuma and Thales have filed an application for a permanent stay of prosecution. Zuma’s lawyer also said that the former president was not feeling well. Earlier hundred of supporters surrounded the court precinct with security heightened. Among them were former North West ANC provincial chairperson, Supra Mahumapelo and former Cosatu president and ANC NEC member, Sdumo Dlamini. Zuma wants the charges against him which include fraud, racketeering and money laundering to be quashed saying they have dragged on for 14 years. They emanate from the multi-billion arms procurement. In his court papers Zuma says he has faced public and media prosecution which he claims has been engineered by the National Prosecuting Authority.
