The memorial service of former Robben Island political prisoner and former African National Congress (ANC) Councillor in the City of Cape Town, Danile Landingwe, will be held at the Gugulethu Sports Complex on Tuesday afternoon. Landingwe passed away last week at the age of 71. ANC NEC member Mcebisi Skwatsha who worked closely with Landingwe says he was committed to the struggle for a free South Africa. “He’s one of the people we hold in high regard in the area of Gugulethu. He was an inspiration to us younger ones who grew up later after him. This is an unimaginable loss for our country, and Gugulethu in particular. Landingwe was someone who was active in everything.”
