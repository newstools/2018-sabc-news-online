Political analyst Tinyiko Maluleke says South Africans are waiting to see whether former Cape Town mayor Patricia de Lille will manage to raise sufficient funds to embark on a credible campaign ahead of the 2019 general elections. De Lille announced that she would start a new party which would contest next year’s general elections in all provinces in the country. She resigned as mayor and member of the Democratic Alliance (DA) last month after a long battle with the party’s leadership. Maluleke says, “What I think we are waiting for is to see whether she will have feet on the ground, whether she will have foot soldiers, whether she will have the money that is necessary to mount a campaign that is credible but we’ll have to wait and see, not just in the Western Cape but she says wants to compete across the land.
