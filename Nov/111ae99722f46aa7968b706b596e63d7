The National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) says Eskom cannot consider retrenching employees without first consulting unions. Eskom announced this week that it’s to start legal processes to cut staff, but only at executive management level.   Eskom is facing financial difficulties – with falling sales and an inability to meet debt obligations. The NUM’s Youth Structure’s National Secretary, Bonginkosi Mrasi, says cutting jobs is not a step in the right direction.   “It is going to start with the senior managers and goes down to the power stations. But we also have members in senior management, so we are saying although it affects senior managers we must be consulted on that so [that] we can bring mechanisms in place to assist with the situation.” “Losing jobs cannot be a step in the right direction because we are saying let a worker go home without any food to put on the table. We are saying, let us be consulted, bring ideas to save the utility – like how to save costs, let us stop purchasing the IPPs,” adds Mrasi.
