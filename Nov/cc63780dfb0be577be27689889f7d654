President Cyril Ramaphosa will address the National Council of Provinces (NCOP) in Ekurhuleni, east of Johannesburg, on Thursday. The week-long “Taking Parliament to the People” programme started on Monday in the province with public participation. Residents have raised issues relating to housing, health, education and crime. The National Council of Provinces launched its “Taking Parliament to the People” in 2002 to give communities first-hand experience of how Parliamentary procedures work and to demonstrate accountability in action. These NCOP visits are rotational and this year the focus is in Gauteng. The 2018 session is taking place under the theme – Seizing the moment to chat a new course of action against poverty, unemployment, inequality and underdevelopment. President Ramaphosa will have an opportunity to answer some of the concerns raised by communities.
