The Science and Technology Department says South Africa is producing scientists who can enhance research into the future. This as the country celebrates 10 years of nuclear research and being part of the European Organisation for Nuclear Research, CERN. A three-day event to celebrate the collaboration is underway at the iThemba Laboratory near Faure outside Cape Town. Senior Researcher at iThemba Labs Dr Zinhle Buthelezi says, although science students have been able to break the frontiers of nuclear research, a lot needs to be done to attract more scientists. CERN was founded in 1954 and is located in Geneva, Switzerland. It is known for major scientific breakthroughs such as the discovery of the Higgs-Bason particle in 2012. Buthelezi says iThemba has established a strong footprint in fundamental physics at the international facility. There are currently 80 students working in the research programme.
