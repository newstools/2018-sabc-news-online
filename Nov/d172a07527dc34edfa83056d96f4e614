African National Congress (ANC) divisions on e-tolls came to the fore during ANC Secretary-General, Ace Magashule’s visit to Qwaqwa in the Free State. He was conducting a door-to-door Thuma Mina campaign in the area. Magashule has urged South Africans to contribute to ensure government achieves its goal. Commenting on e-tolls, Magashule says motorists should contribute to help government. “The government is busy engaging on e-tolls and we hope solution can be reached. But South Africans must ensure they help government.” Despite many people seeing the Thuma Mina campaign as an election ploy, Magashule says the ANC will soon roll out its Election Campaign. On Friday thousands of African National Congress (ANC) members in Gauteng marched to the Union Buildings on, calling for the controversial e-tolling system to be scrapped before next year’s general elections. The party says e-tolls are a burden to the people of Gauteng and must be scrapped with immediate effect.  Related video click below:
