The family of Dean Jafta say they have finally found closure after they reburied the 20-year-old son who went missing last year in May. His family and friends in Eersterust, in the east of Pretoria, started with a massive search but could not find him. Earlier this month, the police admitted that Jafta’s body was found in Midrand shortly after he disappeared and was given a pauper’s burial without the police trying to identify the body. Jafta was exhumed last week and buried in Eersterus on Saturday. Three men have been arrested for Jafta’s murder and will appear in the Pretoria Magistrate’s Court on 20 November. “Partly I got closure yes, because now I am burying somebody. It is not nice for us to bury Dean in the situation we’re burying. Partial closure yes but I would also like to see the police can come up with proper information with regards to the case,” says Denzil Jafta. Watch related video below:
