Zimbabwe’s President Emmerson Mnangagwa says his government will provide whatever is necessary to support the country’s ailing former leader, Robert Mugabe. Mnangagwa confirmed on Saturday that the 94 year old Mugabe is now unable to walk owing to ill health, and that he has been receiving medical treatment in Singapore for the past two months. He also warned medical suppliers who are charging in US dollars for medication that their licences will be withdrawn. Mnangagwa was addressing hundreds of Zanu-PF supporters in Mugabe’s home area of Zvimba. “Mugabe is the founding father of the nation of Zimbabwe. He is our founding father of free Zimbabwe. The majority of you who are now selling medical provisions asking for US Dollars… it’s not proper. There is no reason why you must ask the public to purchase these drugs in foreign currencies.” “Those of you who do not heed this caution, we will withdraw your licences.” Click related video below:
