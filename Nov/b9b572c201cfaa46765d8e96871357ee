A grieving KwaZulu-Natal family wants answers from the state. This follows the murder of their son while under the witness protection programme. Forty three-year-old Bonginkosi Shoyisa was to be a key witness in the murder case of a senior municipal official from KwaNongoma in northern KwaZulu-Natal. He died under mysterious circumstances last month. His mother Nompumelelo Shoyisa is desperately seeking answers about the death of her son. “They mustn’t lie about how my son died… they killed him. I saw him, his head injury, his torso was scarred as if he had been dragged and it’s clear he died days before they said because his body was decomposed.” The post mortem report, which the SABC is in possession of, says he was hit with a blunt object in the head and his decomposed body was found in the safe house. The family believes it is a police cover-up, both the police and the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) were not available for comment. WATCH BELOW:
