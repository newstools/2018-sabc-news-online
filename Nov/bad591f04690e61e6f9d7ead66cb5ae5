Democratic Alliance (DA) leader in the Western Cape Bonginkosi Madikizela says the resignation of Cape Town mayor Patricia de Lille presents the party with time to reflect and repair the damage. De Lille publicly resigned on the steps of the Western Cape High Court, where she is applying to challenge the contents of the Bowman Gilfillan report.   The report recommends that she be criminally charged for corruption. Madikizela says allegations of racism against the party by De Lille at this point, sound like deflection.  “My issue is that people must not wait until they are held accountable before they raise these issues, because it seems as if people are deflecting the attention from the fact that they are being held accountable. I don’t want to sound like I am dismissing individual experiences within the party, but people must not wait until they are held accountable before they raise those issues,” adds Madikizela. Meanwhile, Capetonians have expressed mixed reactions after de Lille announced her resignation as the executive mayor of Cape Town on Wednesday. She has also resigned as DA member – and is expected to announce her next career move in two weeks. DA mayor elect for Cape Town, Dan Plato, will officially become a councillor on Thursday, after being confirmed by the IEC. Click related video below:
