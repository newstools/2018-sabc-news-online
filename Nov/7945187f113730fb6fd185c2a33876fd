DA MP and former State Prosecutor, Glynnis Breytenbach has withdrawn as a candidate for the position of NPA head. This comes as the panel conducting interviews is due to start with proceedings Wednesday at the Union Buildings in Pretoria. Breytenbach says her withdrawal comes after consulting her party, the Democratic Alliance. This has left eleven candidates to be considered for the position.
