Gunfire has been exchanged between security guards and suspected cash-in-transit robbers during an armed heist in Katlehong, east of Johannesburg, Saturday morning. One guard has been shot. Witnesses say a Mercedes-Benz vehicle was used to intercept the van that was transporting the money. The suspects used explosives to force the cash-in-transit van open before escaping in two bakkies.  SAPS’ National spokesperson, Vish Naidoo says, “Security guards did try to put up a fight. There was an exchange of gunfire between them and the robbers. But unfortunately they were overpowered by the robbers who came in two other bakkies.” “They were armed with rifles and machine guns. They then used explosives to gain access to the money in the vehicle and fled with an undisclosed amount of money. One security guard is reportedly wounded from the exchange of gunfire and has been taken to hospital where he is reported to be in a stable condition,” adds Naidoo.
