Communications Deputy Minister, Pinky Kekana, has welcomed the findings of the Commission of Inquiry into sexual harassment at the SABC. The independent commission, chaired by Barbara Watson, released its findings in Johannesburg on Tuesday and recommended that the public broadcaster reopen old sexual harassment cases. The report found that instead of helping employees, the human resources department seemed to have worked with perpetrators. Kekana’s spokesperson, Chrispin Phiri says the minister wants action to be taken. “She encouraged the Chair to ensure that action is taken against such individuals but she also called upon the Board Chairperson and the Board where there’s discrepancies in terms of equal pay, especially where men and women are in the same line of work, that is corrected as soon as possible to ensure that gender parity is achieved substantially.” Watch related videos:
