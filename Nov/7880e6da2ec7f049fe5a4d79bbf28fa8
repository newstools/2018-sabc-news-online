The African Independent Congress (AIC) is embroiled in a leadership dispute. Two factions – one led by Mandla Galo, and another led by Zama Ntshayisa – claim to be sole legitimate structures. The Galo-led faction has now suspended nine councillors and its Member of Parliament. Zama Ntshayisa says he is prepared to fight for the AIC leadership that was democratically elected. He says they will counter any move by the AIC under the leadership of Mandla Galo. “We are just waiting for any action from them, if they invite us to the DC hearing, we are going to do the same. If they fire us, we are going to fire them. Because the body structure that has been sent to IEC is this structure that is being led by Mr Ntshayisa. So that is the counter action that I am talking about.” One of the suspended councillors, Aubrey Mhlongo, says the latest developments have the potential of destabilizing the party ahead of 2019 General elections. “We feel very bad about what is going on currently in the AIC, although we have differences it  could be something that we could sit down and discuss and resolve them out of court, but the other faction that is led by the current president Mr Galo is not prepared to come and sit down and negotiate the settlement about this thing, hence, this is going to create a lot of damage.”
