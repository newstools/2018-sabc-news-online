The two men arrested in connection with the gruesome murder of a Vlakfontein family near Lenasia, south of Johannesburg, are on Wednesday expected to apply for bail in the Lenasia Magistrate’s Court. Twenty seven-year-old Ernest Mabaso and 61 year-year-old Fifita Khupe are facing seven counts of murder in connection with the murder of seven relatives last month. Mabaso is facing three additional rape charges. The applications were due to be heard on Tuesday however the case had to be postponed due to a power outage in court. “The building experienced electrical problems due to a faulty cable that was detected by a technician on site and the technician is working together with his team to resolve the problem so that the bail application can be heard on Wednesday,” said National Prosecutions Authority (NPA) spokesperson Phindi Mjonondwana.
