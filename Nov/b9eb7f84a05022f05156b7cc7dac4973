The North Gauteng High Court in Pretoria has instructed the panel to conduct its interviews for the National Director of Public Prosecution post in public. This follows the Right2Know (R2K) group’s successful court application challenging the previous decision by President Cyril Ramaphosa’s office to hold the interviews in secret.   Right2Know access to information organiser, Mluleki Marongo says they wanted the interviews for the new National Director of Public Prosecutions (NDPP), to be conducted in the open with the media present. He says the judgment came at the right time when the candidates will be sitting for interviews for the position of NDPP from Wednesday. “We are very happy about the ruling. Firstly, it strengthens the case on openness and transparency in our democracy. Secondly, it gives us and takes us a step further in defining or in understanding the curtailment on the President Powers. So we are very happy about this,” adds Maronga.
