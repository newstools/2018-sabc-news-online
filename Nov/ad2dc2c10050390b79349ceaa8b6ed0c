The case of two officers from the Sophiatown police station in Johannesburg arrested in connection with the murder of a Westbury man is expected to resume in the Johannesburg Magistrate’s Court on Thursday. Warrant officer Wynanad Steyn and Sergeant Tom Keet, along with seven others, are accused of killing 21 year-old Bradley Sauls in Westbury in August. The suspects are facing a string of charges including murder, conspiracy to commit murder and kidnapping. Police officers Steyn and Keet will continue applying for bail without their seven co-accused. During their previous court appearance, the two officers’ bail applications could not be concluded because the state had not fully prepared for the case. The prosecution indicated it needed more time to prepare as they were only given the affidavits on the day of the bail hearing. Meanwhile, the other seven accused have all abandoned their bail applications and their case will be heard on December 7, 2018.
