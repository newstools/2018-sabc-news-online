The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) says lobby group Afriforum’s court application shows that it’s confused about the difference between public consultation and a referendum. EFF Spokesperson Mbuyiseni Ndlozi said if parliament wanted a quantitative outcome on amending Section 25 of the Constitution, it would have conducted a referendum for people to vote Yes or No. He said it would be unfair if Afriforum wants written submissions to outweigh public hearings that took place in the town halls across the country. “Not everyone in the town halls was able to participate during the hearings and not everyone who could not participate has access to internet to alternatively make written submissions,” said Ndlozi.
