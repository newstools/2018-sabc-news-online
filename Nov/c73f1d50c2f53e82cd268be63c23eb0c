The City of Ekurhuleni is adamant that it is not in any way contributing to the pollution of the Vaal River system. City officials from the Department of Water and Sanitation are making oral submissions on the second day of the inquiry into the sewage pollution of the Vaal River. It is being held by the South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) in Johannesburg. A number of rivers in Ekurhuleni, east of Johannesburg, flow into the Vaal River. It is estimated that about 150 megalitres of raw sewage pours into the river on a daily basis. “The second day of the inquiry has kicked off with the City of Ekhurhuleni claiming that it is in no way party to the sewage contamination of the Vaal River system. Mbali Matiwane, the Head of Water Quality in the City, says they have stringent quality measures in place. She told the panel that inspectors also conduct regular site visits at industries operating in the City to ensure that they comply with rules and regulations. Matiwane added that plans are afoot for a full upgrade of all the waste water plants and sewage systems in the city.” Watch related video below:
