An ex-president of Madagascar and the man who overthrew him in a 2009 coup will compete to become the island state’s next leader in a run-off election in December after the two came top in a first-round vote that eliminated the incumbent. Former President Marc Ravalomanana garnered 35.35% of the vote in the first round on November 7, behind his successor, Andry Rajoelina, who got 39.23%, the High Constitutional Court ruled on Wednesday. Incumbent President Hery Rajaonarimampianina drew just 8.82%, the court said, and will not take part in the second round, due on December 19. The court rejected his request for the vote to be cancelled and Rajoelina’s votes invalidated, saying there was insufficient evidence of widespread irregularities. Rajoelina told reporters after the court’s announcement of results. “I appeal to all citizens, to those who did not vote, it is not too late. The time to save Madagascar has come. Vote in the next election. I reach out to those who are not yet convinced. Take my hand.”
