The Special Investigating Unit (SIU) Head, Andy Mothibi, says the SIU will join the SABC in its civil litigation against Lorna Vision and former Acting Chief Executive Officer (CEO) James Aguma. Over R60 million is being recovered from Aguma and Lorna Vision. Mothibi has told Parliament that the contract that was entered into by Aguma and Lorna Vision relates to the collection of TV license fees by the company. “This contract has been set aside by the High Court and on the 11th of May, the SIU submitted evidence to the SABC attorneys in support of a civil claim against Aguma and Lorna Vision to recover the R62.7 million. SABC has issued summons against both parties and the SIU has filed an application to join the proceedings,” says Mothibi.
