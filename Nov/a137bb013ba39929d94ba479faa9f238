Parliament’s Standing Committee on Public Accounts (SCOPA) says the SABC board has not provided enough evidence of consequence management for those who allegedly engage in fruitless and wasteful expenditure. This after the SABC Board appeared before the Communications Committee this week, indicating that the public broadcaster faces a dire financial situation which may result in staff not receiving salaries at some point early in 2019. SCOPA Chairperson, Themba Godi, says the committee believes that the SABC can find solutions, rather than resorting to retrenchments. “The issue is what is being done and we accept the current leadership is permanent and the board is also short.” “The issue is one of implementation. One of the issues we are raising is the instances of irregular expenditure and suspicious transactions. What have you done about it.” “That was the main point for us. In instances where action has been taken it’s no more than a slap on the wrist and no recovery. But on the other hand you want to retrench workers. So we are saying there are inconsistencies and a lack of demonstration of leadership and taking action.” Click video below:
