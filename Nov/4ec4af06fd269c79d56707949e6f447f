Justice and Correctional Services Minister, Michael Masutha, says much needs to be done to improve the performance and efficiency of the justice system when dealing with gender-based violence. He was speaking at the start of a two-day Gender-based Violence and Femicide summit in Pretoria. Masutha provided statistics on gender-based-violence. “I would like to share some stats from the NPA. From 2014 to date, a total of 117 811 sexual offences cases against women and children were reported. More than half of these cases were offences committed against children. An additional 115 89 cases were also reported, bringing the total number of crimes against women and children to 129 400.” President Cyril Ramaphosa is due to give the keynote address at the summit, which brings together over a thousand delegates from various sectors.
