The Public Servants Association (PSA) spokesperson Tahir Maepa has called on Public Office Bearers not to accept the 4% salary increase. Maepa says under the current economic climate in the country, President Cyril Ramaphosa and his cabinet do not deserve to get salary hikes. The Independent Commission for Remuneration of Public Office Bearers recommended that the President, Ministers, members of the judiciary and mayors, amongst others, receive a 4% salary increase. Maepa says it would be wrong for government to reward some of the ministers and municipal managers because they have bankrupted their departments and municipalities. This recommendation comes as government continues to voice its concerns about what it has been describing as an unsustainable wage bill in the public-sector which amounts to more than R587 billion. If the recommendation gets the green light, salaries of ministers would increase to R2,497,698. Ramaphosa’s salary will increase from R2,989,845 to R3,109,439 a  year, while Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng’s pay will go up from R2,825,470 to R2,938,488. The salary increases are for the 2018-2019 financial year and, if approved, would have to be back paid to April. But some people took to social media to criticise the move.
