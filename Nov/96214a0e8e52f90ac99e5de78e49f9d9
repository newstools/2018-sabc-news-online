Democratic Alliance leader, Mmusi Maimane has applied for access to a contract between the African Global Group, formerly known as Bosasa and President Cyril Ramaphosa’s son, Andile. Earlier this week the opposition party questioned President Ramaphosa about an alleged payment of half a million rand made to his son by the CEO of the Group, Gavin Watson. President Ramaphosa has confirmed knowledge of the payment as a fee for consulting services, but was later contradicted when Andile denied receiving the alleged payment at all. “This is obviously a clear contradiction and we need to find out who is lying here. If there is a contract, we would like to see this contract and the people of South Africa would need to see what it entails. To ensure then that Mr Ramaphosa and his family are not receiving kick-backs from controversial companies that are doing business with the state and ANC politicians” says Maimane’s Deputy Chief of staff, Graham Charters.
