Residents of the Buffalo City Metro in the Eastern Cape say they’ve now been without water and electricity for the past five days, due to a municipal workers’ strike. Services in East London and surrounding areas are affected because the workers are striking over unpaid monies related to job evaluations. It’s also alleged that striking workers have damaged a power station in King Williams Town, resulting in a number of businesses operating without power. These residents are calling on the municipality to resolve the matter urgently: “It’s been days without water, it’s been days without electricity. Healthwise, we are at risk because there are rubbish dumps everywhere, our kids are not safe. The municipality rates are too high for us to be going through this and experiencing this.” “I feel like the BCM Municipality is not respecting us as residents because we don’t have electricity, we don’t have water in our areas and we are struggling with our day to day lives.”
