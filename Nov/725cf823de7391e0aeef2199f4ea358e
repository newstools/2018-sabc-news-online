Security of state hospitals is under the spotlight after health professionals were attacked by armed men while asleep. Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi wants a review of security at public hospitals. This follows the shooting of two doctors by an armed gang at Limpopo’s Letaba hospital. Motsoaledi and Police Minister Bheki Cele visited the injured doctors at the hospital. The presence and role of private security is now being questioned. It’s alleged the guards on duty fled when the doctors were attacked. Motsoaledi says, “On the night of the incident, there were 23 security officers.” Police Minister Bheki Cele says, “Hospitals cannot be turned into killing fields, and police would not allow the attack on health officials.” The doctors are still recuperating in the intensive care unit.
