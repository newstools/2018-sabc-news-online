Deputy Finance Minister Mondli Gungubele has come out in defence of Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan. Gungubele started his closing speech on the 2018 Special Appropriation Bill by addressing allegations of corruption against Gordhan by the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF). The party protested outside the Zondo Commission of Inquiry into state capture last week, while Gordhan was giving evidence. The party has also laid criminal charges against the minister on allegations of money laundering, corruption, and contravention of the Intelligence Act, among others. Gungubele says they have full confidence in Gordhan, “To us Pravin Gordhan is a time tested leader who’s led us for years, during the most adverse times. He passed the test. So we’ll not be misled by kids with smoke evidence. They must come something with concrete. No stories.” Watch related videos
