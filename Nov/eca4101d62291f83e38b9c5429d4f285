Former GCIS head Mzwanele Manyi is expected to wrap up his testimony at the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture on Tuesday. On Monday, Manyi defended the use of the Gupta owned, The New Age, newspaper by government. He also continued to dismiss current acting GCIS CEO Phumla Williams’ evidence. Evidence leader Vincent Maleka is expected to probe further Manyi’s testimony. Tension filled the room at the commission on Monday, when Manyi wouldn’t answer questions directly, forcing the intervention of Chairperson Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo. Manyi heavily criticised the testimonies of some of the witnesses saying none have brought any evidence to corroborate their statements.The African National Congress (ANC), led by chairperson Gwede Mantashe, will also take the stand.
