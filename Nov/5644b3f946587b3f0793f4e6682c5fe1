Eleven suspects arrested in connection with a cash-in-transit heist in Mahikeng in the North West are expected to apply for bail in the Molopo Magistrate’s Court on Wednesday morning. Qolile Qoma and ten alleged accomplices were arrested two months ago.  This will be their fourth court appearance. Amongst those arrested are three employees from a private security company, which was ferrying cash to one of the ATMs at Itsoseng and Lichtenburg at the time of the robbery. During their arrest, only R37 000 was recovered, while the rest of the cash is reported to have been with the other suspects who are alleged to be in Gauteng. Reasons advanced by the investigating officer on the case for opposing bail, is that more arrests are imminent. Others reasons are that there is still a need to verify physical addresses for some of the suspects, and also to establish whether they are having pending cases or previous criminal records.
