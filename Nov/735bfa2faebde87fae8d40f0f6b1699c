Power utility Eskom has suspended its Executive of Group Capital Division, Abram Masango pending the investigation into various allegations of impropriety against him relating to the Kusile Power Station project. Eskom spokesperson, Khulu Phasiwe says the management took a decision following the seriousness of the allegations and the seniority of his position at the power utility. “Investigations are centering around the allegations that there are some impropriety that happened at Kusile Power Station based on the fact that he is such a senior official within Eskom and the severity of this allegations, management felt that they needed to suspend him until further notice.” The power utility has urged consumers to use energy sparingly as it faces challenges with its electricity system. The power utility says ten power stations have less than 20 days of coal stock as per grid requirement. Group Chief Executive at Eskom Phakamani Hadebe says there is a recovery plan, but load-shedding cannot be ruled out. “While the causes of this are inherent it is important for us as management of Eskom to acknowledge that some of the challenges we’re facing happened in our mist. So the outcome of all this challenge has been the increased utilisation of emergency resources such as gas. The current system therefore is not optimal, and as we move forward to try to turn around this ship, we want to highlight that we do have a recovery plan. However it’s crucial that I inform you that the load-shedding can not be ruled out.” 2Related video click below:
