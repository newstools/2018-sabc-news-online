The first National Men’s Parliament will be launched on Monday. National Assembly Deputy Speaker Lechesa Tsenoli and Deputy Minister of Social Development, Hendrietta Bogopane-Zulu, will hold a media briefing on Sunday ahead of the official launch in Parliament. According to Parliament, the National Men’s Parliament is a partnership between the institution, the Department of Social Development, the South African National AIDS Council (SANAC) and men. In a statement Parliament says, “South Africa’s first National Men’s Parliament will take place in the Old Assembly Chamber tomorrow (Monday). It will take place under the theme “Institutionalising a Responsive Men’s Movement.” The launch will coincides with International Men’s Day which is observed annually on the 19th of November since 1992. Parliament’s Spokesperson Moloto Mothapo says the National Men’s Parliament became an evident priority after the launch of the “Men Championing Change” campaign during the Men’s Summit in KwaZulu-Natal in August this year. He says the aim of the campaign and the summit was to gather men and the youth to discuss plans to eradicate gender-based violence. Tsenoli and Bogopane-Zulu will on Sunday highlight what the expectations will be when the First National Men’s Parliament is launched tomorrow.
