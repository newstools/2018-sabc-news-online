A 60-year-old mother and her 27-year-old daughter have been arrested in Somerset West outside Cape Town.
They were caught off-loading drugs with a street value of around R8.6 million  at a storage facility. The Hawks say Tik and mandrax were found inside the suspects’ vehicle and the storage unit. They were also in possession of two elephant tusks and a note counter machine. Western Cape Hawks spokesperson, Captain Philani Nkwalase says its teams proceeded to the suspects’ home
in Wetton, where they confiscated more drugs worth about R800-thousand. They also seized an undisclosed amount of money and another vehicle. Nkwalase says two separate cases of dealing in drugs have been opened in Somerset West and Lansdowne respectively.  The two suspects are expected to appear in court soon.
