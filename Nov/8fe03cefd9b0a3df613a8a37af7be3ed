The Investigative Journalism Centre AmaBhungane says it stands by every aspect of its story that the City of Johannesburg allegedly awarded a tender for vehicles to a company linked to Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema and his deputy Floyd Shivambu. The report says the 1.2 billion-rand fleet contract was originally granted to car hire company Avis but was later awarded to Afrirent, which is allegedly used as a slush fund for the EFF. Amabhungane journalist Micah Reddy has dared the EFF to take them to court. However the EFF says it is considering legal action against the Investigative Journalism Centre – the AmaBhungane. The latest revelation against the EFF and its leaders follows less than two months after details that its Deputy President Floyd Shivambo benefitted from the looting of the VBS bank. In Johannesburg it’s alleged the DA led council has awarded a tender for vehicles to a company linked to EFF leaders. But EFF spokesperson Mbuyiseni Ndlozi says this is another attempt to discredit the party. ”The story itself has no evidence in relation to young black business people related to the EFF leader, we are taking this matter to court or to the Ombudsman because it is a smear campaign.”
