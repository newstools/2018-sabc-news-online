At least eight people have been reported killed in Nigeriaâ€™s north-east after militants attacked a camp for displaced people. Witnesses are placing the toll higher at 13 dead, following the attack on Wednesday night in Maiduguri. The witnesses say dozens of attackers overpowered soldiers guarding the Dalori camp and fighting continued for two hours. Militants from the Boko Haram Islamic extremist group frequently attack the area and are known for abducting women and girls. Camp officials say they fear some of the women unaccounted for after the attack have been kidnapped by the gunmen.
