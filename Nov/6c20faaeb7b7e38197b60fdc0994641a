The former South African Airways (SAA) board chairperson Cheryl Carolus is expected to take the stand at the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture in Parktown, Johannesburg on Thursday. Carolus served in the position from 2009 until 2012. She resigned from the position in September 2012 along with six other members of the SAA board. Upon her departure, she told the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) that her relationship with the then Minister of Public Enterprises, Malusi Gigaba, had broken down irretrievably. She stated that her reputation and professional integrity had been dragged through the mud without any clarification or support, making her position untenable.
