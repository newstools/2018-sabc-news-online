In his address, he honoured all the men and women, black and white, who laid down their lives. Wreaths were laid at the cenotaph, a war memorial in the centre of the City. Bells were rung, and two minutes of silence observed. Bells ring at precisely 11:AM on the 11th of the 11th when the WW1 armistice came into effect 100 years ago. Commemorations are taking place all over the globe. #sabcnews pic.twitter.com/nUyKM7FflS — Abra Barbier (@BarbierAbra) November 11, 2018  Representatives from various nations, including the US, Russia and France, laid wreaths on behalf of their countries.
