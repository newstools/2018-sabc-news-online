The baby reportedly fell into the borehole pit at Joppie village outside Tzaneen on Saturday. Police spokesperson Maphure Manamela says they have opened an inquest to determine the cause of the death. “An eighteen month old baby fell into a dip hole at Jopppie village in the Letsitelela policing area on 3 Saturday and members of the search and rescue team again managed to retrieve the body of the boy and we are investigating an inquest case.  Parents are once more urged to look after their children, especially the young ones as they constantly need supervision.”
