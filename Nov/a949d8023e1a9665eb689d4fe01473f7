Hawks spokesperson, Philani Nkwalase says crime intelligence from the Hawks’ Narcotics Enforcement Bureau discovered that narcotics were clandestinely being kept inside a storeroom. This led to the arrest of a 25-year-old man. The multi-disciplinary team found heroin, tik and mandrax and a handgun. Nkwalase says a vehicle, allegedly belonging to the suspect, was also seized. “The suspect is expected appear at Somerset Magistrate’s Court tomorrow (Thursday) to face the alleged charges of dealing in drugs. The Hawks National Head Lieutenant General Godfrey Libeya has applauded the arrest and discovery by the multidisciplinary team adding that the identification and seizure of drugs demonstrate the police commitment to reducing the availability of drugs.”
