The CEO of the South African Institute for Tax Professionals Dr Keith Engels says SARS Commissioner Tom Moyane has been fired because he had failed to defend himself against allegations of mismanagement. On Thursday, the Presidency said President Cyril Ramaphosa had accepted the recommendation of the chairperson of the SARS commission of inquiry, retired judge Robert Nugent, to fire Moyane. Moyane was suspended in March following controversies in the way he managed SARS. Nugent recommended that a permanent commissioner of SARS be appointed. Mark Kingon has been acting as SARS Commissioner. Engels says there was overwhelming evidence against Moyane,” He basically had a public hanging, with an army of people against him. Here we are talking about poor judgment which is very difficult to refute if it comes from employees. So it just makes it very easy to get public support against him.” Meanwhile,  Mark Kingon, Acting SARS Commissioner, was on Morning Live talking about SARS preliminary results.
