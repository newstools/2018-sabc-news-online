The African National Congress’ (ANC) president, Cyril Ramaphosa, is expected to lead a delegation of National Executive Committee (NEC) members to the Eastern Cape this weekend. The NEC members will be dispatched to all the party’s regions, including the disbanded Nelson Mandela Bay region and the troubled Buffalo City region. They will also conduct door-to-door campaigns on Saturday. Ramaphosa is scheduled to address the cadres forum in East London on Sunday. ANC provincial spokesperson Gift Ngqondi explains: “There will be a cadre’s forum on Sunday at City Hall but before the forum there will be a door to door campaign around Mdantsane and some regions but I cannot confirm the sites for now and I will do that on Friday. Some of the NEC members will be in the BCM region and the president’s programme will only be on Sunday.”
