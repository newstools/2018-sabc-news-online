Crime analysts say law enforcement agencies will have to infiltrate crime syndicates if they want to combat the scourge of cash-in-transit heists in the country. Independent analyst, Dr Chris de Kock says in this way the authorities could garner information such as the time and place of the next planned heist. He was commenting after Saturday’s cash-in-transit heist in Katlehong east of Johannesburg. A security guard was shot and wounded.  National Police Commissioner, Khehla Sithole has activated the 72 hour activation plan to mobilise all critical resources to track down and arrest the suspects. De Kock says: “What they will have to do is to get sources within these syndicates, weak points in the syndicates. Get the information and know even before hand before the robbery is going to take place so that they can be ready and hit them on the job.” Regarding the Katlehong heist, SAPS National spokesperson, Vish Naidoo says all critical resources and departments will be mobilised to ensure that the perpetrators are brought to book. “The National Commissioner has instructed the activation of the 72 hour activation plan, which entails the mobilisation of critical resources including crime intelligence, our forensic experts, other specialised units like the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (DPCI), Hawks and our tactical units; to work around the clock for 72 hours so that we do not lose any information, intelligence and evidence that can help us successfully trace and bring these perpetrators to book.”
