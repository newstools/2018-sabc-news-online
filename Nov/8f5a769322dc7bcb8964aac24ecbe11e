The Fisheries Department has announced a more than 40 percent reduction in the Total Allowable Catch (TAC) for crayfish for next season. Spokesperson Carol Moses says the TAC is now at 1084 tons compared to 1924 tons the previous season. Moses said the TAC for commercial offshore fishing is 575 tons and 163 tons for nearshore fishing. He said the season will open on the November 15, 2018 until the March 2019. The World Find Fund for Nature recently approached the High Court to have the TAC reduced due to dwindling crayfish stocks.
