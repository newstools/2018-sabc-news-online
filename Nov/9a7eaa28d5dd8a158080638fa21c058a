Transport Minister Blade Nzimande says government plans to invest just above R4 billion in efforts to improve conditions on the N1 between Kranskop and Makhado in Limpopo. Nzimande was speaking during the launch of the festive season road safety campaign in Modimolle. Nzimande and officials from the province joined by religious leaders cleansed a portion of the N1 which is notorious for fatal crashes. Nzimande says future plans include the separation of traffic lanes. ”There is some more investments that are going to be made here in Limpopo to improve our roads, for instance we need to attend to the fact that the separation of the north bound and south bound carriage ways between Kranskop and Makhado will have to be done in future,” explains Nzimande.
