Political analyst Somadoda Fikeni says President Cyril Ramaphosa’s decision to pay back the donation that Bosasa security company CEO Gavin Watson made to his election campaign for party presidency raises more suspicions on the scale of the problem. The ANC says Ramaphosa will pay back the donation and has called for an investigation into all donations made to his election campaign. In a letter to National Assembly Speaker Baleka Mbete, Ramaphosa says the money was deposited into the trust fund account of his son Andile, without his knowledge. Last week, DA leader Mmusi Maimane questioned Ramaphosa in Parliament on the donation and he said he thought it was payment for his son’s consulting services. Ramaphosa said he was later contradicted when his son denied having received the alleged payment. Fikeni says Ramaphosa should not have given a hasty response initially. “It is better to be late but comprehensive in the responses you give, rather than create doubt that there might still be more other things that need to be investigated and that in itself leaves the President in a very vulnerable state given the fact that there are many other political figures who are under the spotlight precisely for the same thing of relationship between politics and money.” Click video below:
