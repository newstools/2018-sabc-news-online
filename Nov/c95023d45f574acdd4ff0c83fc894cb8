The newly elected Mayor of Matlosana Local Municipality in North West, Washington Ntozini, has tendered his resignation just a day after being elected. Ntozini resigned on Wednesday night, following a meeting with a delegation of senior African National Congress (ANC) National Executive Committee (NEC) members led by Deputy Secretary General Jessie Duarte and North West Premier Job Mokgoro. Earlier, local ANC councillors had colluded with opposition parties to remove Maetu Kgaile as mayor and elect Ntozini. “I am resigning as the executive mayor of Matlosana. I hereby tender my resignation with immediate effect and furthermore, I sincerely apologise to my organisation the ANC for the error that I have committed. I would also like to apologise to the community of Matlosana at large and rate payers to say, we have committed an error and I am ready to rectify the error,” states Ntozini.
