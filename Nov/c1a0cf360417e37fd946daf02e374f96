The Gauteng Department of Education (GDE) has launched the Aviation Science Programme in Newtown, Johannesburg. The department, in partnership with Honeywell Africa, invited over 400 Grade 5 learners with the aim of teaching them the fundamentals of aviation. The learners will be part of the programme until they matriculate.   Gauteng MEC for Education, Panyaza Lesufi says, “The aviation industry is one of the biggest job creation industries. They are massive and they can absorb the majority of our children. We don’t want to prepare our children to be unemployed. We want to prepare them to be part of the economy and to contribute constructively to the economy – especially, bringing the skills that are needed by our economy.”
