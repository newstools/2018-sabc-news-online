As the country battles gender based violence against women and children, Gauteng MEC for Community Safety Sizakele Nkosi-Malobane has called on every man in the country to take a stand and protect women and children. On Sunday, the country launched the annual 16 Days of Activism campaign for no violence against women and children in the country. Nkosi-Malobane has called on religious leaders and parents to start teaching communities and children to change their attitude about women. The MEC says violent incidents against women and children in Gauteng have increased and reached unacceptable levels. Last month, neighbours in Vlakfontein alerted police to a foul smell coming from the Khoza family’s house, south of Johannesburg. Police found seven bodies concealed with piles of sand on the floor and blood stains on the wall. The incident sparked outrage in the community, with some community members calling on the court to impose the harshest sentence against the alleged perpetrators. Last week, one of two taxi drivers behind abductions, rapes and the robbing of female taxi commuters in Gauteng was sentenced to life imprisonment. Lebogang Gift Mokoena was sentenced to 13 life sentences and 340 years in prison in the South Gauteng High Court. Mokoena was found guilty of 13 counts of rape, nine of kidnapping and nine of robbery with aggravating circumstances among others. The Gauteng Community Safety MEC has called on taxi operators to protect women and children in an effort to help fight the scourge.
