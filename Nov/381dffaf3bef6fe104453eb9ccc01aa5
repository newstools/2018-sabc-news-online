Approximately 90 percent of the fire that has been burning in the George and Knysna areas for more than a week has now been contained. Spokesperson for the Garden Route Disaster Management, Herman Pietersen says only a few areas such as Deep Valley, Kransbos and parts of Jonkersburg are still smouldering. Pieterse says fire-fighting teams from other municipalities, who came to assist, will be returning home Wednesday. “Eight working on fire teams will remain in the area until next week Wednesday to assist with mopping up operations. The Garden Route municipality incident management team will continue as normal until Thursday, when a re-assessment of the situation will be done. Overberg, and West Coast District municipality firefighting teams will return to their respective towns this morning.”
