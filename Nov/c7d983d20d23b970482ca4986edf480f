KwaZulu-Natal police are urging shoppers to be vigilant when visiting shopping malls and stores on Black Friday. Thousands of shoppers are making their way to stores to take advantage of markdowns ahead of the festive season. EThekwini Metro police spokesperson Parbooh Sewpersadh says police will be out in full force around major shopping precincts. “Our focus will be on traffic jams, ATM robberies, smash and grabs and all other unlawful activities and we will be enforcing vehicles that have been parked illegally and some will be towed away. The Durban Metro Police Service is ready to have a safe, secure Black Friday for all,” says Sewpersadh. Police urged the shoppers not to park their vehicles illegally because they will be charged and some will be towed away. “Do not leave valuables exposed or visible in your vehicle. People must be vigilant, be patient. Drive early and be vigilant,” says Sewpersadh. Meanwhile, North West provincial police spokesperson, Sabata Mokgwabone, says they’re boosting their presence at malls. “We have also intensified our operations including visibility at various malls in the province. We are ready to deal with any situation and we hope that members of the community will also co-operate with the police to make sure that we don’t have any major incident, especially the robberies. We know that criminals take advantage of the fact that people will be flocking to shopping centres and malls, but we are ready as the police,” says Mokgwabone. WATCH RELATED VIDEOS BELOW:
