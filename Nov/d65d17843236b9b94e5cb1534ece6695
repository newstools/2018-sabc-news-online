Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan‘s statement to the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture, which was leaked before his testimony, is expected to dominate the Commission this week. Gordhan says he met the Guptas at government functions and at a cricket match. Former president Jacob Zuma introduced him to one of the Gupta family members. The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) has already called on the Public Protector to investigate Gordhan, who was former SARS Commissioner and Finance minister. Gordhan is expected to testify on Thursday. Leadership expert, Dr Mazwe Majola, says the question now is whether Gordhan will follow the example of former Finance minister Nhlanhla Nene and step down. “This is exactly the same question will Pravin resign will Pravin follow Nhlanhla Nene because Nene showed them the way. Leadership is modelling, leadership is exemplary. Accountability means a leader is willing to answer for his or her outcomes resulting from his choices, behaviours.” Click video below:
