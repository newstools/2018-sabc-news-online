The National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (Numsa) has rejected the signing of the National Minimum Wage Bill by President Cyril Ramaphosa. Ramaphosa signed the National Minimum Wage Bill of R20 per hour this week. Numsa says the introduction of R20 per hour as a minimum wage will worsen the working conditions of workers and is calling it slavery wages. The union says government should have taken more time to research the salaries of senior executives in various sectors to come up with a fair minimum wage. Numsa Spokesperson Phakamile Hlubi says, “Numsa rejects the minimum poverty wage bill of R20 per hour, as the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa we reject the signing of the minimum wage bill by President Cyril Ramaphosa.” Hlubi says, “The minimum wage bill will legalise the poverty wage bill of R20 per hour. This is an insult to the working class who fought and died to defeat the apartheid government, they were fighting for a living wage that could life them out of poverty and also end the racist apartheid wage gap.” Click below to watch related video:
