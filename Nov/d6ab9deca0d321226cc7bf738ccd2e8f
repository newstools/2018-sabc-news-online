Authorities have advised members of the public to take precautions as the heat wave sweeps through parts of the country. The heat wave will hit Gauteng from Tuesday with temperatures ranging from 34 to 36 degrees Celsius. The Northern Cape, Free State and the North West started to experience extremely hot weather conditions on Monday. The South African Weather Service predicts that the heat wave will remain in place until Sunday in most parts of the country. Emergency services personnel say such conditions could lead to severe dehydration, heat strokes and veld fires. Joburg Emergency Services spokesperson Nana Radebe says, “We are urging people to always wear a hat or stay hydrated. In case of any emergency call from your landline on: 10177 or on your cell phone on: 112.”
