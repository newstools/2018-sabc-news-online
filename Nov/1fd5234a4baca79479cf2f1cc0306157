The Buffalo City Metro in the Eastern Cape says it’s ready to welcome the influx of holidaymakers this festive season. East London is one of the most visited cities in the country around this time of the year and holidaymakers have started to make their way to the city. Buffalo City Metro spokesperson, Smakelo Ngwenya, says all is in order. “We are all systems go as we launched our road safety campaign. We know that our city has been declared the capital city of fun so we are expecting thousands of visitors and also our locals to be all over the city. We are ready on the road, we are ready on air, our cameras are all over the city watching over us when working with the police, we will be having additional life guards- about 52- for the influx of those coming into the city.”
