Bank Zero started its first trial run for staff members on Tuesday after the South African Reserve Bank (SARB) granted it a banking licence. The mutual bank, which is more than 45% black-owned and 20% women-owned, successfully integrated with the national payments systems of the SARB, in September, a move that will bring major benefits to customers.  Co-founder and chairperson of Bank Zero, Michael Jordaan acknowledges the professionalism, skills and world-class systems. “The stringent licencing process, the high standards, and their skilled and professional approach clearly demonstrates that South Africa has a world-class regulator.” Bank Zero Chairperson Michael Jordaan says “Building a bank is hard work; building an innovative bank is exponentially harder”. The Bank Zero is expected to start operations around mid-2019.
