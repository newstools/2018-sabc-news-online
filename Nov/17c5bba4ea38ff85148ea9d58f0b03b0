Police have launched a manhunt for two suspects after a taxi operator and a queue marshall were killed and three passers-bys  wounded in a suspected taxi violence-related shooting at the Noord taxi rank in the Johannesburg CBD. The incident happened on Monday when two attackers entered the taxi rank and opened fire. “It is alleged that two suspects entered the taxi rank and fired shots. A taxi driver and a queue marshall were certified dead at the scene and the three passers-bys were taken to a local hospital with gunshot wounds. The suspects are unknown at this stage and the motive behind the shooting cannot be confirmed but it is suspected it could be related to infighting between taxi associations,” states Gauteng police spokesperson Mavela Masondo.
