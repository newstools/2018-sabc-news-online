The University of Mpumalanga has postponed exams that were scheduled to take place Thursday. This follows the disruption of examinations by workers affiliated to Nehawu. The workers accuse the University’s management of corruption and mismanagement. Nehawu is expected to embark on a march to hand over a memorandum of grievances to the Department of Higher Education and Training on Thursday. Calls are mounting for Vice Chancellor, Professor Thoko Mayekiso and other members of the management to vacate their positions. South African Communist Party (SACP)’s  Secretary in the Philip Radebe District, Bhobert Nkosi says they will be part of the march organised by Nehawu. Earlier this week, Nehawu threatened that a total shutdown will take place at the university should the management fail to meet their demands. However, the University’s management has committed to engage with the leadership of Nehawu to find possible solutions. Watch related video:
