The case of nine men, including two police officers from the Sophiatown Police Station, is expected to be back in the Johannesburg Magistrate’s Court on Friday. All nine suspects were arrested in connection with the gunning down of 21-year-old Bradley Sauls in Westbury, Johannesburg,  three months ago. The suspects are facing a string of charges including murder, conspiracy to commit murder and kidnapping. A group of suspects made a brief appearance in court over a week ago where the case was postponed. Due to safety concerns, officers with bullet proof vests and automatic rifles were stationed at all the entrances of courtroom 21 with only media and a few family members being allowed to witness proceedings. The case was postponed to allow the state time to furnish the defence with the relevant documentation relating to the charges faced by their clients as well a formal bail application. The murder led to massive protests, with the Westbury community calling for Police Minister Bheki Cele to intervene.
