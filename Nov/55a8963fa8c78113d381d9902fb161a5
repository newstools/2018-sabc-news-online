The former mayor of Cape Town Patricia de Lille says she will be laying charges of fraud against two Democratic Alliance (DA) Members of Parliament over a fake Auditor-General report. They allegedly circulated a forged report titled “Patricia de Lille exposed” on social media. It lists a number of breaches by De Lille related to the MyCiti bus procurement process; however the document was confirmed to be fake by the Auditor-General. De Lille initially threatened to sue the MPs if they did not apologise in public. She is set to lay the charges on Thursday morning at the Cape Town central police station.
