The KwaZulu-Natal Dube Trade Port, north of Durban has launched the second phase of its Special Economic Zone which is expected to attract investment of R18 billion in the next five years.  CEO Hashim Erksin says the second phase will focus on the healthcare, pharmaceutical and electronics sectors as part of the national industrial programme. Erskin says this is a much larger development than phase one and will create more jobs. “We’ve set ourselves a target of creating R18 billion worth of private sector investment in manufacturing in the new zone over the next five years. To date in Trade Zone One we were able to create 2000 jobs and about 3500 temporary jobs and in total nearly 13000 indirect jobs within the KZN economy. We are obviously looking to greatly accelerate that now in phase two.”
