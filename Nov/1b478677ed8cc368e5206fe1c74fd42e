South African Communist Party (SACP) national spokesperson, Alex Mashilo has rejected media reports suggestions that the SACP received money from the soon to be defunct VBS Mutual Bank. One of the Sunday newspapers, reported that the SACP received R3 million from Vele Investments. The SACP has reiterated its earlier statement, that if any of its officials has received money illegally from VBS, the party will institute disciplinary actions against them.  Last week Thursday, the SACP suspended former Capricorn District Municipality mayor Gilbert Kganyago following allegations of his linkage to the VBS Mutual Bank looting. Kganyago was suspended with immediate effect as the SACP’s provincial secretary. It’s understood that the municipality deposited R60 million in VBS bank in 2015 without following the municipal council’s approval. Kganyago has denied his involvement in the scandal in the past, but the party says the provincial secretary now has the chance to provide evidence that supports his claims. Meanwhile, Mashilo maintains that if there were any payment made by the VBS to any of the party’s service provider, they would have known by now.
