The heatwave which has affected most parts of the country since last week is coming to an end. The South African Weather Services says temperatures are expected to start dropping from Tuesday. Forecaster Dipuo Tawana says three provinces can expect the mercury to rise to the high 30s on Monday. “The North West province as well as the Free State and the North Eastern part of the Northern Cape we still expect the heat wave to persist and it’s actually ending today, the last day for the heatwave. Otherwise the temperatures from tomorrow are expected to gradually decrease. As for the rains, we had morning rains over the Gauteng province, it’s clearing over most parts and at the moment it’s only raining over Pretoria East and Bronkhorstpruit area.” Watch related video:
