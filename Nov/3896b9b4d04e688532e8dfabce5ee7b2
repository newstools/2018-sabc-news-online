Police in KwaZulu-Natal have arrested a 35-year-old pastor for allegedly raping four girls who were members of his church on Richmond Farm near Lindelani, north of Durban. The alleged incidents date back to 2015, when the suspect allegedly took the girls in under the pretense of being a father figure. Police spokesperson in KZN, Thembeka Mbhele, says the victims are aged between 15 and 19. Mbhele says the suspect will appear in the Ntuzuma Magistrate’s Court on Monday. “There are two dockets, two cases, one opened in Newlands and one in Ntuzuma. The one in Ntuzuma has got three counts because there are three victims where a 35 year- old suspect, who is a pastor, was arrested by police yesterday and he will be appearing in court in Ntuzuma on Monday facing charges of rape. Apparently the information that the police have is that he was targeting the vulnerable victims, either because they are raised by the single parents or by the grannies and he would promise them to be the father figure. He used to sometimes take the victims to his home in Avoca or sometimes take the victims to a certain lodge somewhere in Newlands,” says Mbhele.
