Neighbouring SADC countries – Botswana, South Africa, and Namibia are in talks to reach common ground on the alcohol limit for drivers. The three countries have different alcohol limits, with Namibia leading with the highest number followed by South Africa. This is ensure that what is permissible in one country is not an offence in other countries. With the festive season fast approaching, roadblocks have begun in the North West. Botswana, South Africa, and Namibia are already intensifying their efforts to ensure that road fatalities go down. “In Botswana we are very strict on issues of drunken driving. Our limit is very very low as compared to our contracting parties and we are convincing them to reduce the alcohol limit so that it can equally be the same so that when you are driving from SA and get to Botswana, the same limit should apply,” says  Botswana Acting Co-Chair for Trans Kalahari Corrido,Patrick Motlhanka. In South Africa, law enforcement will be more stringent: “This festive season, we will not tolerate drunken driving. Vehicle unworthiness overloaded vehicles whether in terms of persons or in terms of goods,” says North West Transport MEC, Dr  Mpho Motlabane. A stern warning has been given to those wishing to visit Namibia this festive season. “For the SA and Batswana who would want to go have a holiday in Namibia, they should forget about drinking. That would be a no no. We will have a serious operation. We now already have a national committee on TKC, so that would be a no. The other aspect is speeding,” says Botswana Transportation And Policy Regulation Director, Cedric Limbo. The three countries will also have more strict border regulations this festive season.
