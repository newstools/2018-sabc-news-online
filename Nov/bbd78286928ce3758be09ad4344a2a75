Activist group -Equal Education- is using World Toilet day on Monday to highlight the country’s school sanitation crisis. A number of learners have died in pit latrines in schools due to poor sanitation infrastructure. Civil society groups have gathered in Sandton north of Johannesburg for the World Toilet Day Flush Forum. The meeting seeks to come up with ideas on how to provide decent ablution facilities in schools. Equal Education’s Leanne Jansen-Thomas says they want Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga to comply with the Norms and Standards for School Infrastructure. “The Minister and the MEC of Education in Limpopo cannot muster the efforts and capacity and political will to fix the toilets in Limpopo. The state of toilets in the rural parts of South Africa is dire and what we want is for the minister to engage substantively on the criticalness of the Norms and Standards of Schools Infrastructure.” Watch related video:
