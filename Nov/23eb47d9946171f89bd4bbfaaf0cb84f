The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) have one week to back up claims that veteran journalists, Thandeka Gqubule and Anton Harber were apartheid spies. This comes in the face of a successful access to information court application which revealed the opposite to be the case. Gqubule obtained declassified documents proving that STRATCOM was in fact spying on her. The journalists approached the court to force the EFF to retract the statement and to cough up R1 million in damages. Gqubule was speaking outside the South Gauteng High Court in Johannesburg. “We’ve got historical facts, we’ve got transcripts, and we’ve got recorded conversations all of this I really don’t understand how they can come with this, how they can give a truthful answering affidavit. The mind boggles as to how they can possibly do this, they have seven days and they can use all the hours in those seven days and nothing can change the truth,” explains Gqubule.
