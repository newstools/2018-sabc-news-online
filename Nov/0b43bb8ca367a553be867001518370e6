The South African Police Union says it is not aware of the hardships its members stationed in the remote town of Vostershoop, outside Vryburg in the North West are facing. Police there are compelled to walk to look for suspects due to unavailability of official transport. There has been no running water for four months. The town named after one of the Boer Commandoes who used to rule the country before is situated 379 kilometers from the provincial capital Mahikeng. These officers who prefer to remain anonymous explain their frustrations. “The supply chain tried many times to apply, there is no date stamps. We still using stamps of 2017 and 2018 is almost done. So resources are a disaster and transport is a main concern. Even service delivery is suffering. Sometimes you will find that there is a complaint, you will find out that we only have one car and where is the car by then, at OR Tambo or maybe it is in Vryburg, even now we do not have a single car,” explained a police officer.
