Those in the small scale tourism industry in Mpumalanga are crying foul. They claim that government is not assisting them in realising their potential. They met with Economic Freedom Fighters’ (EFF) Deputy President, Floyd Shivambu, at the party’s public manifesto consultation assembly in Mbombela on Saturday. The party leaders are criss-crossing the country sourcing public opinion. Craft artists in Mpumalanga have complained about their removal from places where they were able to sell their crafts to tourists. Police reservists who attended the meeting also raised concerns that they are not considered when job opportunities arose in the police service. Shivambu promised the people that he would engage with relevant stakeholders to try and find solutions to their concerns. “Fight for your rights to fight what rightfully belonged to you because you cannot be a reservist for 20 years for 10 years they must prioritise you who have been working in that particular sector and there must be even clear focus on the people and selling the arts in the tourism spaces they must be given proper areas with shade and proper protection and proper systems in the areas where the tourists are going to pass by.” The issues raised will form part of the party’s manifesto in the lead up to the 2019 National elections.
