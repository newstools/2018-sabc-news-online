North West premier Job Mokgoro says he will announce the findings of investigations into corruption allegations in the provincial government early next week. A probe was instituted in many departments following reports that there were corrupt activities in the provincial government. One such investigation is about an instance where the former premier Supra Mahumapelo’s office shunned the state owned Information technology service providers and secured services of a private firm. About R100 million was allegedly paid to Nepo Dynamics, reportedly, without following proper supply chain processes. The Hawks raided Mahumapelo’s offices in March. Mokgoro explains, “In the earlier part of the week, I will not give further details, because the matter is prima facie. And I must respect names of individuals, but the time will come, sometime next week, where we’ll be able to be more transparent. We have been doing a lot of investigative work around the ICT project.” Click below for North West related videos….
