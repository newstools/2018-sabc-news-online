Former Mineral Resources Minister Ngoako Ramatlhodi has begun his testimony before the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture in Parktown, Johannesburg, on Wednesday. Ramatlhodi was minister of mineral resources before former President Jacob Zuma moved him to Public Service and Administration in September 2015. He’s expected to reveal his understanding of the Gupta family’s influence over government. So far, Ramatlhodi has described how he met Zuma’s son, Duduzane Zuma – six months into his post as Mineral Resources Minister. “He was insisting, I think six months into [cabinet] as acting mineral resources, and I realised I should see and give him some time. So, I met him at St Georges Hotel at one of the NEC meetings. He then said to me it is a pity we are meeting under these circumstances.” “I asked him to elaborate. He them said to me there is a rumour he has heard from two sources that I have been bad mouthing him and his business associates and saying it was involved in crime – because later on he mentioned Ajay Gupta, so I understood the business associates to be the Gupta brothers,” adds Ramatlhodi.
