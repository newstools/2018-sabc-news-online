The Constitutional Court has dismissed former SABC COO Hlaudi Motsoeneng‘s leave to appeal the Labour court’s ruling that he personally pay the legal cost pertaining to the banning of the coverage of protests. Eight SABC journalists represented by trade union Solidarity won the case in the Labour court. The Labour court ordered that Motsoeneng personally pay the legal costs. He however approached the Labour Appeals court and the Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA) which dismissed his application. He then applied to the Constitutional Court. The Constitutional court dismissed Motsoeneng’s application saying it bears no prospect of success. Solidarity’s legal representative Anthon van der Bijl says: “We are overjoyed with the win. It means it’s the end of the long journey. It means Mr Motsoeneng must pay up. We are going to proceed with the warrant of execution against him. We are looking to go after a few of his houses. We are ecstatic about the win.” WATCH RELATED VIDEO BELOW:
