Former GCIS head, Mzwanele Manyi has asked Advocate Vincent Maleka to recuse himself from the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture. Manyi has complained to the commission, over the manner in which Maleka has been leading his evidence. Manyi is continuing to give his evidence to the commission, in Parktown in Johannesburg. The former GCIS CEO is currently facing questions before the commission’s legal team seeking clarification on his earlier testimony during his tenure at government communications from 2011 until 2012. Manyi says he feels as if he is criminally being probed. Maleka has assured the commission that a rigorous system was used to appoint the commission’s legal team, and all is above board. WATCH BELOW:
