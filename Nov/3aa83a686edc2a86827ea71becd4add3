Former South African Airways (SAA) board chairperson, Cheryl Carolus, says when Malusi Gigaba was Public Enterprises Minister, he was obsessed with SAA’s Johannesburg-Mumbai route which the Gupta-linked India’s Jet Airways was determined to take over. Carolus was testifying before the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture in Parktown, Johannesburg, on Thursday. She served as SAA board chairperson from 2009 until 2012. Carolus says Gigaba once set up a meeting with SAA board members, which she didn’t attend. She says the president of Jet Airways attended the meeting and interrogated board members but Gigaba did not intervene. Watch related video:
