German chipmaker, Infineon Technologies, said on Monday that it expected to achieve a revenue growth of 9-13% in the 2018/19 business year after announcing forecast-beating annual results on the back of strong auto sector demand. Fourth-quarter revenues were 2.047 billion euros ($2.31 billion), up 5% from the prior quarter. This was above both the company’s own 3% forecast and mean expectations in a Reuters poll of 13 analysts. The Fourth-quarter segment result was 400 million euros, compared with 356 million in the prior quarter and mean expectations of 382 million. Full-year revenue growth came in at 8%, beating the company’s own guidance for 6.4-7.4%, while segment margin – a measure of operating profitability at its business units – was 17.8%. The company had guided for a segment margin of 17.5% in the 2017/18 fiscal year. The 2018/19 revenue forecast assumes an exchange rate of $1.15 to the euro.
