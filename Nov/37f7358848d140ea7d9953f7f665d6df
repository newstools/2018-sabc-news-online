The District Six land claims court case between former residents and the Department of Land Reform is set to be heard at the Cape Town High Court on Monday. The District Six Working Committee says claimants have been waiting for restitution for more than 20 years. Close to 3 000 land claims were lodged in the area in 1998. More than half of the claimants opted for financial compensation, while the rest wanted to return to the area. 139 claimants have thus far received housing units. District Six residents were dispossessed of their land under the Apartheid Group Areas Act. Watch related video below:
