The ANC caucus in Parliament has welcomed the news that President Cyril Ramaphosa will reshuffle his cabinet. The Presidency has confirmed that the President will on Thursday afternoon hold a media briefing at the Union Building in Pretoria where he will make changes to his cabinet. The Presidency says the death of Environmental Affairs Minister Edna Molewa in September this year and the resignation of Malusi Gigaba as both Home Affairs Minister and Member of Parliament about a week ago have prompted the cabinet reshuffle. Party Chief Whip Jackson Mthembu, who is briefing the media at Parliament, has also defended Ramaphosa over the Bosasa scandal. Mthembu says, “We applaud our President, where he has made a mistake he has corrected. President Ramaphosa did not intentionally and willfully mislead the house, there was no intention on the President to do so. His conduct will therefore not be categorised as unParliamentary.”
