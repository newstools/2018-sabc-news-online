The CR17 campaign team, which managed President Cyril Ramaphosa’s African National Congress (ANC) presidency election campaign, says it will audit and pay back some donations. This as President Ramaphosa has undertaken to pay back R500 000 which he says he did not know was donated for his campaign by security company, Bosasa. During his last oral reply session in the National Assembly, Ramaphosa had said the payment was for consultancy work done by his son Andile, but later learnt that this was incorrect. “Donations were received from no less than 200 individuals from across the country. The campaign funds received were used to pay for venue hires, transport, accommodation, communications and other campaign related activities. The campaign team says in a statement that, to avoid conflicts of interests and to completely eliminate any expectation of reciprocal intent, action or preferential treatment by donors the fundraising team was ring-fenced from other operations. Subsequent to the ANC’s Nasrec conference, the CR17 campaign folded its operations and used all remaining funds to settle its obligations to service providers. The campaign team also says donors were asked to support the campaign to restore the integrity and cohesion of the ANC and to put South Africa back on a path of growth and transformation, with an explicit understanding that their contribution would earn them no special favours or undue advantage.” Watch related video below:
