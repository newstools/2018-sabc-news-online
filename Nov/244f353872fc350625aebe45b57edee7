Communications Minister, Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams paid a visit to the SABC headquarters in Johannesburg on Thursday. The Minister took time to engage with the board, organised labour and staff. In October, the public broadcaster announced its decision to retrench more than 2 000 employees. The retrenchments are expected to take effect in February 2019. With only five days in office, the main issue on the minister’s agenda was to engage with various stakeholders at the public broadcaster. The Parliamentary Committee on Communications has urged the Board and executive management to be more transparent. They must provide details of the company’s income and expenditure, as well as its cost cutting measures before going down the retrenchment route. The minister says she’s still familiarising herself with the broadcaster’s challenges. Ndabeni-Abrahams urged all stakeholders including staff and unions to do their bit to help overcome difficulties at the broadcaster.
