Defiant dwellers of the Bay West informal settlement near Despatch in Nelson Mandela Bay are rebuilding their shacks, a few days after they were demolished by municipal bulldozers. The Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality assisted by other government agencies demolished about 300 illegal shacks on the R75 between Port Elizabeth and Dispatch. The dwellers who claim to have obtained permission to build their homes on the open veld assembled again today and began the rebuilding process. “This is legal – we have proper documents, they never asked for documents, they just bulldozed our houses,” explains Popo Gijana Ward 53 committee member.
