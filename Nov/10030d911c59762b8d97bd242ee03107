The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) in KwaZulu-Natal has confirmed that former President Jacob Zuma has filed papers seeking a permanent stay of prosecution in the High Court in Pietermaritzburg. Zuma’s co-accused French arms manufacturer Thales filed a similar application earlier on Friday. Last week the High Court in Pretoria ruled that Zuma must personally pay his legal costs for various criminal and civil cases against him. KwaZulu-Natal NPA spokesperson, Natasha Ramkisson-Kara explains: “I can confirm that Thales as well as the former President Jacob Zuma has filed papers in the high court regarding an application for permanent stay of prosecution.” WATCH BELOW:
