A former Kaizer Chiefs and Moroka Swallows legend turned businessman and three others will on Thursday appear at the Randfontein Magistrate’s Court west of Johannesburg. He was arrested on Wednesday for allegedly manufacturing drugs. The Hawks and the Gauteng anti-gang unit uncovered a drug manufacturing laboratory on the main suspect’s farm. Police spokesperson, Brenda Muridili says the police’s crime intelligence have been observing the small holding for a while and they gathered enough evidence to apply for a search warrant which was effected in the early hours of Wednesday morning. That is where the police discovered a laboratory that is used to manufacture mandrax.
