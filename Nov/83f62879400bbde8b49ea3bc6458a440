Sibanye-Stillwater’s management says it has been granted an interdict by the Labour Court against the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) and Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (Amcu) to prevent the unions and their members from committing acts of violence, harassment and intimidation at the company’s operations. The gold mine says the unions and their members are also interdicted from stopping any other employees from going to work and interfering with the mine’s service providers, suppliers and customers. Sibanye-Stillwater’s spokesperson, Thabisile Phumo, says this was necessary after the strike began on Wednesday and several employees were injured during protests. “We’ve got three unions who signed the deal with us and those employees have been prevented from going to work. So the interdict seeks to restore peace and law and order. We respect the rights of Amcu to go on strike but in an orderly and a peaceful manner and that hopefully will ensure that those employees who are not on strike are allowed to also exercise their right to go to work and do so in a way that is safe,” says Phumo.
