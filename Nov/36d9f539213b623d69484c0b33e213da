National Police Commissioner, Khehla Sithole, has activated the recently launched 72 hour activation plan following Saturday morning’s armed cash-in-transit heist east of Johannesburg. Gunfire was exchanged between security guards and the robbers in Katlehong.  One security guard was wounded and has been admitted to hospital. SAPS National spokesperson, Vish Naidoo says all critical resources and departments will be mobilised to ensure that the perpetrators are brought to book. “The National Commissioner has instructed the activation of the 72 hour activation plan, which entails the mobilisation of critical resources including crime intelligence, our forensic experts, other specialised units like the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (DPCI), Hawks and our tactical units; to work around the clock for 72 hours so that we do not lose any information, intelligence and evidence that can help us successfully trace and bring these perpetrators to book.”
