The case against the Dros rape suspect, Nicholas Ninow, has been postponed to January 15 next year. He appeared at the Pretoria Magistrate’s Court after being referred for mental observation at the Weskoppies mental facility in Pretoria West at the beginning of the month. He will be sent to a district surgeon for mental evaluation as an interim measure until a bed becomes available for him at the Weskoppies Psychiatric Hospital. The hospital is currently filled to capacity. The 22-year old cried during his appearance in the Pretoria Magistrate’s Court. Ninow allegedly raped a seven year old girl in the Dros restaurant’s toilet cubicle at Silverton in September this year. He will remain in custody awaiting mental observation at the hospital. ANC Women’s League members are among gender activists and civil society groups protesting outside the court. ANC Women’s League secretary general, Meokgo Matuba says: “We support the victim. We still maintain that a person is innocent until proven guilty by the court of law. We want justice to prevail. We want our government to take the issue of gender based violence seriously.” “We are very comfortable to work with other women’s organisations like with the DA and EFF as we believe that women’s struggles are not political,” adds Matuba.
