The Free State African National Congress (ANC) will hold a media briefing to outline issues faced by two municipalities in the province. Matjhabeng local municipality workers in Welkom have downed tools over unpaid third parties and calling for the axing of the local mayor Nkosinjani Speelman. The other issue relates to the ongoing violent protest in Koffiefontein, where residents are calling for the Letsemeng Mayor Lindiwe Reachable to step down. The ANC met with both Matjhabeng and Koffiefontein residents to listen to their demands and promised to get back to them. Services have been drastically affected at the Matjhabeng municipality since last week Tuesday when workers went on rampage burning tyres and emptying buckets of excrement in front of the municipal offices. Teaching and learning has been disrupted in Koffifontein and learners have not sat for their final exams. Click link for more:
