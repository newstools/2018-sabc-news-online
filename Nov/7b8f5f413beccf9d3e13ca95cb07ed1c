President Cyril Ramaphosa has anchored his speech at the Discovery Leadership Summit on addressing past exclusions and correcting the scourge of corruption. The President earlier addressed the Discovery Leadership Summit in Johannesburg, on Thursday, also being attended by former US President Bill Clinton, his wife and former Secretary of State Hilary Clinton and former UK Prime Minister David Cameron. Ramaphosa says economic growth will be real if it addresses exclusion of black people in general and women and youth in particular. “Growth must address exclusion of black people and women, create employment for young people and women and prepare them for the nature of work of tomorrow, address the skills deficit for quality outcomes. Education must be more responsive to economic needs; people must have access to land and assets; that those who have been involved in corruption must be dealt with because corruption is very bad. But corruption is not only in the public sector, it is also in the private sector. “The dream that we have is that we must cleanse our country of all corrupt activities,” says the President.
