The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) in the Free State is the latest to express disappointment that the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) has provisionally dropped charges against the Gupta family, their business associates and some agriculture officials in the Estina dairy farm case. The NPA says the decision is necessary as it’s still awaiting more evidence from India and the UAE. The Democratic Alliance (DA) has already said it’s determined to pursue the matter to ensure those responsible are held to account. Expressing a similar view, EFF provincial chairperson Mandisa Makhesini says the party will not let this slide. “As EFF we are not happy at all because you’re the one who opens a case in 2015 regarding the issue of the Frede Dairy farm and the corruption happening. As EFF we are going to meet with the NPA in the province and we are going to challenge, but we are very concerned about the fate of the people of Phumelela Municipality because they have been robbed of their wealth by the provincial government.  We are not going to allow them to do anything that they want to do.” Watch related videos below:
