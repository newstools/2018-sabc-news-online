Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane says her meeting with Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan is not the end of her investigations nor interactions with the minister. Acting spokesperson Oupa Segalwe says the parties have agreed to meet again if necessary. Segalwe claims Mkhwebane was forced to subpoena Gordhan after the minister allegedly failed to respond to the 2016 allegations of maladministration at South African Revenue Service (SARS). Segalwe says the allegations that the Public Protector wanted clarity with Gordhan related to his approval of the early pension and reappointment of Commissioner Ivan Pillay, despite a court finding that Gordhan did not have a case to answer. “Questions were put to the minister by the Public Protector and the minister responded. He also provided certain documents to the Public Protector. So this is part of an ongoing investigation process and the PP (Public Protector) will then carry on with that investigation. The PP may at the later stage write to the minister to seek clarity here and there. This does not mean that it is the end of the road in terms of the interaction between the two where this particular matter is concerned.” The office of the Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane says her closed meeting with Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan went smoothly this morning – but has disclosed no further details.#sabcnews — SAfm news (@SAfmnews) November 14, 2018
