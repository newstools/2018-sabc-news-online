The African National Congress (ANC) has thrown its weight behind the party’s Gauteng leadership on the need to review e-tolls in the country’s richest province. ANC Treasurer General Paul Mashatile says the system is unworkable and unaffordable. His comments to the SABC follow the apparent mixed messages expressed by Finance Minister Tito Mboweni in his Medium Term Budget Statement and Gauteng Premier David Makhura. Mboweni insisted that South Africans must pay for the roads they use, while Makhura said there is no future for e-tolls in Gauteng. Mashatile feels the system in Gauteng is a special case. “I think what government must do is to go with tolling of roads user principle but perhaps review the e-toll in Gauteng and introduce a system that citizens of Gauteng will find acceptable and affordable. You can come with another method that the citizens will find purely acceptable, we should not be afraid to review our decisions.” Related video click below:
