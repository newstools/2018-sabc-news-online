The poor turnout at the “free the king” march in the Eastern Cape at Mthatha did not deter the marchers from pressing on with their call for the release of jailed AbaThembu king Buyelekhaya Dalindyebo. Less than 40 people marched from eNkululekweni to Freedom Square in the city centre demanding his release before Christmas. The king was sentenced to 12 years imprisonment in 2015 for arson, attempted murder and defeating the ends of justice. One of the march organisers, Prince Babalo Zanodumo, says Dalindyebo’s nation needs him. “People had commitments. We understand that they were busy and they had other issues to deal with. The king is the father. As a nation we need to be with our parents for Christmas, and even his own biological children would love to have him for Christmas just like any kids that would love to be with their parents on Christmas Day. The communication that we got from the Presidency, that is the Chief of Staff, is that they’ve requested the local municipality to receive on behalf of the president,” says Zanodumo. The marcher’s petition was received by KSD municipality Head of Public Safety, Tshepo Machaea. “Having received the petition, we are going to forward it to the relevant office within the province, which is going to channel it to the office of the president,” explains Machaea.
