The Auditor General  Kimi Makwetu says the overall number of clean audits for both provincial and national government for year 2017-2018 has declined. They have decreased from 129 to just under 100. Makwetu says while results of 43 auditees improved, they have been overshadowed by the 73 that regressed. The Western Cape and Gauteng remain on top of the list with clean audits while North West and Free State are the only two provinces with disclaimers. Makwetu says there is a still a lot to be done to get things right. “We are not where we should be as far as the adherence to the discipline of financial management across all provinces. Because we still have a litany of departments and entities that even though they may be able to account for their transactions are still flouting supply chain and other control systems.” The financial health of the provincial departments of health and education needs urgent intervention to prevent the collapse of these key service delivery departments. #AGReport pic.twitter.com/ojOcXTQPwD — Auditor-General SA (@AuditorGen_SA) November 21, 2018  Makwetu painted a bleak picture of the audit outcomes of both national and provincial governments with increase in unauthorised expenditure, as well as fruitless and wasteful expenditure while irregular expenditure continues to remain high.
