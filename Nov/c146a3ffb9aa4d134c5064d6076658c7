Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi and Police Minister Bheki Cele are expected to visit Letaba Hospital in Limpopo on Friday following Thursday’s attack on doctors. Two doctors were shot and seriously wounded when five heavily armed suspects broke into the doctors’ residence. The wife of one of the doctors, a nurse was also assaulted with a sharp object. Limpopo police spokesperson Moatshe Ngoepe says they’re working around the clock to hunt down the five suspects. “The provincial commissioner of the SAPS in Limpopo, Lieutenant General Nneke Ledwaba has established a special task team following these suspects around the clock and at this stage we have since opened cases of attempted murder and house robbery. Anyone with information about who the suspects are may contact Colonel Cecil Machimana at 08245417181,” says Ngoepe.
