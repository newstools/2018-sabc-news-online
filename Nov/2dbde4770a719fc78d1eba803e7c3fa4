The Executive Secretary of the Council for the Advancement of the Constitution, Lawson Naidoo, says it not ideal to have so many former NPA prosecutors shortlisted to possibly become the new Director of the Prosecuting Authority. On Friday, the Presidency released the names of 12 candidates who have been shortlisted. An opposition member of Parliament and former National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) prosecutor, Glynnis Breytenbach, has also been shortlisted. President Cyril Ramaphosa had appointed an advisory panel, headed by Energy Minister Jeff Radebe, to identify potential candidates. Naidoo says the many former and current prosecutors on the list is worrying. “I think given the fractious nature of the NPA, and the divisions, deep divisions, within that institution I think it is questionable whether someone who comes from within the NPA would be suitable to head the organisation.” The interviews for the shortlisted former NPA candidates to become the new Director of the Prosecuting Authority are scheduled to take place behind closed doors next week. Naidoo says public interviews would have assisted in the process of restoring confidence in the prosecuting authority. “I think it is a missed opportunity not to be held in public because I think the public wants to see the scrutiny of these people and to be really sure that the right person is appointed and is being done for the right reasons. We need to see the breadth of experience and capability before people will have confidence that this person is going to lead the process of rebuilding public confidence in the NPA.” Presidency spokesperson, Khusela Diko says the panel will now give the list to the President and the top three candidates will then be chosen.
