A 35 year pastor from Richmond Farm near Lindelani is to appear in the Ntuzuma Magistrateâ€™s court north of Durban on Monday, facing four charges of rape. He was arrested last Friday after the community went on the rampage following reports that he had allegedly raped four young girls who are members of his church. The tent that was used by his church has since been removed. The alleged incidents date back to 2015. Police have revealed the victims are aged between 15 and 19. The pastor allegedly preyed on girls coming from vulnerable families of single parents and pretended to play a father figure to his victims.
