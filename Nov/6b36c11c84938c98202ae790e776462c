A former PRASA train driver has won his battle against the passenger rail operator. He was unfairly dismissed following a train accident last year. The collision was one of a dozen incidents that occurred in the last 12 months. Kgomotso Senokwane is a Metrorail driver, one of hundreds responsible for the transport of about two million commuters daily. Last June, the trip from Elandsfontein to Jhb was his last ride. That morning commute ended with one dead and fifty five injured when the train he was operating collided with another. Senokwane explains: “I was authorised to pass at a couple of the signals because they were not in operation on the way to my destination signal. I collided with another train.” At the time it was a manual operation due to cable theft which hindered automatic signals. The train driver was suspended and his legal battle began. Senokwane: “I was charged with 6 charges of misconduct, went to the CCMA and they ruled that I was unfairly dismissed and compensated with 6 months’ salary.” The Rail Safety Regulator suspended PRASA’s safety permit after an October accident left 320 injured. The High Court ruled the train operator complied with the safety requirements. Watch below as a former train driver wins battle against PRASA:
