The Orange River Producers Association says around 15% of its table grape harvest will have to be converted to raisins due to damage of extreme heat. And with a world shortage of raisins and good prices, farmers will still be smiling all the way to the bank. The Northern Cape is the only province that is expected to deliver a better crop than last year. The South African Table Grape Industry says this positive result links to new plantings and new cultivars. A farmer along the Orange River, Willie Du Plessis says the prospects are looking good – and they want to invest majorly in the raisin industry. Du Plessis and other farmers want to export their produce. Willie du Plessis a farmer says: “It is very good for our region; we can also make raisins as well. So for a marginal block you can change it to raisins for a good price, and it is good for our region – Upington, Kakamas, and the Orange River.” This year’s harvest will start two weeks later than usual. Du Plessis says the late harvest won’t have a severe impact on the prices. “No it is not a problem for us, because the early regions also have good harvest, and it is better that they get into the market, and get it out, we would rather take a good quality product,” says Du Plessis. These farmworkers – who are also shareholders of a farm – say the farming is tough business. “When you start, you’ll be very sceptical and wonder if you will make any money, and after five years you’ll see that you made profit,” “Our harvest look very good, but if you compare it with last years harvest last years harvest is better than this year’s harvest,” Thousands of seasonal farm workers will flock to the region, with harvesting season expected to start soon.
