The Higher Education Minister Naledi Pandor says government’s partnership with institutions of higher learning is to build sustainable universities. Pandor was speaking at the University of the Western Cape during the launch of a multi-million-rand maths and science building. The building houses high technology and virtual reality equipment that will drive the fourth industrial revolution. The building is designed to put together economic management sciences as well as chemical, mathematics and sciences faculties. Pandor says institutions should be committed to funding part of the costs of development projects. “What’s great about the infrastructure grant is that it’s a partnership,  we do make resources available but universities must bring their own money as well. They also have to go out there and raise funds from the donors so you will find in most of the projects there is government, the university, donors and I think what it does is make each of us put the best plan forward,” explains Pandor.
