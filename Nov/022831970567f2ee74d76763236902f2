Services have grounded to a halt at Matjhabeng Municipality in Welkom in the Free State, as more than a 1000 workers have embarked on a strike. South African Municipal Workers’ Union (Samwu) members have gone on a rampage, demanding the municipality make outstanding payments to third parties. Samwu local secretary, Welcome Makhobotloane says they have tried on a number of occasions to address the issue with the municipality. Makhobotloane says the workers now want the mayor to step down with immediate effect. “We are not on strike, workers are simply here, we have reported for work but all that they are demanding is that what is owed to them should be paid with immediate effect. Their provident funds have not been paid for months, their policies and their medical aid schemes because those monies are deducted from salaries but not paid to relevant services providers. We want to see the removal of the mayor because he’s busy now with the process of removing the second municipal manager after he removed the first one. So that shows that the root cause of this problem may not be the management as such but is more political,” states Makhobotloane.
