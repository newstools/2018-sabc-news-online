Former Kaizer Chiefs and Moroka Swallows player, Mike Mangena, has been granted R50 000 bail at the Randfontein Magistrates Court, West of Johannesburg. Mangena and his three co-accused, Morena Maqoaelane, William Kazipata and Kennedy Tsogolane were arrested last Wednesday. They have been charged with manufacturing illegal drugs on a property owned by Mangena in Hillside, Randfontein. Police raided the small holding after three weeks of surveillance. After spending the weekend behind bars, Mangena has been granted bail of R50 000 by the Randfontein Magistrate’s Court. This is on condition that he doesn’t make contact with any of the state witnesses. He is also not allowed to leave Gauteng without permission from the investigating officer. His three co-accused have all abandoned their bail applications and they will remain in custody. The case has been postponed to the 21st of February next year for further investigations.
