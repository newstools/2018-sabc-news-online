The SABC’s consultation process on the possible retrenchment of 981 permanent and non-renewal of contracts of 1 200 freelancers will begin in Johannesburg on Tuesday. The 60-day process will involve SABC management, the workers unions MWASA, CWU and BEMAWU and other stakeholders. This is in line with Section 189 of the Labour Relations Act in the process which will be facilitated by the CCMA. Last week SABC Group Executive Human Resources, Jonathan Thekiso, said that should the retrenchments go ahead, staff would be notified at the beginning of February 2019. “The duration of the consultation process is legislated at 60 days. So 60 days from the 13th of November and at the end of the consultation session, is only when we will be in a position to conclude on the process and from the beginning of February we will then start issuing notice letters.” Related video click below:
