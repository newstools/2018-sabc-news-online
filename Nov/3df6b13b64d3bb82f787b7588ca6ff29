Western Cape Premier Helen Zille has been appointed as the DA’s political head for the Knysna Constituency. This is part of the party’s plans for the 2019 Election Campaign. The Provincial Executive Committee ratified Zille’s appointment to the position this week.  The DA’s East Regional Chairperson, Jaco Londt, has welcomed the appointment. “As head of one of the best regional governments in the world, she is the ideal person to sell the successes of the Western Cape over the last 2 terms. Helping us to ensure that we retain the Western Cape and get premier Alan Winde elected in 2019.”
