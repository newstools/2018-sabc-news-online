The Gauteng government has commended police for their arrest of a man in connection with the decomposed bodies of two children found buried in a shallow grave behind the Slovoville Cemetery near Soweto. The two siblings aged eight and nine were reported missing in September. Their bodies were found on the first of last month. They had been blind folded and their hands were bound. The man believed to be the siblings’ mother’s ex-boyfriend was arrested in Mpumalanga last week. Spokesperson of the Gauteng Community Safety Department Ofentse Morwane, “We hope that to a certain extent that this will help the family to find closure in this matter, but wish also to take this opportunity to commend the police officers who worked around the clock to make a breakthrough in this case. We further want to caution our citizens in Gauteng, to say as and when they bring anybody into their family, they should make efforts to check the background of that particular person.” See related video:
