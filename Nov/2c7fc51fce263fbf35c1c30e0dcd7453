President Cyril Ramaphosa has warned the European Union (EU) against racism and xenophobia during a speech in Strasbourg, France. This comes amid global concern about the resurgence of the right wing in many European countries. Europe is still dealing with the effects of the massive immigration wave that swept into the continent more than two years ago. Ramaphosa says the EU and the world needs to be vigilant. “The resurgence of racism and xenophobia cloaked into the mantle of nationalism is rising and is causing a great deal of concern in a number of places. Unilateralism is on the rise and threatens in many ways to underline our collective commitment to democratic values and the respect of human rights. Now, more than ever, we turn to our great leaders for strength and inspiration as we seek to resolve some of the most pressing issues of our times,” he says. Watch video below:
