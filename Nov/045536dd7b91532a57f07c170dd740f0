The Democratic Nurses Organisation of South Africa (Denosa) is calling on government to address the shortage of medical personnel and lack of medical equipment urgently in Mpumalanga. Denosa is holding a two-day provincial congress in Mbombela, Mpumalanga. This congress is for electing new provincial leadership and to reflect on progress made in improving the lives of those in the nursing profession. But the critical situation at health care services is also being highlighted as the acute shortage of staff is hampering delivery. Denosa provincial secretary Mzwandile Shongwe says: “We want government to provide more human resources, there is a shortage of nurses at hospitals, nurses are actually compelled to do work that they are not supposed to do.” Denosa also wants government to upgrade health infrastructure and provide adequate medical equipment. Mpumalanga Health MEC Sasekani Manzini says: “We are fortunate because recently there was a budget adjustment and some of the funds will be directed to some of the projects that need to be attended to. This conference gives us time to engage each other and see how best we can address some of the challenges.” The conference concludes on Thursday.
