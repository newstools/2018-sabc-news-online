Residents of Postmasburg in the Northern Cape are accusing the Tsantsabane Local Municipality of failing to provide water to them. This comes after the R32 million owed by the municipality to the Sedibeng Water Board. Residents say they haven’t been had access to water for the past two months and depend on water supplied by tanks. The residents say they demand answers, as there hasn’t been proper communication from the municipality regarding the water situation. A resident says,”The situation here in Marateng is very depressing. We have to call first so that we can get water and the water comes once a week. If we don’t call they don’t come. I don’t know what to say because we’ve asked questions and no one gave us answers. They must make a plan; they must give us an answer.” Another resident says, “We cannot flush our toilets, we cannot wash properly. We’ve got washing to be done and some of us are working people of which we are missing each and every time when the truck is coming to our homes to deliver.”
