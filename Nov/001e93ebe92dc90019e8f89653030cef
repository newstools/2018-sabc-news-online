The SABC Board and senior executives will be back in Parliament to re-appear before the Standing Committee on Public Accounts  (Scopa) Wednesday morning. The Board was sent back by Scopa last week after presenting what the committee found to be an ill prepared presentation which lacked detail. Scopa says the Board is expected to be questioned about irregular expenditure worth billions of rands. This includes more thanR500 million wasted under the current SABC Board. Scopa Chairperson Themba Godi explains,” Out of the R4,9 billion  of irregular expenditure R571 million was incurred in the last twelve months under the current leadership. Now they are giving us a breakdown of the instances and the names of the companies which amounts to about 118 pages. What was missing and which is what we expect them what to do is to be able to indicate to us which officials where responsible for each of those transactions. And what action has been taken against those officials because it might actually represent money that might actually have been wasted which could have actually saved the institution(SABC), the millions that it needs and to keep it viable and to guarantee the future of its employees.”
