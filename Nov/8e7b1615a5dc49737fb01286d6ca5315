The DA in Gauteng says the only way to fight the scourge of gender-based violence is through the professionalism of the police service. Today marks the start of the 16 Days of Activism for No Violence against Women and Children. A recent study released by the Commission for Gender Equality has revealed that the police stations surveyed across three provinces donâ€™t have well-defined long-term programmes in place to tackle domestic violence within their areas of jurisdiction. The study also found that while most police stations surveyed had a Victim Support Centre, these centres did not have enough staff. In a statement, DA Gauteng Spokesperson on Women, Stefani Ueckermann says they will be running a petition, calling for officers to be adequately trained to deal with victims of rape and other sensitive crimes.
