The case of a 32-year-old man who allegedly murdered his girlfriend in a fit of rage has again been postponed in the High Court in Kimberley. The case will be heard in March next year. Siyanda Gxwati allegedly stabbed 28-year-old Refilwe Letebele at least seven times at her family home in January in an incident which shocked the community of Kimberley. He then attempted to turn the knife on himself but his suicide attempt failed. Gxwati is currently out on R5 000 bail. Leaders of women’s rights advocacy group Rise Abafazi Movement, Mpho Assegaai has bemoaned the postponement and says those who are facing charges of femicide should not be granted bail. She says: “It is unacceptable to give femicide accused bail. Our constitution needs to be amended to favour women and children more. If it means the death penalty must come back for these criminals to wake up, so be it.”
