Former Cape Town Mayoral Committee member for transport, Brett Herron is confident he will be found innocent of any wrongdoing regarding the improper procurement of electric buses in the Mother City. Herron says when the allegations against him first emerged in November last year, he wrote to the Speaker of the Council requesting an investigation into the matter. Speaker Dirk Smit laid criminal charges against Herron and former mayor Patricia de Lille on Tuesday. Herron says the Bowman law firm found nothing against him. “I have some evidence that there has been political interference in the process, and I’m concerned about that. My lawyers are writing to the party to record that what the party is putting out there in public is factually incorrect.” Herron adds, “It certainly feels like there is a vendetta against me, and when the investigations are completed, I’m sure that they will conclude that I have done nothing wrong… and those who accuse me of doing something wrong will have to face the consequence.”
