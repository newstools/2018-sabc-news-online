President Cyril Ramaphosa and Police Minister Bheki Cele have formally launched the Anti-Gang Unit in Hanover Park, Cape Town. The area is one of the worst affected by gang violence. The unit, which consists of 95 members, has been in operation since the eighth of last month. Members of the unit will be deployed to other crime-ridden areas such as Nyanga, Bonteheuwel and Bishop Lavis. Ramaphosa says both the national and provincial governments, as well as the police, have heard the pleas of communities of gang-affected areas. He says, “We have listened to your pleas for help and today we are here to take action, not just for communities in the Western Cape but for countries around the country as well. Gang activity is synonymous with all the illegal and illicit enterprises, not just involved in the drug trade but also involved in human trafficking and smuggling and a whole lot of other illegal and illicit activities.” Click below for more:
