The Constitutional Court is expected to rule on Thursday on a request by the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) to be granted a further extension to collect and verify the addresses for all registered voters on the voters’ roll. The IEC has asked the court for a further extension until November the 29th next year. This will be after next year’s provincial and national elections. In its 2016 judgment, the Constitutional Court held that the IEC’s failure to compile a voters’ roll with valid addresses was inconsistent with the Constitution. In 2016, the Constitutional Court gave the Electoral Commission until June 30 this year to complete the addresses for all registered voters on the voters’ roll. The court also ordered the commission to file six-monthly reports to set out steps taken to obtain the outstanding addresses. By December 2016, the commission reported it had captured the complete addresses of 72% of registered voters but the subsequent reports showed there had been little progress. In August, this year the commission brought an urgent ConCourt application asking for a further extension until November 2019. The court has already given the commission an interim extension until the end of this month. Judgment will be handed down on Thursday. Related video
