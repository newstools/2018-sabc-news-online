Former Cape Town mayor, Patricia de Lille, says her new political party will aim to fight racism. De Lille is expected to announce the name of her new political party soon – aiming to contest the 2019 elections in all provinces. She resigned as the city’s executive mayor and from the DA last month, after an 18-month battle with the party. De Lille says her idea of a new political movement is one that’s going to positively change the political landscape in South Africa… “I believe that the majority of people in SA are not racists, that the majority of South Africans are good people, but we need to confront racism that is still very rife in our country. You cannot just put it under the carpet and deny that it doesn’t exist. It needs to be confronted and that is what the good people will do. We will fight racism and I am going to be quite vocal about the issue of race.” Watch related videos:   Twitter poll:
