Civil rights group AfriForum says it will send a warrant it has obtained to attach assets of the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) and its leader Julius Malema, to the relevant sheriff of the court. AfriForum says it was granted the warrant earlier this month by the North Gauteng High court in Pretoria to recover legal costs. These were incurred in cases that AfriForum brought against Malema and the EFF to prevent them from inciting people to seize land illegally, something which it says Malema has done at public gatherings. AfriForum says it won the case and that Malema and the EFF were also ordered to pay legal costs of over R330 000. The group says these costs have never been paid and that itâ€™s determined to recover them by seizing assets belonging to the EFF and its leader. Watch related video below
