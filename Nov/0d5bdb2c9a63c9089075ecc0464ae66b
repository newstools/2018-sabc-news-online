The interview process in search for the next National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) head will start on Wednesday. There are 12 candidates who have been shortlisted for the position including former public prosecutor Glynnis Breytenbach who is now a Member of Parliament (MP) for the Democratic Alliance (DA). “We believe that the process thus far is one that will hopefully allow for a person of integrity and dependence, who will be able to restore confidence to the NPA to be appointed,” states Freedon Under Law’s Executive Officer Nicole Fritz on Morning Live. The Right2Know Campaign is challenging President Cyril Ramaphosa to allow open media coverage of the process at the Pretoria High Court on Tuesday. The position became vacant in August after the appointment of Shaun Abrahams and removal of his predecessor, Mxolisi Nxasana, was ruled as invalid and unconstitutional by the Constitutional Court.
