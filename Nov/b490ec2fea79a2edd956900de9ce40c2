The SABC has always adopted an editorial policy of not naming the suspect until he/she has appeared in court and pleaded. Thus in the current case of a famous retired soccer legend being arrested on drug related charges, the SABC has adopted the above mentioned guideline. There are no hard set rules, or  general statutory prohibition on naming any accused before they have appeared in court and pleaded. However, there are specific instances where it may not be done as it is legislated by the Criminal Procedures Act , and others where it might not be advisable to do so.  The Press Council has updated their guidelines, effective January 2016, and these guidelines also need to be put into consideration.
