Former President Jacob Zuma has urged party supporters not to withhold votes because of their dissatisfaction with certain leaders. Zuma was speaking during an election mobilisation campaign in KwaMashu, north of Durban. ANC leaders have begun criss-crossing the country to garner support for next year’s national elections. Zuma was out and about at a local taxi rank, encouraging the public to ensure they are registered to vote. He also spoke to the elderly during a wellness day organised for senior citizens. Zuma used the platform to make an appeal to party supporters where he said people must not boycott the poll out of anger. “Anger is a disease to some people. When they don’t like me, they’ll say we won’t vote for the ANC because Zuma leads it. We must love the ANC. We can’t take the ANC out of power just because we don’t like a certain leader or leaders. If we don’t like someone, we will remove him at a conference. I must not make the ANC lose just because I don’t like Zuma. Let’s vote for the ANC first then discuss Zuma later.” Meanwhile, the former President has filed his application seeking a permanent stay of prosecution in his corruption trial. Zuma faces 16 charges including corruption and money- laundering. His application joins that of his co-accused, French arms company, Thales, which has also applied for a permanent stay of prosecution. WATCH RELATED VIDEO BELOW:
