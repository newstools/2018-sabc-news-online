The High Court in Johannesburg has struck the challenge to the African National Congress’ (ANC) dissolution of the North West’s Provincial Executive Committee (PEC) off the roll – ruling that the matter is not urgent. Former ANC North West chairperson, Supra Mahumapelo and four others were in court on Tuesday to contest the ANC’s National Executive Committee (NEC) decision in August to dissolve the PEC and replace it with a task team headed by North West Premier Job Makgoro. Reacting to the ruling Former ANC PEC member Aron Motswana described the scrapping of their matter from the court roll as a temporary set back. “I don’t think either the ANC can be happy that the matter has been struck out of the roll because this is a temporary set back. The matter is still going to be heard. We are not going to tire in pursuing this matter,” says Motswana.   WATCH RELATED VIDEO:
