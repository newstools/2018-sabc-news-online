The Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (Amcu) has strongly condemned the on-going violence at Sibanye-Still Water Gold operations and Beatrix mine in the Free State. The union embarked on a protracted strike on Wednesday. Amcu says its members were attacked by a group of people said to be National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) members while traveling to their place of residence on Wednesday night. The union says mine security at Beatrix also attacked their members who were picketing outside with rubber bullets. Secretary General of Amcu, Jeff Mphahlele says they have written to NUM leadership, the Police Minister and the Minister of Minerals Resources to intervene in  the on-going violence. Meanwhile, NUM has rejected claims that they attacked Amcu members. Mphahlele adds, “Attack and the intimidation towards our members are regarded as aimed at declaring our strike violent which would give Sibanye-Still water ammunition to run to the labour court and interdict the strike. We condemn these incidents with the strongest terms, they deserve and call on our members to remain calm and refuse to be drawn into violence.” Watch related videos:
