The Rahima Moosa Mother and Child Hospital says the cause of a recent outbreak in which nine babies died is still not known. The National Institute of Communicable Diseases was called in to investigate after 42 infants picked up a peculiar stomach bug. They could not find any single bacterial cause and have ruled out poor hygiene. Ninety per cent of the babies who died were born prematurely. The hospital says the outbreak happened over a one year period and 28 babies have since been discharged. The South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) says there is a looming crisis in Gauteng Hospitals. SAHRC’s Buang Jones says:”So we have decided as the Human Rights Commission to commence with the subpoena process to subpoena the MEC of health in Gauteng and the head of department doctor Lukhele.” “We want to find out from them what are they going to do with the lamentable state of hospitals in Gauteng, we are hearing the same things: overcrowding, lack of equipment, staff shortages.”
