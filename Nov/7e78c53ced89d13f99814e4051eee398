Former Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba says he will take Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane’s findings on the Fireblade Aviation matter on judicial review. Gigaba released a statement on Tuesday announcing his resignation, which has been accepted by President Cyril Ramaphosa. Transport Minister Blade Nzimande is acting in his position. The Presidency said that Gigaba’s resignation as minister is not an admission that he lied under oath, as a court and Mkhwebane have found. Presidency spokesperson Khusela Diko says the President did not force Gigaba to resign. Diko says, “He had a meeting at his request with the President last week Friday, at which Minister Gigaba would have taken the President into confidence on the issues that were in the public domain that concerned the conduct and role of the minister in a number of affairs. He makes it very clear that he is resigning for the sake of the country; he is resigning for the sake of the movement to which he belongs.” “The minister has also said that it is not an admission of guilt on his part. At this point, we do not have facts on hand that indicate that Minister Gigaba at any point has admitted any guilt to any issues or that the President would have pushed Minister Gigaba,” adds Diko.
