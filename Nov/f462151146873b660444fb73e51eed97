United Democratic Movement (UDM) leader Bantu Holomisa says the departure of the chief executive officer of Public Investment Corporation (PIC) Dan Matjila is long over-due. The Ministry of Finance says Matjila, who has denied allegations of misusing funds and making careless investment decisions, intends to resign. President Cyril Ramaphosa ordered an inquiry into Africa’s biggest pension fund earlier this year, after opposition parties alleged that Matjila was channeling PIC funds meant for corporate social investment to finance his girlfriend’s personal project. Matjila has denied the allegation, describing it as malicious. Holomisa says witnesses in PIC should be heard. “Let those workers go and testify freely. If they don’t want Matjila, the board can still suspend him and wait until the investigation has passed. All what we need is to make sure that the PIC inquiry is well conducted and people are free to testify,” adds Holomisa. <a href="https://iono.fm/e/628564">Content hosted by iono.fm</a>
