Residents of Bloemfontein have expressed sadness at the gutting of the well-known restaurant and nightclub, Cubana. The establishment has burnt to ashes. It is believed that the blaze was caused by a faulty cable inside the building. Workers say the fire broke out early on Saturday and no customers were inside when the incident occurred. The fire department took more than two hours to contain the fire. Locals are concerned about their entertainment place as the festive season approaches as Cubana was a popular spot. “I actually feel very sad you know I’m so used to having Cubana around.” Some locals say that they found out about the blaze through social media. “I woke up very devastated to the fact that Cubana has been burnt down. I saw on Facebook that Cubana is burnt down then I rushed down here to see what’s going on and my plan was actually to come here tonight and enjoy the night here.” The Mangaung Metro Municipality says it will await a police report on the extent of the damage. Mangaung spokesperson, Qondile Khedama says the fire department were quick to extinguish the fire. “Our fire people were able to contain that. As we speak there’s no other building that has been affected. So we will wait for police report just to find out what was the cause of the fire.” Cubana restaurant owners were not available for comment.
