Volunteer teachers at Masakhaneni High School in KwaMakhutha south of Durban are calling on Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga to intervene in their grievances. The teachers say in August the KwaZulu-Natal Education Department promised to absorb them into the system, but they say they have been severed with letters saying that new staff will be placed at the school. The embattled school has been faced with numerous challenges including a stabbing incident in which two learners died on the school premises. The teachers are calling on the department to urgently deal with the matter. Meanwhile, provincial Education spokesperson Kwazi Mthethwa says they did not promise the volunteers permanent positions at the school. Mthethwa said, “We have never placed any volunteers in that school in the first place as the Department of Education in KZN. We have a lot of surplus educators in this province, they are not guaranteed any job placement so we do not have any contractual obligations to place them. We have appointed legitimate teachers there and they will start as soon as possible.”
