Disaster management officials have been sent to various sections of Khutsong on Gauteng’s West Rand after strong winds blew-off roofs of several houses including two churches Tuesday night. One person was injured after bricks fell on top of him.  Some of the affected houses are in Khayalethu section and surrounding areas.  West Rand police spokesperson Eddie Boboko says residents have been left destitute. “Some of the houses people couldn’t move out of the houses because there were some rooms that were not affected. The residents managed to sleep in their houses, and the police were also summoned to patrol those areas to avoid any criminal activities to take place.”
