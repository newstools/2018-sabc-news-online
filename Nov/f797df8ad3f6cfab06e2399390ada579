Eastern Cape police are hot on heels of a suspect who allegedly raped a 74-year-old grandmother on Saturday last week in her homestead in New Locality at Hofmeyr in the province’s interior. It’s alleged that the victim was sleeping alone when the unknown man broke into her house. Police Spokeperson, Lariane Jonker explains. “At about 03:00 she woke up as a result of strange sounds coming from an adjacent room in her house.  Whilst attempting to investigate, she was grabbed in the dark by an unknown male which pushed her back inside the bedroom and raped her. The suspect then fled through the bedroom window. A case of rape is being investigated and no arrests have been made yet.” Listen to related audio: <a href="https://iono.fm/e/626002">Content hosted by iono.fm</a> See related video:
