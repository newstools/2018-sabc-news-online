The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) is optimistic that the Dros rape accused will be admitted to the Weskoppies Psychiatric Hospital before the case resumes in the Pretoria Magistrate’s Court at the end of the month. On Friday, the court agreed to refer 22-year-old Nichollas Ninow for psychiatric observation. Ninow is accused of raping a seven-year-old girl at the Dros restaurant in Silverton more than a month ago. NPA spokesperson Phindi Mjonondwane says they did not oppose Ninow’s application to be referred to Weskoppies because his lawyer Riaan Du Plessis proved that his client was previously diagnosed with bipolar and that he had been abusing substances since he was young. “What we are however opposing as the State is the fact that the defence wanted additional private experts to observe the accused, and we therefore totally against that as a State. We believe that Weskoppies has experts and people who are experienced. They have compiled reports for various courts in our country before. And therefore there is totally no need at this stage to dispute a report that has not been compiled yet,” adds Mjonondwane. Click related video:
