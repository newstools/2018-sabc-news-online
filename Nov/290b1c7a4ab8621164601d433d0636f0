Two men aged 61 and 50 have been arrested in the Northern Cape in connection with the rape and impregnation of a 12-year-old Pampierstad girl. It is believed the girl, who is now pregnant, was raped over the course of a year by the two men in custody as well as a third suspect who is currently on the run. She was allegedly stalked, sexually groomed and eventually preyed on by the three men. Police spokesperson Mohale Ramatseba says, “The suspect was arrested after the Provincial Commissioner in the Northern Cape, Lieutenant General Risimati Shivuri activated a 72 hour plan… and the third suspect is being followed up and we are following leads and he will be arrested soon.”
