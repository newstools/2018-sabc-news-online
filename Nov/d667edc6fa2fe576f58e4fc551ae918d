Democratic Alliance (DA) leader Mmusi Maimane says the Gupta family’s influence goes beyond former President Jacob Zuma, and that the rest of the ANC, including President Cyril Ramaphosa himself, was not immune from it. The DA leader and his colleagues on Tuesday provided Cape Town police with what they say is additional information and evidence, for existing state capture investigations. Maimane has accused the ruling party of being culpable of state capture. He reiterated his calls for an inquiry into the Bosasa matter, saying he would write to Ramaphosa calling for this inquiry to be established immediately. This comes after the DA says it has found that the R500 000 donation from Bosasa to Ramaphosa’s election campaign was administered by a law firm whose director allegedly has links to the Guptas. “There is a system in place that’s fuelling all of these issues and our sense is that if Mr Ramaphosa himself is serious about investigating corruption, let’s set up an inquiry into Bosasa, let us ensure that the Hawks, the NPA  investigate because ultimately you can’t say the ANC must police itself.” ANC’s Head of Presidency Zizi Kodwa  says Maimane should come to the Zondo Commission if he has any credible information.
