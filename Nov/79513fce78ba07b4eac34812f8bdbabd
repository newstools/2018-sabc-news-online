Former President Jacob Zuma has filed an affidavit in the Constitutional Court claiming the Nugent Commission of Inquiry into South African Revenue Service (Sars) had no basis to recommend the firing of the former revenue services boss Tom Moyane. Zuma says it was he and not his successor Cyril Ramaphosa who called for the commission. The former President says the commission deviated from its originally intended purpose by dealing with the employment contracts of individual employees, especially where such contracts were already the specific focus of a separate Presidentially initiated process. Retired Judge Robert Nugent found that Moyane did not have the character of a person fit to lead Sars and he should be removed. Meanwhile, Moyane has since moved to fight his dismissal at the Concourt. “Our main argument is that there is double jeopardy that Mr Moyane is facing. One in the disciplinary inquiry and as well as in Sars inquiry, not only double jeopardy, now you have a third jeopardy that the issues concerning Moyane are being brought before the Zondo Commission. So in fact he is facing triple jeopardy now. We hope that the affidavit will assist the court in arriving at a just decision,” says Moyane’s Lawyer, Eric Mabuza.
