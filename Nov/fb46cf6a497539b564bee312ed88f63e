Mineral Resources Minister Gwede Mantashe has expressed concern over the Pretoria High Court Judgment on mining rights in Xolobeni, in the Eastern Cape. The court ruled that he cannot issue mining rights without consulting the communities that occupy that land.  This ruling is important for all who live in communal communities. After many years of tireless struggle & heavy sacrifices, Xolobeni Community’s right to say ‘No’, is affirmed by the Court. Thank you, @Richard_Spoor, @JohanLorenzen of Spoor Inc. for this victory.  https://t.co/ymF28VjPMk — Nomboniso Gasa (@nombonisogasa) November 22, 2018  Mantashe says the attitude towards mining will result in the country not mining at all in years to come. He believes that instead government should be forced to mine responsibly. “With the attitude towards mining in South Africa, within the next 20 to 30 years mining will be banned in this country. You see the pressures from everybody else where mining is treated as a curse rather than a blessing. It is not treated as a wealth. It is treated more from the negative as a pollutor. This is a deprivation that worries me a great deal. We should be just forced to mine responsibly.” We were in #Xolobeni over the weekend, 17 November, to meet with Amadiba Crisis Committee & their legal representatives. We have agreed to go back to #Xolobeni soon to continue with consultations. That arrangement stands. pic.twitter.com/Jh4dnZLRHu — Gwede Mantashe (@GwedeMantashe1) November 22, 2018
