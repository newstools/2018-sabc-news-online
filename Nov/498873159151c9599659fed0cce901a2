The French government says a motorist has killed a protester. The protester was part of demonstrations across France over a decision to increase the fuel price as a result of President Emmanuel Macronâ€™s increased fuel tax. The demonstrators are attempting to block motorways as well as access to fuel depots. At a blockade on a road in the southeast of the country, a driver panicked and accelerated when she saw protesters, fatally hitting a woman demonstrator. Crowds are also calling for Macron to resign.
