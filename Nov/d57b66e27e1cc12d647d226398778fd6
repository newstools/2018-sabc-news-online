Power utility Eskom says job cuts are inevitable as they are faced with a very challenging period. Eskom says it is still dealing with issues of undesired coal supply, recent strikes, financial and capacity constrains leading to minimum refurbishments and maintenance of aging infrastructure. Eskom CEO Phakamani Hadebe says they have taken firm decisions to deal with current challenges including restructuring which will lead to job losses. ” Eskom has undergone quite a trying time during the past couple of years, and its up to us those that have had the privilege to work at Eskom to do their level best to bring this institution to where it belongs. But I must say that the journey, it’s not gonna be easy, that before we turn around this huge institution it’s going to be a tough journey that demands painful decisions. We have taken a lot of measures in stabilising the institution.” Eskom has meanwhile urged consumers to use energy sparingly as it faces challenges with its electricity system. The power utility says ten power stations have less than 20 days of coal stock as per grid requirement. Hadebe says there is a recovery plan, but load-shedding cannot be ruled out.
