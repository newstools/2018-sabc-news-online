The Western Cape Education Department says it has been having on-going engagements with a group of parents at an upmarket Cape Town school, the Rustenburg Junior School for Girls, who believe the institution refuses to transform. This follows the recent controversial resignation of a black teacher at at the school. The organisation, Parents for Change has called for the school governing body to be dissolved. The teacher says the school accused her of poor performance, adding that some parents wanted her gone. The Provincial Education Department’s Bronagh Casey says,”In the last meeting held in September 2018, an agreement was reached by all parties of co-operation and that the concerned group would form part of the school governing body’s diversity subcommittee. Now while this matter is receiving public attention, the Western Cape Education Department remains committed to an on-going process of reconciling the differences between all parties and ensuring that a participative process by all interested groups takes place. We will again offer to meet shortly and recommend external specialist mediation.”
