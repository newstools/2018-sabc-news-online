A Pretoria West woman has filed a case of intimidation and assault with the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (IPID). This was after police were caught on camera assaulting, swearing and shoving the lady into the back of their van. Amber Jacobsz hopes justice will prevail. Jacobsz is a 40-year-old mechanic residing in Pretoria West. She shares her residence with a tuck shop where pupils at a local high school come to shop. Police responded to a call that the pupils were allegedly smoking dagga near her residence. Upon arrival the police allegedly assaulted her due to a misunderstanding. All this happened in view of the tuck shop manager and learners, who recorded the encounter on their cell phones. The case was opened and subsequently transferred to IPID for investigation. The two officers implicated in the alleged assault are still reporting for duty at the Pretoria West Police Station. WARNING the following visuals might offend sensitive viewers WATCH BELOW :
