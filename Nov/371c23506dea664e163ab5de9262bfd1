The High Court has heard how former Parktown Boys High school water polo coach Collan Rex was reprimanded on several occasions for engaging in improper conduct with learners. This emerged during aggravation of sentence underway at the Palm Ridge Court east of Johannesburg.  The 23-year-old was found guilty on 144 counts of sexual assault and 12 of common assault. The abuses came to light after the accused was caught on a surveillance camera allegedly fondling a 15-year-old learner in the common room of the school’s hostel in November 2016. A teacher from the Parktown Boys High School in Johannesburg says Rex was given three warnings for improper conduct with learners. Christiaan Bossert says Rex was given two warnings prior to his arrest in 2016 and a final warning when the footage of him allegedly fondling a learner came to light. Bossert says subsequent to Rex’s arrest, more than ten learners frequented his office to complain about the abuse they endured at the hands of the former water polo coach. He also said that two learners also attempted suicide, as they battled to overcome the abuse. The case continues.
