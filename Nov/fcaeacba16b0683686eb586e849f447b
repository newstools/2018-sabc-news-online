Medical staff members at the Lebowakgomo Hospital, outside Polokwane in Limpopo have expressed fear about their safety at the premises. This comes after an armed robbery at the doctors’ residence on Friday night. An environmental health inspector was assaulted and injured and the doctors’ belongings were stolen at gun-point. This is the second break-in at a doctor’s residence at a Limpopo hospital this week. On Thursday, two doctors and the wife of one of the doctors were shot and injured at the Letaba hospital. Doctor Selaelo Mphasha witnessed the Lebowakgomo robbery. “Obviously after the incident that happened at Letaba hospital, approximately 24 hours later, we are attacked here… I feel like honestly we are not safe, and I know by law we are supposed to be saving lives, but according to the law, if you feel like you are not safe you cannot save patients – so I hope they find the guys who are causing this problem.” Limpopo Health MEC ,Dr Phophi Ramathuba, says they suspect that there could be a syndicate that wants to make Limpopo unattractive to skilled medical professionals. “While we have not seen anyone who has sustained a serious physical injury here, our main concern is that until when should this continue to terrorise and threaten our staff? It makes us  conclude that yes indeed we have syndicates here to terrorise the very same skilled professionals that sacrifice and compromise to work in the rural area,” explains Ramathuba.
