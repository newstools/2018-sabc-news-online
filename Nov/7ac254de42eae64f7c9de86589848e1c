Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng has called on African leaders to play a leading role in the land issue. Mogoeng delivered the keynote address at the 14th Chief Albert Luthuli Memorial Lecture at the University of KwaZulu-Natal’s Westvile Campus in Durban earlier on Saturday. Land reform has recently dominated South Africa’s headlines, ahead of next year’s national election. Redistribution is the most important component of land reform in the country. The African National Congress (ANC) is backing expropriation without compensation. However the Democratic Alliance (DA) says this would devastate the economy because it undermines property rights. Mogoeng has emphasised that the land issue affects the whole of the African continent. “It has always been and should always be about the entire African continent. We have thus committed ourselves to the well-being of the continent. It is therefore befitting that we pour our energies and collective wisdom in endeavours that would result in sensible, humane and just land ownership patterns, sustainable and beneficial land use by all. Share prosperity and enduring peace. The major challenges that confronted almost all African countries is the land issue.” Meanwhile, the family of the late former ANC president Albert Luthuli says they believe he was killed by the apartheid government. The family says an inquest into his mysterious death is expected to start next month. Luthuli’s grandson Mthunzi Luthuli says the family needs closure – including the information on who issued an order for the assassination of Luthuli. The family and members of the community are attending the 14th  Chief Albert Luthuli memorial lecture at the University of KwaZulu-Natal Westville Campus. WATCH RELATED VIDEO:
