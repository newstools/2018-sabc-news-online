The Democratic Alliance (DA)’s James Selfe says his party taking prominent persons to court is not politically motivated. Selfe was commenting outside the North Gauteng High Court in Pretoria following the conclusion of arguments in the application of his party and the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) to review and set aside the agreement between the Presidency and former president Jacob Zuma to cover his legal costs. Zuma’s lawyer advocate Thabani Masuku told the court that the application that DA and EFF had brought was politically-motivated. However, Selfe has dismissed this,“We bring a lot of litigation to court in the public interest and the interest of our voters. We do not do so for political motives and so for the last twelve or so years we brought a number of cases. We brought a case against the appointment of Mr [Menzi] Simelane as the National Director of Public Prosecutions.” “We were not playing politics there. We were seeking to work out what is it to be a fit and proper person in that particular position. And in just the same way here we are not bringing this litigation against Mr Zuma for political purposes,” adds Selfe.
