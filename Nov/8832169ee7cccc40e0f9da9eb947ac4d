The AmaBhungane Centre for Investigative Journalism has claimed that a company that won a R1.2 billion tender to run car and truck fleets for the City of Johannesburg made payments to Julius Malema and the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF). The allegations state that the company made a bribe to the EFF to get a contract from the Democratic Alliance (DA)Â  led City and that this is how the DA and EFF have maintained a partnership. The EFF has said that there is no evidence of this. Meanwhile, Johannesburg Mayor Herman Mashaba has dismissed allegations of wrong doing in his council contained in the report by AmaBhungane and says that an investigation will be done into the matter.
