African National Congress (ANC) national chairperson Gwede Mantashe has blamed factionalism and desire to have power at all costs for the court battle brought by ANC factions in North West against the NEC. The structures and the former North West premier, Supra Mahumapelo wanted the South Gauteng High Court in Johannesburg to set aside the decision of the NEC to disband the Provincial Executive Committee (PEC). Mantashe was reacting to Friday’s ruling that the application be struck off the court roll as it was not urgent. The ANC national chairperson was speaking at the South African Communist Party (SACP)’s Red Friday event in Klerksdorp in North West. “Others are in court today. Their case has been dismissed with costs. When I was the secretary general, tomorrow, I would send them the statement and ask for the money for my senior counsel and my advocate.” “When people fight, take each other to court, because of the desire to have power, you must know there’s something that has gone wrong. And that is the function of the ANC that is no longer in the trenches of the struggle, but an ANC, where you have a position; it is linked to positions that are material,” adds Mantashe.
