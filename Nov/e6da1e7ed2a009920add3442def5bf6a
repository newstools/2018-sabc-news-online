Police Minister Bheki Cele says they have registered a 36% decline in cash-in-transit (CIT) robberies countrywide. The Minister  commended the police for their sterling work by effecting arrests on the criminals who even used explosives and heavy weapons to carry out what he calls heinous crime. Cele also lauded police investigation teams working on advocate Pete Mihalic and the Khoza family murder cases. Minister Cele says over 230 suspects involved in Cash-in-transit robberies have been arrested since the upsurge in this type of crime early this year. Cele says in many of these incidents, robbers attacked armed CIT vehicles with explosives and heavy calibre weapons leading to death and injuries to security officers. The police say most of the CIT happened in Gauteng, North West, Limpopo and Mpumalanga. “Gauteng, North West, Mpumalanga and Limpopo those were the provinces under attack then. As from the 1st of April 2018 to the 4th of November 2018, 118 CIT robberies have been recorded across the nine provinces, compared to the same period last year of 184 cases recorded. Which registering of 36% down.” Minister Cele says the arrest of criminals involved in CIT can be attributed to the police and intelligence service joint work. He says the successful police operation was based on 72-hour operative plan.
