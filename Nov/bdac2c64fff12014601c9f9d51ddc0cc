Chaos broke out at the Nelson Mandela Bay Metro Council meeting between members of the public and the sheriff who was at the council meeting to serve three Democratic Alliance (DA) Councillors with papers. The members of the public involved in the scuffle were wearing African National Congress (ANC) and United Democratic Movement (UDM) t-shirts. They questioned the presence of the sheriff and his serving of the papers in council and not at their homes. Amongst the Councillors that were going to be served is Mbulelo Manyathi. He abstained during voting in a previous council meeting that saw the DA losing administration of the metro in August. It is unclear what the papers contained as they were torn apart during the scuffle. The special council meeting is expected to discuss the future of the suspended city manager, Johann Mettler, and the appointment of an acting city manager. It is a closed meeting.
