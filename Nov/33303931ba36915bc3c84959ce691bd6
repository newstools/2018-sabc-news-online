South African Policing Union (Sapu) says police suicide is one of the biggest challenges that the organisation is still facing. Just last week an officer murdered his wife then turned the gun on himself in full view of people at a police station in Hout Bay Cape Town. And since Parliament’s Portfolio Committee on police has raised concerns about the high number of police suicides early this year, even more cases have been reported. SAPS’ Brigadier Petunia Lenono says, “Police suicide is one of the biggest challenges that the organisation is still facing. We are on a three year basis conduct an analysis to determine whether the stats have increased or decreased and we have found that in the past three years it has sort of like remained constant.” The union insists that the rate of these incidents will only decrease once Employee Assistance programs are improved and when psychological debriefing is mandatory in the service.
