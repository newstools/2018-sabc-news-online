Cosatu in the Western Cape says it plans to appeal the court decision to close Uitsig High School in Elsies River. The High Court in Cape Town last week ruled in favour of the Western Cape Education Department, after the school governing body brought a court application to challenge the Provincial Minister’s decision to close the school. Minister Debbie Schäfer decided in March last year that it was in the best interest of the learners to close the school after the school building had been declared unsafe. About 100 learners will be moved to nearby schools where there are better facilities and resources. Cosatu Provincial Secretary, Malvern de Bruyn, says the department is abdicating its responsibility to fix the school. “So we will instruct our lawyer advocate Norman Arendse to start with the paper work so that we can appeal the outcome of the judgment. There is a need for a school in Uitsig, there are currently three primary schools in the area and they want to take the only high school away so that’s our concern.” Watch related video:
