The South African National AIDS Council (SANAC) says it is encouraged by government’s efforts on the decriminalisation of sex work in the country. The organisation say they are working with the department of Justice on the matter. The council has been responding to a question about the impact of decriminalisation of sex work in the country’s HIV response at a meeting reviewing the country’s HIV/TB Strategic Plan in Johannesburg. There’ve been a number of calls for government to decriminalise sex work in the country. The CEO of SANAC Doctor Sandile Buthelezi says, “We have been involved in a number of things including the parliamentary women’s caucus where we were invited to do our own presentations on how we would like to see decriminalisation. The Justice and Constitutional Development ministry is working on that. I’m very hopeful, I was very impressed, though we are not sure which route that it might take but we are very hopeful, the fact that the parliament put together a caucus to work on that, that on its own shows that there is a light at the end of the tunnel.” I support the decriminalisation of sex work: Deputy Police minister
