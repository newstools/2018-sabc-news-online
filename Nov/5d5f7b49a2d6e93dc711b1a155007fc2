Ethiopian President Sahle-Work Zewde says her country will work hard to maintain SABC News Foreign Editor Sophie Mokoena on the sidelines of the Africa Investment Forum in Sandton, on Thursday. Zwede also spoke about her new role and says her country has made progress in appointing women to key leadership positions. The former diplomat replaces Mulatu Teshome Wirtu, who tendered his resignation to parliament last month. The presidentâ€™s post is a ceremonial one in Ethiopia. The prime minister, who is the head of state, holds executive power. Sahle-Work becomes the fourth President since the ruling EPRDF coalition came to power.
