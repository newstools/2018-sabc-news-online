Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan will continue with his testimony at the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture in Johannesburg on Tuesday. On Monday, he told the commission about disagreements with former president Jacob Zuma during his two terms as finance minister. Gordhan asked the commission to investigate the plans for a nuclear deal. He says in his first term as Finance Minister he was asked by Zuma to approve a guarantee for PetroSA to purchase a stake in Engen from a Malaysian oil company. “I wanted to impress upon the former president that undertaking the nuclear procurement required careful consideration of its costs, the choice of supplier, due process and the likely challenges to any decision to proceed,” says Gordhan. Both Tom Moyane, former SARS commissioner and former NPA Shaun Abrahams have indicated they intend to cross examine Gordhan. Watch commission hearings below:
