African National Congress (ANC) Deputy President David Mabuza is leading the party’s Thuma Mina election campaign at Mkhondo, formerly Piet Retief in Mpumalanga. Mabuza has not been seen in public for the past few weeks. The deputy president had been booked off for sick leave. On Sunday, Mabuza conducted a door to door campaign in Thandukukhanya township. Later on, the Deputy President is expected to meet with residents at a local sports field to discuss service delivery issues. The ANC has taken its Thuma Mina election campaign to the Mpumalanga province. Senior ANC members are visiting different parts of the province, over the weekend to interact with residents, regarding service delivery issues. On Saturday, some National Executive Committee (NEC) and National Working Committee (NWC) members engaged with residents of Mkhuhlu, at a local sports field. The ANC NEC and NWC members also visited Mkhuhlu in the Bushbuckridge local municipality. Led by NEC members Naledi Pandor and Senzo Mchunu, they proceeded to the local shopping complex to remind residents about ANC values. They assured the community that the ANC is in a rebuilding phase. The party leadership told the residents that the ANC needs support more than ever before. They pleaded with the voters to continue supporting the party. They also shared their views on the Bosasa issue, involving President Cyril Ramaphosa. Pandor said Ramaphosa did a good thing by writing to the Speaker of Parliament admitting to an error he made during an oral reply to questions in Parliament.
