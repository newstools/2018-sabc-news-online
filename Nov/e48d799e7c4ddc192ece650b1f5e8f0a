The Eastern Cape government aims to reduce HIV/AIDS infections and trace patients who have defaulted on their treatment. It’s launched a massive campaign ahead of World Aids Day on the 1st December. 43 000 people are defaulting on their HIV/Aids medication in the Nelson Mandela Bay Metro in the Eastern Cape. Tracking them and encouraging others to get tested is a priority in the municipality. The target is to have an Aids-free South Africa by 2030. Acting Premier Dr Pumza Dyantyi says” yes, we have done so many campaigns but our challenge of people who keep on defaulting and this is a major challenge for us as government but response has been good and we are going to work sleepless nights to make sure we realise our dream.” Seven-point-five million people are currently living with HIV/ AIDS in the country. As part of the campaign there are 20 teams of 600 foot soldiers going door to door. Providing information and encouraging testing. The initiative was welcomed by civil society. Eastern Cape AIDS Council Melikhaya Lusiti says, “we welcome this but there is so much work to be done to create awareness as people are still ignorant, stigma is another challenge facing government but we are heading to the right direction.” The campaign will also visit other areas in the province.  Statistics show that 40 per cent of people aren’t aware of their status.
