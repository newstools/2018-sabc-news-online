President Cyril Ramaphosa says the government is considering the introduction of a national registry for protection orders as a measure to protect victims of gender-based violence. He was addressing over 2000 delegates at the presidential summit on gender-based violence in Pretoria on Thursday. The President says this is part of an effective and coordinated response to gender violence that the government is planning.  “Protection orders can be obtained in terms of the Domestic Violence Act, but very often survivors have to flee to other parts of the country where it becomes difficult to obtain copies of these orders without going through another whole process again.  We should examine the possibility of introducing a national registry for protection orders, “ says Ramaphosa. He further says the nation needs to rally together to find solutions to gender-based violence. National plan The Speaker of national assembly Baleka Mbete says the government is ready to announce its national plan in response to combating incidents of gender-based violence. Mbete urged those in judicial positions not to fail the victims of abuse by not implementing laws aimed at ending the scourge of violence on women and children. Delegates attending the two summit include activists of Gender based violence groups, traditional leaders, UN Women representatives and NGOs. Click link for more
