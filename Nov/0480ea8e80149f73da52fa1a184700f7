The Mazda Motor Corporation (Mazda) on Thursday said that it planned to recall around 640 000 vehicles globally to fix issues including a problem with the valve springs used in its diesel engines. The Japanese automaker said it would recall around 230 000 vehicles at home and a total of 410 000 units in overseas markets excluding the United States, where the automaker does not sell diesel models. Mazda’s recall comes after domestic rival, Subaru Corporation, stated last week that it would recall 400,000 vehicles globally to fix a design flaw in the valve springs used in its engines, costs for which would consume into the automaker’s full-year profit. Japanese automakers are dealing with a rise in quality issues ranging from faulty components to testing misconduct, which are increasing costs and raising questions about quality controls.
