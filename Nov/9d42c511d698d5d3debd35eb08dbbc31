Sentencing procedures in the trial of former property mogul Jason Rohde have been postponed to December 5 in the High Court in Cape Town. Rohde was convicted two weeks ago for the murder of his wife at the Spier Wine Estate near Stellenbosch in 2016. The defence told the court that it needed more time to consult with Rohde’s daughters who will be witnesses in mitigation of sentence. Defence advocate, Abraham van der Spuy argued that he needed more time to consult with experts like a psychologist and Rohde’s friend, who had agreed to testify about his good character. Rohde’s bail of R1 million has been revoked. Related Video
