Forty-seven people have been killed in a bus crash in Zimbabwe. Two buses collided last night on a road between the capital Harare and the eastern town of Rusape. Road crashes are common in Zimbabwe, where roads are riddled with potholes due to years of under funding and neglect, but the highway where the crash occurred had been recently resurfaced. SABC News will bring you more information on the story later.
