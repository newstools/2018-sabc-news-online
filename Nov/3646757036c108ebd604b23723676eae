Three men have appeared in the Taung Magistrate’s Court in the North West, in connection with several rapes of a 12-year-old girl. Sixty one-year-old Gaolatlwe Tsienyane, 56-year-old Ruele Matlhola and 20-year-old Tshiamo Motsage were arrested over the weekend on allegations of stalking, sexually grooming and eventually raping the child. The family of the girl discovered this after she was found to have fallen pregnant. The girl turned 13 on Tuesday.  The trio’s next court appearance is expected to be in the Kgomotso Magistrate’s Court next week, where they’ll apply for legal representation. They have been remanded in custody. The mother of the child is calling on the court to deny the three suspects bail. “I don’t want them to get bail. These people have ruined her future. They should stay in jail and get their sentences while in jail. I want them to rot in jail,” says the mother. Meanwhile, community leader Thapelo Matshwe says men must stand up against the abuse of women and children. “Our children must be protected by us, it’s high time that men take a stand and fight these kind of things,” says Matshwe.
