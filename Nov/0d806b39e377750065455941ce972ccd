Lobby group, AfriForum says it maintains that it wants the High Court in Cape Town to halt the debate on the Constitutional Committee’s report on Section 25 of the constitution. The report, which was adopted more than a week ago, recommends that Section 25 be amended to make provisions for the expropriation of land without compensation. The National Assembly Programme Committee rescheduled the debate to be held on December 4. The Committee’s report was initially expected to be brought before both houses of parliament for debate and final approval this Tuesday. AfriForum’s legal representative, Willie Spies says, “At this stage, the purpose of the application is (that) we ask that the debate should be postponed until after the judicial review process has been finalised. That’s the position at the moment, and the matter will be dealt with in court – and I cannot give the details of what is in court but the matter will be heard this coming Monday.” Watch related videos:
