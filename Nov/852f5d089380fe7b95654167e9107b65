Parliament’s Ethics Committee will no longer proceed with a disciplinary hearing against former Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba. This follows his resignation as an MP on Thursday. Various political parties have welcomed Gigaba’s decision to resign as an MP. Malusi Gigaba first resigned as a Cabinet Minister on Tuesday and he’s now thrown in the towel as an MP. Gigaba first became a Member of Parliament in 1999. He resigned in 2001 but was re-elected again following 2004 elections. Gigaba was then appointed Deputy Home Affairs Minister. In 2010, he became Public Enterprises Minister until 2014. This was followed by a shift to the Home Affairs Portfolio, until he was appointed Finance Minister in March 2017. He stayed at National Treasury for just under a year until he was sent back to Home Affairs in February this year. Gigaba’s resignations came amid court findings that he lied under oath and also broke the Executive Ethics Code. He was facing a disciplinary hearing, which would have proceeded had he stayed on in Parliament. Opposition parties welcomed his resignation. Watch reactions below:
