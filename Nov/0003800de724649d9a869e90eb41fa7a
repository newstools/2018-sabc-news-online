The Knysna Animal Welfare Society (KAWS) has made an urgent plea for donations to care for more than 150 animals rescued during the recent veld fires in the area. KAWS Manager Annelien Kitley says most animals, including 78 dogs, 11 cats, 46 chickens and 17 pigs, are from the Karatara, Farleigh and Diepwalle areas. She says they will have to take care of the animals from Farleigh for at least another two weeks, as many of the residents’ houses burnt down. “That night we got 12 animals, we got 8 pigs from there. We’re looking after them at the back, we’re in desperate need of food for the pigs and chicks. We’ve got 65 chicks on the premises, we’re in desperate need of food. We would like the people to phone us and come forward, they must surely wonder where they are.” Eight people have been killed and hundreds have been forced to evacuate their homes due to the fires which started over two weeks ago. The causes of the fires is still unknown.
