Police have been deployed to Stutterheim in the Eastern Cape to monitor a protest after protesters allegedly set two trucks alight. Last month, residents of Mlungisi township torched four buildings including a clinic during protests over alleged nepotism and maladministration in the Amahlathi Local Municipality. Residents say authorities have been ignoring their demands. Police spokesperson, Siphokazi Mawisa, says officers are investigating a case of malicious damage to property. “Two vehicles have been set alight by protesters and the N6 road has been only opened for small vehicles as the big vehicles cannot pass due to those two trucks that are yet not towed away. A case of malicious damaged has been opened,” states Mawisa.
