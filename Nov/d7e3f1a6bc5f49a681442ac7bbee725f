A 43-year-old Congolese prophet, William Emeka, of God is Love Ministries, is expected to appear in the Bronkhorstspruit Magistrateâ€™s Court on Thursday morning. He is facing charges of sexually assaulting several women in his church. It is alleged that Emeka would propose that he pray for them in private whenever they had problems. His arrest sparked outrage among residents of Rethabiseng township, resulting in his church building being burnt down last weekend. Members of the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) members and the community are expected to turnout in their numbers.
