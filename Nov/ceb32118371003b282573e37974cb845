Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan will on Wednesday continue to testify at the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture in Parktown, Johannesburg. On Tuesday, he spent time detailing his limited interactions with the Gupta family and what he considers to have been the process of State Capture. He also hit back at those – including the EFF – who demanded that he be fired, claiming he created a conducive environment for State Capture during his tenure as the Minister of Finance. Day three of Pravin Gordhan’s testimony will see more former senior officials at the Department of Finance being called to give evidence. He has assured the commission that there was no way he would have allowed few individuals to loot State funds and resources for personal gains. Gordhan is scheduled to give evidence for a short time on Wednesday morning and make way for former Director-General at the Finance Department, Lungisa Fuzile. Related Video:
