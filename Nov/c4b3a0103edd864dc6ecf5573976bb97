The Commission of Inquiry into State Capture will on Friday hear testimony from the Director-General of the National Treasury, Dondo Mogajane. His testimony comes after two days of explosive evidence from former DG, Lungisa Fuzile who told the commission how bad the situation was, including the performance of the rand when former Finance Minister Nhlanhla Nene was fired and replaced by Des Van Rooyen in December 2015. Fuzile told the commission he suffered what he termed “bullying” by Van Rooyen, who in his few days as a minister was already making demands from him. Fuzile described how the rand plunged, immediately after Nene was fired. Following his appointment, Van Rooyen appeared clueless of what role he was to play at the Department of Finance. Fuzile says what shocked him was that even before he took office, an advisor was already appointed and that was an illegal move. Click links for more
