Residents from Delmore Park and Jerusalem informal settlements in Boksburg, east of Johannesburg, have blocked off Commissioner Street, a major route, with stones and burning tyres. The two sides are in conflict over the illegal use of electricity. Police spokesperson Nathi Mokwana says the residents are waiting for the Mayor and relevant MMC to come and address them. Mokwana says, “Jerusalem people have disconnected the electricity for the Delmore Park people, reason being they’d rather be all in the dark then to have one person having electricity or one side of the community having electricity and the others don’t have electricity. So right now people of Delmore Park wrote a petition requesting the attention of the mayor and the MMC to come and address them. Currently everything is still under control, no injuries, no shots fired.”
