Anti-government protesters in Prague are holding a rally against the Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis who has denied allegations that his had his own son kidnapped. The aim was supposedly to stop him from testifying that his father had defrauded the European Union, which Babis also denies. Czech opposition parties have sought a no-confidence vote against his government, which is expected to be held on November the 23rd. The BBC’s Rob Cameron reports. “A criminal investigation into claims Mr Babis had fraudulently obtained EU business funds has stalled. Partly because police have been unable to question his adult son. But two journalists managed to track him down in Switzerland. Last year he says he was whisked out of the country by one of Mr Babis’s employees and held in russian-occupied crimea. Mr babis who denies the EU fraud allegations says that too is untrue, his son had been diagnosed with schizophrenia and had left eh country to convalesce away from the glare of the Czech media,” reports British Broadcasting Corporation BBC Rob Cameron.
