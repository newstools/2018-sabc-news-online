A Gauteng taxi driver, who was previously convicted of 43 rape and kidnapping charges in the High Court in Johannesburg, will be sentenced in a separate case in the Roodepoort Regional Court on Tuesday. Lebogang Mokoena is expected to be sentenced for one charge of kidnapping, one of rape and two of robbery with aggravating circumstances. He was convicted after he pleaded guilty two months ago. The sentencing had to be postponed after the charge sheet went missing. The charge sheet had to be retyped and the matter is expected to be back in court. The two men were driving their notorious Toyota Quantum minibus taxi when the two passengers boarded it. The women was with her 19-year-old son along Ontdekkers Road in Florida, west of Johannesburg. Inside the taxi Mokoena produced a cigarette lighter, which resembled a firearm and pointed it at the adult woman. He then raped the woman in the presence of her son while his friend drove the taxi. After raping the woman, Mokoena robbed them of their belongings and demanded the PIN to her bank card before dropping them off. The accused spent more than R19 000 of her money, buying alcohol and groceries, among other goods. In a separate matter to be heard in the South Gauteng High Court sitting in Palm Ridge Mokoena is also expected to be sentenced. He faces 13 counts of rape, nine of kidnapping, nine of robbery with aggravating circumstances, nine of pointing an object that resembles a firearm, two of aiding and abetting someone to commit an offence and one of sexual assault.
