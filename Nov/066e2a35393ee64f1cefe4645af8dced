The former head of Government Communication and Information System (GCIS) Mzwanele Manyi, says he wants a formal, public apology from former Public Enterprises Minister Barbara Hogan. This after Hogan testified at the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture on Tuesday, on details surrounding former Eskom CEO Jacob Maroga’s resignation in 2009. Hogan had in the past named Manyi as one of a group from trade union, National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (Numsa), who were once at Maroga’s office. But Hogan clarified at the commission that this was not the case. Manyi was speaking on the side-lines of the inquiry in Parktown, Johannesburg. “She withdrew the mention and the outstanding part is an apology and I seek an apology from her. I really think this is part of a strategy that some of us are being named dropped every time in these commissions just to taint our names.” “This is a well-orchestrated strategy, a deliberate act that was done with the hope that I was going to ignore it. So, Barbara Hogan must apologise for lying under oath which was written. She can make a public apology. She is still coming here and can do it at the same platform where she was tabling her mischievous utterance. She can even issue a statement,” adds Manyi.
