The mother of Cheslin Marsh has described the torment her family suffered as a result of the vicious attack on her son – at the Stellenbosch University in May last year. She is testifying in aggravation of sentence in the murder trial of Stellenbosch student, Hannah Cornelius in the High Court in Cape Town. The four accused were yesterday convicted on charges of murder, attempted murder and rape. “Marilyn Marsh was very emotional as she told the High Court how helpless she felt when she saw her child in hospital. Cheslin was severely assaulted, stabbed and left for dead in May last year when he and 21 year old Cornelius were hijacked and kidnapped on campus. Cornelius was raped and murdered. Looking at the four convicted men, she said she asked herself what kind of people would do such a thing. Vernon Witbooi, Geraldo Parsons and Eben van Niekerk were found guilty of the rape and murder of Cornelius and the attempted murder of Marsh. The fourth accused, Nashville Julius, was found guilty of robbery with aggravated circumstances.”
