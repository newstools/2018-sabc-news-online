The social security agency Sassa has appealed to social grant recipients, who still use the old card, to apply for the new gold Sassa card before the end of December 2018. It says this is extremely important as beneficiaries will not be able to access their grants in January 2019 with the old white Sassa card. Sassa spokesperson, Paseka Letsatsi says they are worried about the high number of those who still haven’t changed their cards. Letsatsi says the are about 400 000 beneficiaries who still have the old white Sassa card. He says: “We want to appeal to everybody who has not changed their cards that they must come forward before the end of December, because if they don’t do that unfortunately those still with the old Sassa card won’t be able to get their grants come January.” Related Video
