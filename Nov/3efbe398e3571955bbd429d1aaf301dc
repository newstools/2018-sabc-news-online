Members of Black First Land First (BLF) have gathered outside the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture in Parktown, Johannesburg – accusing Pravin Gordhan of being an accomplice to Gupta activities while he was Finance Minister. Gordhan, who’s now Public Enterprises Minister, is due to testify at the commission on Monday. He earlier admitted that he had met with the controversial Gupta family at the request of former president, Jacob Zuma. EFF members are expected to join the BLF in protesting at the inquiry against what they call Gordhan’s role in state capture. BLF deputy president Zanele Lwana says, “Pravin Gordhan is conflicted, he should not be in government, he should not have been allowed to be the Finance Minister and now the Public Enterprises Minister. It means that under his leadership we are going to see the swift privatisation of the SOEs in this country like SAA, like with Eskom being sabotaged and the agendas of the IPPs are being pushed and demonising the nuclear agenda which is way cheaper.” Watch State Capture Inquiry
