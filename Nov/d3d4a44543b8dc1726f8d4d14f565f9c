The bail application of two men accused of the murder of seven family members in Vlakfontein, south of Johannesburg, will on Thursday resume in the Protea Magistrate’s Court in Soweto. The matter has been transferred to the main court following the non-availability of the Lenasia Court that will be on recess for two weeks. Ernest Mabaso and Fita Khupe face seven counts of murder. Mabaso faces additional charges of theft, robbery and three counts of rape. Three women and four children were found murdered and their bodies buried in a heap of sand at their home in Vlakfontein last month. Magistrate Maggie van der Merwe says: “Court would be closed for the next two weeks. I’m afraid I am left with very little choice, I have to follow the law. Therefore I will be transferring this matter to the main court. There are numerous courts there and I’m fully aware that a lot of those courts can accommodate this. They are not as over crowded as the Lenasia courts.”
