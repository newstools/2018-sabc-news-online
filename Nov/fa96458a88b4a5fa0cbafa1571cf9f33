Civic organisation, AfriForum, has filed court papers to interdict National Assembly Speaker Baleka Mbete over the process of the Constitutional Review Committee to expropriate land without compensation. This comes almost a week after the committee adopted a report which recommends that Section 25 of the Constitution be amended to facilitate the process. House Chairperson of Committees, Cedrick Frolick, has confirmed to SABC News in Parliament that AfriForum wants to interdict the process. Frolick says Parliament is busy preparing its court papers to respond to AfriForum. The matter will be heard in the High Court in Cape Town. The report, which was adopted last week, is expected to be debated in both Houses of Parliament next week for final approval. Watch related video below:
