Residents of Alexandra north of Johannesburg are hopeful that their daily frustrations at the local offices of the  South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) will finally be adequately addressed following President Cyril Ramaphosa‘s intervention. The President paid a surprise visit to the Sassa offices earlier on Thursday.  He was accompanied by Social Development Minister Susan Shabangu. Hundreds of residents complained about poor service delivery which they said was coupled with a bad attitude from staff members. Residents say toilets are not working and there is a shortage of personnel to help them.
