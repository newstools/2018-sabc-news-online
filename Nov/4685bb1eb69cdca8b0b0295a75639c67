The city of Cape Town has threatened to disconnect solar panels if residents do not comply to register their rooftop solar photovoltaic (PV) installations. The City has threatened to disconnect solar panels due to electrical faults. Residents who do not comply to register their rooftop solar photovoltaic (PV) installations will be fined with R 6 425.90 which is the normal fine for tampering with an electrical meter. This includes both grid-tied and off-grid solar PV systems but does not apply to solar water heaters. Mayoral Committee Member for informal settlements, water and waste services, and energy, Xanthea Limberg explains that the registration and declaration process is a safety measure in case of electrical issues and would become a requirement across South Africa. “This is not about trying to penalise people, but it is about trying to get ahead of upcoming legislation but most importantly trying to ensure as a grid operator – we can guarantee safety from a network’s perspective as well as an individual household’s perspective.” Registration is free and can be done on the city’s website.
