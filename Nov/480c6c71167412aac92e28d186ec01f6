Parents of the more than 50 Soweto learners who accused a former guard at their school of sexually molesting them, say justice must be served. This comes after the accused Johannes Molefe‘s case was postponed to Wednesday, due to the nonavailability of a courtroom. He appeared in the high court sitting in the Palm Ridge Magistrate’s Court on Gauteng’s East Rand. Molefe faces three counts of rape and eleven of sexual assault. He has been in custody since October last year. Phindile Senye speaks on behalf of the learner’s parents, “Ja, they are coping because we’ve been assisted by social workers from different institutions. The Teddy Bear Clinic has done a wonderful job in terms of the assessment, the consultation and court preparation for the kids.” See related video:
