SABC News has reliably learnt that Parliament’s Portfolio Committee on Communication has cancelled Tuesday’s interviews to fill vacancies on the SABC board after three shortlisted candidates pulled out. There were 12 candidates who were shortlisted to fill four vacancies on the public broadcaster’s board. The positions were left vacant by resignation of former members last year. The three candidates who withdrew are understood to have a background in chartered accountancy. It is unclear how this will affect the process of finding suitable replacements for the vacancies on the SABC board. Related Video
