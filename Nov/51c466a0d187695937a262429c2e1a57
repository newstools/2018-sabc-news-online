Two Johannesburg firefighters injured during the fatal Bank of Lisbon building fire in the city’s CBD are expected to be discharged from Milpark hospital on Monday. Moleko Bereng and Livhuwani Maumela suffered burn wounds while battling the blaze in which three of their colleagues were killed and several others injured two months ago. The building, which housed three Gauteng government departments, was found to be only 21% compliant in terms of the occupational health and safety standards. Johannesburg Emergency Services spokesperson Nana Radebe says, “The two firefighters will be discharged today. This is after a number of operations on their burnt hands. They are part of the eight that were taken to hospital when the fire at the Bank of Lisbon broke out.”
