Agang Parliamentary leader Andries Tlouamma has written to National Assembly Speaker Baleka Mbete to request a debate of National Importance on what he calls the EFF’s ongoing scathing attacks on the media. The request for the debate comes after the South African National Editors’ Forum Sanef requested a meeting with EFF leader Julius Malema to discuss the utterances he made against some journalists recently. The EFF however says it cannot meet with Sanef because it is preparing for the 2019 national elections. Tlouamma invoked National Assembly Rule 130 which makes provision for debates of National Importance. In his letter to the Speaker, he says the matter is very serious, considering the killing of journalists worldwide. Malema has accused some journalists, especially in the main stream media, of biased reporting and failing to publish negative stories when it comes to President Cyril Ramaphosa and Minister Pravin Gordhan,  despite the two facing serious allegations. Malema has further accused some journalists of being politicians masquerading as journalists. He also accused some media houses of serving the interests of what he terms, white monopoly capital. Tlouamma says he hopes that Mbete will approve his request to have a debate before the National Assembly will be rising for the December recess next Thursday. Agang’s request below:
