British Prime Minister Theresa May said on Sunday the next seven days in the Brexit process would be critical for the country’s future. “These next seven days are going to be critical, they are about the future of this country,” May told Sky News. She said that as far as she was aware, a formal challenge to her leadership had not yet gained enough support to trigger a confidence vote for a formal leadership contest. “A change of leadership at this point isn’t going to make the negotiations any easier and it’s not going to change the parliamentary arithmetic,” she said. She added the government “would come back with their proposals for what the next step was” if they lost the final vote. Meanwhile, Britain’s opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said that a second Brexit referendum was an option for the future. He said the Labour party will not support Prime Minister Theresa May’s Brexit agreement in an upcoming vote in parliament and some in the party have backed calls for a referendum on the deal. “It’s an option for the future but it’s not an option for today because if we had a referendum tomorrow, what’s it going to be on? What’s the question going to be?” Corbyn told British broadcaster Sky News. More than two years after the United Kingdom voted to leave the EU, it is still unclear how, on what terms or even if it will leave as planned on March 29, 2019.
