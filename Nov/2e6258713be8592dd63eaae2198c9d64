SABC board member Mathatha Tsedu has painted a bleak picture of the public broadcaster’s financial situation saying it will soon be completely impossible to pay salaries. The SABC’s consultative process on the possible retrenchment of 981 permanent staff members and the non-renewal of SABC  contracts of 1200 freelancers started in Johannesburg on Tuesday. The 60-day process will involve SABC management, the workers unions Mwasa, Communication Workers Union (CWU) and Broadcasting, Electronic, Media & Allied Workers Union (Bemawu) and other stakeholders. This is in line with Section 189 of the Labour Relations Act. The CCMA will facilitate the process. Tsedu appeared before Parliament’s Communications Committee. “We are now in phase two and phase three is the extreme one and as far as we can see in terms of the revenues that are coming in and the projections that we have, at the end of January, we will get to a point where we will be able to pay salaries and a few other things. February, we might not even be able to pay full salaries. March, it’s our day zero if nothing happens” says Tsedu. READ PRESENTATION BELOW:
