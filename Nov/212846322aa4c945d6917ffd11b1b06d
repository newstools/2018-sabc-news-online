Former South African Revenue Service (SARS) Commissioner,Tom Moyane, has filed an urgent court application to overturn President Cyril Ramaphosaâ€™s decision to fire him. President Ramaphosa earlier refused a demand from Moyane to reverse his termination of service as head of the SARS. This came after Moyane, who had been suspended earlier, continued to fight the disciplinary process against him as well as the SARS Commission of Inquiry into a R100 billion irregularity in revenue collection over the last four years during his tenure.
