The City of Ekurhuleni in Gauteng is appealing to those who have applied for new IDs to collect them as soon as possible, so that they can register to vote during the voter registration period on 26 and 27 January 2019. This is in light of a big number of uncollected IDs nationally. Recent figures released by the Department of Home Affairs indicate that there are over 19Â 000 Smart IDs and 1500 green bar-coded IDs that are left uncollected in Ekurhuleni in Gauteng. Ekurhuleni Metro spokesperson, Themba Radebe says as part of its partnership with the department, the municipality is providing transport to elderly residents, people living with disabilities, learners, as well as military veterans, to encourage them to collect their IDs.
