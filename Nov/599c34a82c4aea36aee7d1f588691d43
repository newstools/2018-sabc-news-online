Eskom’s Chief Operating Officer, Jan Oberholzer, says there will not be any load shedding in the foreseeable future. He appeared before Parliament’s Public Enterprise committee to discuss the power utility’s report for the 2017/2018 financial year. Oberholzer told the committee that although coal stock piles are not at an acceptable level, there is no indication that it would be necessary to implement load shedding this week or the foreseeable future. “We don’t foresee, touch wood, at this point in time, depending on the availability of the system, having load shedding at all this week. And we don’t foresee at this point in time any load shedding.” Meanwhile, Eskom CEO, Phakamani Hadebe, says he is not aware of the involvement of Public Enterprise Minister, Pravin Gordhan, or his family members, with regards to Independent Power Producing companies doing business with government. Hadebe also appeared before Parliament’s Public Enterprises committee. He reacted to a question by Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) Member of Parliament Godrich Gardee, on whether Gordhan’s family members were benefiting from IPPs or its subsidiaries. Click video below:
