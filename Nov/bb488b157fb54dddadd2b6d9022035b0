Energy Minister Jeff Radebe says the President of the Republic, Cyril Ramaphosa remains deeply concerned about the plight of the poor and the working class, hence he continues to address issues such as fuel hikes and the VAT increase. Radebe was addressing thousands of African National Congress (ANC) members in Gauteng who marched to the Union Buildings over the scrapping of e-tolls in the province, the increase of fuel hikes and data prices amongst others. The ANC Gauteng is demanding that national government scraps the controversial e-tolls before next year’s general elections. Alliance partners, Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) and South African Communist Party (SACP), together with the Organisation of Undoing Tax Abuse (Outa) were also part of the march. Radebe has promised to give Ramaphosa the memorandum at the ANC NEC meeting on Saturday. “I have listened attentively to everybody who has spoken in this march. I’m going to be thuma’d (sent) to go back to him to present this memorandum. Fortunately tomorrow (Saturday) there is a special meeting of the NEC, here in Pretoria.  I’ll have an opportunity to hand over this memorandum to him. The ANC and its government are a very listening organisation. We have heard you.”
