President Cyril Ramaphosa and the ANC National Executive Committee (NEC) will embark on several campaigns across the Eastern Cape over the weekend. The party leadership will be embarking on door-to-door visits to encourage eligible voters to register to vote in next year’s elections. The visits which form part of the Thuma Mina Campaign are also aimed at identifying challenges faced by ordinary people in the Eastern Cape. Members of the NEC will be visiting all the ruling party’s regions including Nelson Mandela Bay and Buffalo City. The ANC’s provincial spokesperson Gift Ngqondi says the President and the NEC are on a trail to visit provinces. They started in the Free State then Gauteng and now this weekend they are in the Eastern Cape. Ngqondi says: “As part of the Thuma Mina programme, the NEC will identify challenges affecting communities and try to intervene. The President will also be doing door to door visits in most parts of Mdantsane to look at the challenges faced by the people and also encourage first time voters to go out and vote.”
