Duncan village residents, in East London in the Eastern Cape say they have not lost hope of a better future. This despite their appalling living conditions. Telecommunications deputy minister, Stella Ndabeni Abrahams, visited the area to see the conditions under which they live.
She has been visiting child headed households and elderly women. Mzwandile Toto lives in a shack. His home was struck by a tree, a few months ago. Like many in the area, Mzwandile is unemployed and cannot afford to replace the collapsed roof. The deputy minister has committed to buying the necessary material for him to put a roof over his head. This initiative is part of bringing government services closer to the people.
