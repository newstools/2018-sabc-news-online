Paddy Kearney It is with shock and sadness for us to pay tribute and bid farewell to Patrick Paddy Kearney whom we have known for almost forty years as a director at DIAKONIA in Durban, and also as a leader and a friend pic.twitter.com/4TmRxMglwV — Dr Zweli Mkhize (@DrZweliMkhize) November 24, 2018  Kearney frequently provided shelter for fleeing activists during apartheid. He closely interacted with the late Winnie Madikizela-Mandela and Prof Fatima Meer. The cleric wrote a book on Archbishop Hurley’s letters. Kearney was awarded a special medal by Pope Francis recognising his services to the Catholic Church over several decades. He promoted the idea of a just society, serving the poorest and most marginalised citizens. Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs Dr Zweli Mkhize described Kearney as a kind, quiet and soft spoken person with a warm and generous spirit who had a vision for a non-racial and transformed nation. Mkhize adds that Kearney was a giant of the liberation movement in KwaZulu-Natal. Paddy was a giant who epitomized a nonracial future and unity of our people determined to transform society to usher in a united caring and compassionate South African nation. #PaddyKearney — Dr Zweli Mkhize (@DrZweliMkhize) November 24, 2018  WATCH RELATED VIDEO BELOW:
