Former SARS commissioner Tom Moyane has lost a Constitutional Court bid to set aside the decision to establish the Nugent Commission of Inquiry. Early in November President Cyril Ramaphosa fired Moyane, who was under suspension. The presidency said Ramaphosa had accepted the recommendation of the Chairperson of the SARS Commission of inquiry, retired judge Robert Nugent, to axe Moyane. Moyane was suspended in March following a string of controversies over his running of the organisation. Nugent recommended his dismissal in an interim report on the inquiry in October. HeÂ also recommended that a permanent Commissioner be appointed for the revenue service. Mark Kingon has been acting as SARS commissioner. Related video click below:
