Gender Based Violence (GBV) activists have called the government, in particular the Presidency, to consider reviewing certain laws in order to protect victims of gender based violence. They also want transformation of the judiciary. Activists were given a platform to relate their harrowing stories of abuse – ranging from incidents of being gang raped to assault by partners – to ill treatment by police and at medical institutions. The two day summit seeks to find solutions to curb the scourge of gender-based violence. Women at the event have broken out in a thunderous roar, chanting ‘release her now’ and ‘release Martha’ calling for the Department of Justice to release Martha Marumo from prison. This after she shared her story of domestic violence at the summit in Pretoria. Marumo noted that after years of abuse she killed her husband, and is currently serving a life sentence at Kgosi Mampuru Prison in Pretoria. The summit brings together over a thousand delegates from various sectors – with President Cyril Ramaphosa scheduled to give the keynote address. Watch Below:
