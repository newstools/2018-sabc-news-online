More than 1 000 women from across the continent will converge in Johannesburg, for the launch of African Women in Dialogue. Convened by the former First Lady Zanele Mbeki, South African Women in Dialogue ( SAWID) will host the dialogue which aims to improve the status of women on the continent. The dialogue on Monday will focus on strengthening the African Women’s’ Movement during the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Mbeki says it’s important for women on the continent to work together. Naledi Kekana of the Zanele Mbeki Development Trust says that they experienced challenges in organising the Dialogue. “We struggled to arrange for women in the DRC and Seychelles because of visas.” Anne Githuku of UN women says that they have endorsed the initiative. “With the elections coming in the DRC, women must be at the centre and in Lesotho they must be part of the peace process.” Activist Mojanku Gumbi calls for focus on peace processes on the continent. “When you look in all these peace summits, women are not there but they don’t start wars. They are actually victims of war and conflict.” Nana Ngobese of SAWID says that the meeting will help women work together and assist one another for growth purposes. WATCH BELOW:
