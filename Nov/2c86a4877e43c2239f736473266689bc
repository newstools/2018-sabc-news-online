Zimbabwe’s former President Robert Mugabe is unable to walk because of ill health. That’s according to Zimbabwe president Emmerson Mnangagwa. The 94-year-old has been in Singapore for treatment for an undisclosed illness for the past two months. Mnangagwa says Mugabe will be back in the country in the coming days. The Zimbabwe President told a crowd in Harare that Mugabe is old and unable to walk – and his administration will provide whatever the elder statesman needs. “He is the founding father of the nation of Zimbabwe. He is our founding father of free Zimbabwe. We thank you Chief Gushungo, you are the one who gave us this son of yours. He is the one who led us during the war until we got independent. We are looking after him, he is our elder statesman. Right now for the past two months he has been in Singapore and he will return on the 30th of November.” Exactly a year ago to the day, Mnangagwa took over the reigns of both ZANU PF party and Zimbabwe from longtime leader Mugabe. Their relationship had turned sour as Mnangagwa came under increasing accusations from some party members of wanting to unseat Mugabe leading to the latter firing him from both party and government. This led to the intervention of the military lead by the then commander General Chiwenga and subsequently Mugabe resigned. Now a year on it seems all is forgotten and their relations are on the mend. Turning to the current economic situation, Mnangagwa gave a strong warning to those who are profiteering from the current situation. “The majority of you who are now selling medical provisions asking for U.S dollars, it’s not proper. Because you go and queue at the Reserve Bank asking for foreign currency to import these drugs. There is no reason why you should therefore ask the public to purchase these drugs in foreign currency when you yourselves acquire it from the Reserve Bank. Those of you who do not head this caution, danger is coming, we will withdraw your licences.” WATCH VIDEO BELOW:
