Former Public Enterprises minister Barbara Hogan will continue to testify at the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture in Parktown, Johannesburg on Tuesday morning. Hogan is expected to reveal explosive evidence in her testimony. Hogan will wrap up her testimony in which she is expected to reveal how she refused to succumb to the Guptas’ demand that she  scrap a lucrative flight route between Johannesburg and Mumbai for the benefit of their business and how former President Jacob Zuma subsequently fired her. On Monday, she told the commission how former President Zuma interfered in the appointments of senior positions especially when it came to Transnet’s CEO. Hogan revealed to the commission that the former President only wanted Siyabonga Gama to occupy the post despite pending charges against him. The former minister is expect to conclude her testimony, where she is set to detail how the Gupta brothers approached her asking her to cancel the SAA route from Johannesburg to Mumbai.
