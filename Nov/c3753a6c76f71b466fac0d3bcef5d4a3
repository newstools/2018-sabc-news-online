The bail application of two men arrested in connection with the gruesome murder of a Vlakfontein family near Lenasia, south of Johannesburg has been postponed until Wednesday in the Lenasia Magistrate’s Court. Twenty seven-year-old Ernest Mabaso and 61-year-old Fifita Khupe are facing seven counts of murder. This is after three women and four children were found murdered and buried under a heap of sand at their home in Vlakfontein last month. Mabaso is facing three additional rape charges. “The bail application of Ernest Mabaso and Fifita Khupe has been postponed till tomorrow (Wednesday) by the Lenasia Magistrate’s Court. This is after the building experienced electrical problems due to a faulty cable that was detected by a technician on site and this technician is working together with his team to resolve the problem so that the bail application can be heard tomorrow (Wednesday),” says National Prosecutions Authority (NPA) spokesperson Phindi Mjonondwana.
