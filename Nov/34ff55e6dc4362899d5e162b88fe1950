The case against two men, including a municipal official, accused of the murder of an Internal Auditor from the Nongoma Municipality has been postponed. Phakamile Mthembu and his co-accused have been charged with the murder of Archie Duma. Duma was gunned down outside the Nongoma Municipal offices in 2016. In court, the legal representative for the accused withdrew from the matter. The court then postponed the case until December 12 to give the new legal representative time to familiarise themselves with the matter. A key witness in the case, who was under the policeâ€™s witness protection programme, was killed under mysterious circumstances in Port Elizabeth while in a safe house. Bonginkosi Shoyisa was due to testify when the trial begins. Police remain mum on his murder. WATCH RELATED VIDEO:
