Executive Director at Corruption Watch David Lewis, says the public would be better served if they focussed their attention on the likes of the continued deployments of Bathabile Dlamini and Nomvula Mokonyane rather than focussing on Pravin Gordhan who is against corruption. Lewis was speaking on Morning Live following the protests by members from the Black First Land First Movement and the Economic Freedom Fighters outside the State Capture Commission on Monday calling on Gordhan to resign. Minister Pravin Gordhan appeared before commission on Monday and is continuing with testimony on Tuesday. Lewis says calling for the minister to resign is confusing, because he has shown that he is not a push over. “The public sees him as a key face of public opposition to corruption and a competent person who remains a thorn in the flesh of those who benefitted from State Capture.” In his testimony on Monday, Gordhan spoke about former president Jacob Zuma’s obsession with the nuclear build programme and his interference in the appointment of boards at state owned entities. He also made mention of how he learnt about his axing as Finance Minister through the media. For more on the interview watch below:
