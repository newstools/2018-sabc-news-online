The South African Municipal Workers’ Union (Samwu) in the North West says it is concerned about municipalities that do not honour payments for statutory deductions such as pension and medical aid. The union said more than 8000 of its members have been affected by the none-payment of deductibles. Workers at Tswaing Local Municipality in Delareyville say they have received advices about possible lapse due to non-payment of premiums. Samwu provincial secretary Vincent Diphoko says the organisation has resolved that criminal cases be laid against the municipalities that are defaulting. Diphoko says, “I have been mandated by the provincial office bearers to go and open cases in each municipality that is affected by this statutory deduction so that the employer must take this thing very seriously. After our meeting with these people of Tswaing municipality we will go to the police station to open a criminal case because this thing it is a fraud. You cannot deduct the money from salaries of workers and you do not pay it when it is due.” Tswaing is one of eight municipalities that have been placed under-administration.
