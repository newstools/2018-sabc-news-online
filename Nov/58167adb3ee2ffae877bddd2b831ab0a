Britain’s former foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, has urged his former colleagues to cancel the draft Brexit agreement. This comes as Prime Minister, Theresa May, is meeting her ministers for one-on-one talks to secure their support for the draft deal reached with the European Union last night on the terms of Britain’s exit. The breakthrough came after months of negotiations but fears continue of Britain leaving the bloc next March with no deal at all. Johnson, who quit the cabinet over Brexit in July, says the deal would leave Britain a vassal state. “We are going to stay in the customs union with this deal. We are going to stay effectively in large parts of the single market. That means its vassal state stuff. We are getting to, for the first time in a thousand years, this place and parliament will not have a say over the laws that govern this country. It is a quite incredible state of affairs that is utterly unacceptable to anyone who believes in democracy,” states Johnson.
