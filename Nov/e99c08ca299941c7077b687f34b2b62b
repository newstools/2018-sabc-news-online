The Fetakgomo-Tubatse council sitting at Apel, outside Burgersfort in Limpopo, has collapsed after continuous disruption by Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) councilors. The councilors were disputing the minutes of the previous council sitting. They say the minutes were fabricated. The council sitting was expected to take decisions on the future of the Municipal Manager and Chief Financial Officer who are allegedly involved in taking R230 million to VBS Mutual Bank. Democratic Alliance (DA) councilor Isaac Makgopa confirms that some councilors were unhappy about the minutes. “There was a disruption again today because the fellow councillors wanted secretary of council to declare or approve the documents of those resolution whether he has knowledge of documents whether or not that’s why there was a disruption on that issue. “ Meanwhile, members of the municipal workers union, Samwu, also entered the council chambers holding placards. Samwu wants the Corporate Manager Mafori Phasha removed. Union Chairperson Collen Dlamini says that Phasha was illegally appointed. “His application was done after the directorate for the corporate services was close, he’s also implementing wage curve which doesn’t have collective agreement, which is illegal to us.” The provincial government wants to put the Fetakgomo-Tubatse and Giyani municipalities under administration due to poor financial management.
