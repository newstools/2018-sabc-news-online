Minister of Public Enterprises Pravin Gordhan says there was pressure from the Gupta-owned company Oakbay for the executive to intervene in the issues surrounding the closure of the company’s bank accounts. He is testifying before the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture in Parktown, Johannesburg. Gordhan says an inter-ministerial committee chaired by former Minister of Mineral Resources Mosebenzi Zwane was established and former president Jacob Zuma insisted that he leads the team of ministers. However, Gordhan says he refused to attend any of the meetings arranged to allow government to intervene in the Gupta businesses. This was because the legal advice that Treasury had sought said that his department could not intervene. Watch the full hearing below:
