The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) in the Free State says it will continue with the fight against corruption in the Fezile Dabi District. EFF Provincial Secretary Busankwe Msimanga has encouraged the people of Ward 11, at Parys in Ngwathe Local Municipality to vote for EFF in upcoming by-elections. The elections come as a result of the death of African National Congress (ANC) Councillor in this ward. The elections will take place on Wednesday with special voting taking place on Tuesday. “When you look at the reality of the situation, people’s lives are getting worse on daily basis, so we are calling on them that their only hope is Economic Freedom Fighters – which is going to change their lives for the better. If you can go there and check, they are drinking water that you cannot drink as a human being. Services have collapsed both in Moqhaka and Ngwathe, there is a lot of corruption going on there,” says Msimanga.
