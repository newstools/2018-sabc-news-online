Parliament’s Standing Committee on Public Accounts says it believes the SABC should be creative enough to find ways of avoiding “day zero” when it comes to retrenchments. Day zero was announced by the SABC Board when it appeared before the Communications Committee on Tuesday. They indicated that SABC faces a situation where staff may not receive salaries at some point early next year. Chairperson Themba Godi says the committee hopes that the SABC can save all jobs and find solutions to the retrenchments, so that the anxiety felt by everyone can pass. The committee says it wants to emphasise that the political leadership within the Department of Communications can and should do more to help the SABC avert the crisis it is facing.
