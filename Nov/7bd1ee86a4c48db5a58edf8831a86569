The Democratic Alliance (DA) says if Parliament concludes the expropriation of land without compensation without looking at the written submissions that would render the process useless. It is one of the parties that are threatening to approach the Constitutional Court over procedural issues on the expropriation of land without compensation. They claim that if the committee fails to look at the more than 700000 written submissions on the matter, it will render the process flawed. The Constitutional Review Committee held public hearings in all the provinces as well as Parliament on this matter. It has also received thousands of written submissions, which the opposition claims have been ignored. DA spokesperson on Justice, Glynnis Breytenbach, elaborates says, “There is a constitutional imperative or the committee to engage with all the information to engage with all the players and the committee appears to be determined not to do and as a soon as the committee fails to apply its mind then the matter become reviewable.”
