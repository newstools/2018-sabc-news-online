The Democratic Alliance (DA) has described the cabinet reshuffle by President Cyril Ramaphosa as a big disappointment. This follows Ramaphosa’s cabinet reshuffle which saw the merging of the Communications and Telecommunications and Postal Services Ministries, now headed by Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams. Ministers Bathabile Dlamini and Nomvula Mokonyane remain in the cabinet after calls from critics for them to be axed. DA MP Solly Malatsi says the reshuffle is a typical reinvention of the wheel, with old ministers being kept in the executive despite their failures. “This reshuffle is a major disappointment because really what we are seeing is the recycling of the same old failed ministers from previous departments being moved to other departments. The collapsing and merging of the two departments you referred gets overshadowed by the fact that there are still ministers in President Ramaphosa’s cabinet who have been found to have lied and found on numerous acts to have acted unethical. The fact that they are still in the cabinet even today remains one of the disappointments because he has the opportunity to chuck them out,” says Malatsi. Watch the cabinet reshuffle video below:
