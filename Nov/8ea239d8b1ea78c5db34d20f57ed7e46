The Democratic Alliance(DA)  has welcomed the decision of the North Gauteng High Court that former President Jacob Zuma must pay his  legal costs in the State Capture Review case. Zuma had applied for leave to appeal the personal costs order incurred when he tried to have the report by former Public Prosecutor, Thuli Madonsela set and aside and reviewed. “We believed all along that his objection to the appointment of a commission of inquiry into state capture was baseless and had no merit and we believe that the only reason he engaged in that litigation was to attempt to avoid the appointment of that commission and that this must serve as a salutory lesson to senior governemnt officials and cabinet members that they should carry out their duties and carry out the law rather than engage in frivolous litigation,” says DA’s James Selfe.
