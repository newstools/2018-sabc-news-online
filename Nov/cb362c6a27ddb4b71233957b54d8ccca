Trade union Solidarity says over 20 managers at Eskom could face job losses after Eskom announced that its board had approved Section 189 of the Labour Relations Act to allow the power utility to retrench staff. Eskom wants to reduce its top management as it struggles to bring down costs and says the move is the first step towards the company’s proposed restructuring. Solidarity’s Chief Executive Dirk Hermann said Eskom’s top management is bloated. Hermann says, “Eskom restructuring process starts on top level, that’s where the problem started. Eskom has a big management problem, it was poor and corrupt. The answer is not to cut workers but restore effective management at Eskom.” Click related video below:
