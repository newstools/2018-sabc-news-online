African National Congress (ANC) Treasurer General Paul Mashatile says issues facing Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba will be discussed by the party’s top six officials on Monday next week. In what has been a turbulent week for Gigaba, with Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane has recommended in a report released on Wednesday that President Cyril Ramaphosa should take disciplinary action against him for lying under oath in court. Days earlier, an explicit sex video of Gigaba emerged on social media, which sparked calls for him to resign. Mashatile says the party still needs to study Mkhwebane’s report and speak to Gigaba. “I think it will be unfair for me to judge him before we are able as a leadership to apply our minds on the reports and probably also allow him a chance to talk to us. I think it is a principle of fairness, let’s not conclude today and those reports have not reached us,we will meet on Monday and probably by that time we will have all the reports and we will deal with it.” “It is not in our nature as the ANC to close our eyes when there are burning issues in the country including this one we will deal with it.” Related video click below:
