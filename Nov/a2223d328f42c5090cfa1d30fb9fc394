Former SABC COO Hlaudi Motsoeneng says he respects the Constitutional court ruling and will abide by it. On Monday, the court dismissed his application for leave to appeal the Labour Court’s ruling that he personally pay the legal cost pertaining to the banning of the coverage of service delivery protests in 2016. Eight SABC journalists represented by trade unions Solidarity and Bemawu won the case in the Labour Court. The court ordered that Motsoeneng personally pay the legal costs. He however approached the Labour Appeals Court and the Supreme Court of Appeal which dismissed his application. He then applied to the Constitutional Court which ruled that the application had no prospect of success. Motsoeneng says: “I’m happy that I have been fighting this battle, but at the end of the day, I must also respect the Constitutional Court. I don’t have any issue with their order. I’m happy to abide by the Constitutional Court.” Solidarity’s legal representative Anthon van der Bijl says: “We are overjoyed with the win. It means it’s the end of the long journey. It means Mr Motsoeneng must pay up. We are going to proceed with the warrant of execution against him. We are looking to go after a few of his houses. We are ecstatic about the win.” Related Video:
