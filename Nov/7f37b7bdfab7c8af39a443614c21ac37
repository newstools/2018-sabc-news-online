Governance challenges, financial mismanagement, corruption and regulatory uncertainty are some of the challenges that are painting a negative picture of the continent to investors. President Cyril Ramaphosa told delegates at the Africa Investment Forum that Africa should institute reforms and resolve the problems keeping investors away. President Ramaphosa says the governments should listen to concerns of business and suggested solutions. Ramaphosa says Africa integration is important to growth. He says the new Free Trade Agreement is seen as a historic development that is fundamental to changing the African economies. This will boost better policy harmonisation and expand market access and unleash the potential of the continent through industrialisation. He says African leaders know what needs to be done and they are doing it. Billionaire businessman Aliko Dangote says regulatory clarity is key for further investments on the continent.
