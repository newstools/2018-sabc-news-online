The Communication Workers’ Union in KwaZulu-Natal says the SABC should withdraw its intention to retrench workers or face a total shutdown. The public broadcaster has confirmed that it intends to retrench close to a thousand permanent staff and not renew the contracts of around 1200 freelancers in a bid to cut costs. CWU general-secretary Aubrey Tshabalala has called for the SABC Board to step down for what he calls its failure to save jobs… He adds, “We are not going to rely on the elite that are beefed up in Parliament that have nothing to do with the interest of the workers but their own well being and families. When we are toyi toying its not an aerobics exercise – we are sitting under serious pain as workers are unsure, you understand the pain of the working class because yourself – they sent you here but the main culprits are sitting in Auckland Park. The chairperson of the board is in the forefront of destroying the jobs of South Africans.”
