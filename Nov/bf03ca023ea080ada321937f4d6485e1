The Constitutional Court has reserved judgment in the matter involving Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane and the Reserve Bank. The High Court in Pretoria had earlier ordered that Mkhwebane personally pay 15% of the bank’s legal costs after the bank challenged her findings in the Absa-Bankorp report in February this year. Mkhwebane’s controversial report was set aside along with its remedial action which had ordered the Special Investigating Unit to recover more than R1 billion from Absa for an apartheid-era bailout. Mkhwebane approached the highest court in the land, to seek leave to appeal the judgment which could see her fork out R 900 000 in legal fees.
