The Eastern Cape government and the private sector have joined hands in the fight against rhino poaching. Economic Development and Tourism MEC Oscar Mabuyane says community members and rangers from different game reserves marched to the High Court in Makhanda, where three rhino poaching suspects were appearing. The suspects include two Zimbabwean nationals and a South African. They are facing 55 charges including the main one of theft. “Today (Monday), we have mobilised the civil society for the advocacy against anti-rhino poaching. We have made this clarion call to say ‘let’s all be here today.’ As you can see that South Africans, black and white, have actually responded to that call. They are all here and they have spoken and unequivocally said No not in our province’. And we continue sending that message – it is a narrative we are going to live with to the point that there are no criminal elements in our communities and societies,” says Mabuyane.
