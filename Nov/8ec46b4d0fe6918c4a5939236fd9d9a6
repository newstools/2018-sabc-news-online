Two firefighters who suffered burns in the Bank of Lisbon building fire in Johannesburg, which claimed the lives of three other fire fighters, have been discharged from hospital. The two spent over two months in hospital for severe burns to their hands. Moleko Bereng and Livhuwani Maumela now begin an intensive programme of physiotherapy to regain the use of their hands. Member of Mayoral Committee (MMC) for Public Safety, Michael Sun says the cause of the fire is still under investigation. “The investigation is a complicated one. Because it’s a criminal investigation the SAPS will conduct their investigation. We, in terms of the city of Johannesburg, will conduct our own investigation… but the matter is still opening. We are hoping that within the next few months that the investigation would have concluded then, we will be able to report back and find out what exactly caused the fire and what fuelled the fire to such an extent that this fire burnt for two days,” says Sun.
