Delegates at the National Men’s Parliament in Cape Town have been urged to acknowledge their role as perpetrators of gender violence and commit to change their ways. Speakers have called for a mindset change where society abandons the old gender stereotypes about the roles of men and women. The parliament has brought together delegates from civil society organisations, religious and traditional leaders, gender rights activists as well as government representatives. “We are meeting here not to deepen patriarchy, and not to sit here and hug each other and praise each other and pat each other how good we are… But I think that we will use these platforms as to go to the district to in fact acknowledge our capability that as men it is us who rape, women don’t rape themselves. It is us who violate them,” says Mbuyiselo Botha of the Commission for Gender Equality. Watch related video below:
