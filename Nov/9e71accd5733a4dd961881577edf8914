The Nuclear Energy Corporation of South Africa (NECSA) says the closure of its NTP Radioisotopes subsidiary has had an adverse impact on the medical fraternity. The facility produces nuclear medicine to treat cancer and TB patients. The NTP facility accounts for close to 50%Â  of NECSA total revenue. Energy regulators have shut down the facility twice in the past 12 months over safety concerns. NECSA says there were no safety risks, but a mere discrepancy in the safety paperwork. NECSA CEO, Phumzile Tshelane, says he expects the facility to be reopened in the next few weeks. He addressed the media in Rosebank, north of Johannesburg.
