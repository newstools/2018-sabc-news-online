Police in KwaZulu-Natal are investigating a double murder case after two people were shot dead inside a court room at the Durban Magistrate’s Court on Monday morning. It is believed that a police officer fired shots after his wife had come to court with another man to finalise their divorce case. Tension mounted as court adjourned for a break, and several shots were then fired, leaving the 32-year-old woman and the man lying in a pool of blood inside the court gallery. The suspect then allegedly turned the gun on himself, but survived. He has been admitted to hospital under police guard. Police Spokesperson Thembeka Mbhele says, “At this stage, we cannot talk much about the investigation because it’s still early days of the investigation, and the suspect already tried to commit suicide. He is under police guard – but for now he is charged with double murder.” Court staff including clerks and interpreters had to be escorted out by police. The Department of Justice said security was not breached. This despite the alleged perpetrator not being stationed at the Durban Magistrate’s Court. The Department’s Steve Mahlangu says, “Police officers are allowed to enter any building in the country, as long as they have their identification cards with them, to verify who they are.” The motive for the shooting is unknown at this stage – and police are investigating.
