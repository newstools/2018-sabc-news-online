The Constitutional Court on Monday ruled that it will no longer be necessary to give prior notification to the responsible officer of a municipality for a peaceful protest of more than 15 people. The ruling comes after 10 activists were convicted for protesting over poor sanitation without giving notice at the Cape Town Civic Centre in 2013. The group had chained themselves to the centre’s railing, waiting for the Mayor’s response as they demanded answers over poor sanitation in Khayelitsha. The Western Cape High Court overturned the convictions in January 2018 declaring the relevant legislation unconstitutional because it criminalises peaceful protest. The Social Justice Coalition asked the ConCourt to confirm the High Court’s ruling, while the police minister opposed the application.
