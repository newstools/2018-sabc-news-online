A fire has ripped through the well-known Cubana restaurant and nightclub in the Bloemfontein CBD. Mangaung Metro fire-fighters are now extinguishing the blaze and the area around 1st Avenue has been cordoned off. No one is known to have been injured. It’s suspected that the fire could have been caused by faulty wiring. These people were at Cabana when the fire broke out… “We were on our way in when the armed response arrived and it was so traumatic and terrifying because it sounded like gunshots and the next thing there was fire everywhere. We had to run and move our cars. It was terrible.” “I am very shaken. When we came here, people were running. It sounded like gunshots. We didn’t know what was going on. The fire happened so fast and now it’s all burned to ashes.” Watch related video:
