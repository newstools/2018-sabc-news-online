At least five people have died in a road crash on the N1 at Musina in Limpopo. Traffic authorities say a mini-bus taxi made an unlawful U-turn and collided head-on with a bus. Both vehicles were travelling to Zimbabwe until the taxi suddenly turned. Limpopo Department of Transport spokesperson Matome Moremi Taueatsoala says officials are still processing the scene. “We had an accident involving two cross-border vehicles, a quantum and a bus. They were both travelling from Gauteng to the Beit Bridge. The Toyota Quantum did a u-turn unlawfully facing oncoming traffic and collided head on with the bus. At this point in time the fatality report is inconclusive but we are told that we are likely to get 5 or more fatalities and more injuries,” adds Moremi Taueatsoala.
