Two South Africans and six foreign nationals are expected to appear at the Klerksdorp Magistrate’s Court in the North West, on Tuesday. They are facing charges of illegal possession of game products without a permit and carrying out restricted activities involving threatened or protected species. The suspects were arrested by Klerksdorp Tactical Response Team Police Unit, in conjunction with officials from the Nature Conservation. This is after the team intercepted two vehicles at the intersection of N18 road and Dominionville driving in a convoy headed to an unused farm in Mareetsane. Lion meat and bones, a tiger skin, including knives, and other equipment’s were recovered. The suspects took the team to another farm in Klerksdorp where the lions were allegedly slaughtered. A lion skin was found dumped in the bush and large machines which are believed to have been the instruments for cutting the bones were also found in the garage.
