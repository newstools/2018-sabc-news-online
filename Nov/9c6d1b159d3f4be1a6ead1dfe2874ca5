Political analyst Somadoda Fikeni says former Public Enterprises minister Barbara Hogan should have come forward with the information she has submitted to the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture long before the commission was established. Hogan is expected to tell the commission how former President Jacob Zuma fired her after she resisted the Gupta family’s demand. The Guptas wanted Hogan to scrap a lucrative flight route between Johannesburg and Mumbai for the benefit of their business. Hogan will wrap her testimony when the commission resumes its hearings in Parktown, Johannesburg, on Tuesday. Fikeni says Hogan should now accept that she was part of the leadership that is at the centre of the investigation into state capture. “It took up to the moment when she was fired or removed and increasingly took time for her to come forward with some of this information because it would have been vital that she starts speaking about what was happening inside long before there was even the word state capture.” WATCH BELOW:
