The African National Congress (ANC) in Mpumalanga is investigating clashes that led to the injury of some of its members during a Thuma Mina campaign in the Nkomazi area at the weekend. It’s alleged the Ehlanzeni region Chairperson Ngrayi Ngwenya tried to prevent some ANC members from being part of the campaign. A fight later ensued. Ngwenya is accused by some ANC members in the region of being divisive and involved in the launching of bogus branches in the region. They’ve called on Luthuli House to intervene. While the campaign, led by ANC NEC members in preparation for the 2019 elections, went smoothly in most regions. a fight broke out between ANC members in the Ehlanzeni region. Some were injured, including Thembisile Makamo. “Yes, I was stabbed by Ngrayi Ngwenya, the regional chairperson; we were attacked by the other ANC members led by him,” says Makamo. Makamo wasn’t the only victim.  Vincent Ndlovu was also injured. He’s still receiving treatment at the Shongwe hospital. Attacks against ANC members by some of their own is rife in Nkomazi, and Ehlanzeni Chairperson Ngrayi Ngwenya is placed at the centre of the attacks. “We went there because we were told that some NEC members are coming. They tried to prevent us because they knew we will raise concerns which we even raised before with ANC secretary Ace Magashule. There is a launch of parallel branches here,” says ANC Genge,Wiseman Genge. The provincial ANC is investigating: “We saw on social media that there were ANC members that were injured. We are investigating the matter even that of the involvement of the regional chairperson,” says Mpumalanga ANC spokesperson, Sasekani Manzini. The matter has also been reported to the police.
