Democratic Alliance (DA) leader Mmusi Maimane says the next head of the National Prosecuting Authority should be a person who is above party politics. Maimane says this is one of the reasons DA MP Glynnis Breytenbach, among those shortlisted, decided to withdraw. The DA leader and Breytenbach briefed journalists in Parliament. “If public faith in the NPA is to be rebuilt at all, the President must appoint someone who is seen to be totally above party politics. It is not enough to know that the person will act independently. They must also be seen to be independent – and it is this factor which has led to the decision that Advocate Breytenbach has made this decision. This is an opportunity for the President to demonstrate to the country that the criminal justice system will no longer be abused for political ends, and that every person is equal before the law no matter their position or their power. This is an opportunity to reassert South Africa’s leadership role on the continent where the abuse of legal process to protect the powerful is all too common,” says Maimane. Breytenbach says; “The National Director should be someone who is fearless and independent to prosecute without fear nor prejudice, who will right the wrongs in the NPA and do away with the toxic politicisation that is taking place there. I  have no doubt that I can do that, and that is the reason I accepted the nomination – but having given the matter a lot of thought, I cannot escape the perception that I am a politician, and I will bring that perception to the role if I were to be appointed. I don’t believe that it is in the best interest of the NPA. This is not about individuals but it’s about fixing a vital state institution.”
