A former ZANU PF Youth League leader has implicated one of the commissioners investigating post-election violence in Zimbabwe, in the fateful events on August 01. Jim Kunaka was giving his evidence before the Kgalema Motlanthe led inquiry on Wednesday. The commission is seeking to establish if the army used excessive force during the protests in which six people were killed and 24 wounded. Speaking through a translator the former youth leader accused academic Professor Charity Manyeruke of instigating the violence. “I am actually baffled or surprised to see Charity Manyeruke as one of the commissioners like when I indicated earlier on, that I was a member of the ZANU PF, I would sit down with one of the commissioners, Charity Manyeruke, where we would actually plant to attack MDC members.”
