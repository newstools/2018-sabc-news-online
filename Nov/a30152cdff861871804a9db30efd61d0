The African National Congress (ANC) says it is committed to its plans of reducing the size of cabinet. It was responding to criticism of President Cyril Ramaphosa’s cabinet reshuffle, announced on Thursday, for scrapping only one minister’s portfolio. Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams will head both the Communications and the Telecommunications and Postal Services Ministries. ANC National Spokesperson Pule Mabe says there are also other reductions. “You no longer have the deputy minister in the presidency.  You no longer have deputy minister of public enterprise.  You now have one ministry of communications.  Where progress is being made we must appreciate such.  The fact that you have used this cabinet reshuffle to demonstrate commitment towards the reduction of the size of the cabinet, that should be saying to the people of South Africa that we are committed to the pronouncement that we have made previously,” says Mabe.
