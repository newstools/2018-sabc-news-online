The South African National Defence Force (SANDF) is ready to deal with any possible threats on the country’s borderlines this festive season. SANDF conducted a three day operation that included roadblocks on the roads, day and night patrol on the borders of Mpumalanga and neighbouring countries Mozambique and Swaziland. Brigadier General Mafi Mgobozi says SANDF has already started with operations to safeguard the country’s borders. According to Mgobozi, the operations are aimed at fighting the smuggling vehicles, illegal contraband, poaching, and the crossing of undocumented people. “We are working together with the police on the borderline we look at these areas that we take as hotspot. We focus most of our troops on those areas where most of the people coming from other countries entering South Africa or those stealing vehicles we put more soldiers on those hotspots, so that we can curb crime.” Watch related video:
