Jabulani “HHP” Tsambo’s childhood friend and colleague Mo-Molemi has called on hip-hop and Motswako artists to ensure that HHP’s legacy is sustained, by helping to groom more artists. Molemi spoke at HHP’s funeral which is under way at the Mmabatho Convention Centre in Mahikeng in the North West. Molemi says HHP’s legacy should also be sustained by taking care of the Mmabana Arts and Culture Foundation, which produced him, and many other musicians and television stars from Mahikeng. The building was torched during the protests against former premier  Supra Mahumapelo. Molemo explains, “Jabulani would not want the people who burned Mmabana, our temple of arts. His legacy must not be names on buildings, on street names or statues. The Jabba I know must be the multiplicity. He said to me himself, Moja-man oska wara when I die I will multiply. Jabba ma senganga, you build so many of us,where Jesus walked on water or turn water into wine you created super stars, multi-millionaires.”
