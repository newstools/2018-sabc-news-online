KwaZulu-Natal Legislature Deputy Speaker, Meshack Radebe says those who gave their lives in the battle against apartheid would be disappointed by the current problems facing the ruling AFrican National Congress (ANC). He was addressing scores of people who gathered at the Siyabakhumbula memorial site in uMgababa, south of Durban to commemorate those who died in the struggle for freedom. The wreath laying ceremony was to honour those who lost their lives as a result of apartheid. More than 20 000 people were killed in KwaZulu-Natal during the height of political violence in the 1980s and 90s.  Radebe also appealed to the youth not to squander the hard-fought for freedoms given to them with drugs and alcohol. Meanwhile, Ethekwini Mayor Zandile Gumede says the youth need to be reminded of the sacrifices that were made for them to enjoy the freedoms that they do today. Gumede says people must remember. “We always want to remind, especially our youth, as to where we come from. It is important as the African National Congress to always remind them because the freedom that we have right now – did not come through a plate but our people were killed by the apartheid government and many things happened hence the apartheid regime is not happy right now if us as African people are getting opportunities.”
