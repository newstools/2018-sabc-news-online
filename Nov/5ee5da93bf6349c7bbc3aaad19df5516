Finance Minister Tito Mboweni acknowledged that there were problems with the tone and severity of his tweets. This is according to the South African National Editors Forum (Sanef), which met with Mboweni in Pretoria on Tuesday and raised concerns with Mboweni following the ministers’ tweets which it believes were threatening violence against editors. Sanef’s Moipone Malefane said they wanted to get clarity and the context from Mboweni regarding his social media posts, which have even drawn a comparison with US President Donald Trump’s tweets. Malefane said, “The meeting was very warm and there was no hostility and he told us that he understands where we were coming from and it’s unfortunate that he put out such tweets but will continue to support media freedom.”
