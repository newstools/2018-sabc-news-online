Several unions including the National Union of Mineworkers (Num) are demanding that Independent Power Producers (IPP) should not be incorporated into Eskom‘s power supply programme. Num President Joseph Montisetsi says the IPPs should rather be allowed to compete with the power utility. Montisetsi, led a march to the Union Buildings in Pretoria where they handed a memorandum to a government official. They are demanding that agreements between Eskom and IPPs be cancelled. Montisetsi says the incorporation of Power Purchasing Agreements are a way of privatising Eskom at the cost of thousands of jobs. “We are not here to beg, if they are not going to respond to this memorandum. We want the president. That is why we came to the Union Building, we want the president to take away IPP’s from Eskom. IPP’s must stand alone and leave Eskom alone. Why do you take the private sector to take money from the government and destroy an entity of government and the people are going to suffer. We want them to separate that and we want to engage with the president. If he doesn’t agree to our demand, next year we are going to cause a shutdown of electricity all over the country. “ Click below for related stories:
