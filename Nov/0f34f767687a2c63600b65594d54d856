Three men found guilty of the rape and murder of University of Stellenbosch student Hannah Cornelius have each received two life sentences in the High Court in Cape Town. Cornelius and her university friend Cheslin Marsh were kidnapped and attacked in May last year while sitting near the university. In a hefty sentence Judge Rosheni Allie spared none of the men. Venon Witbooi, Geraldo Parsons and Eben Van Niekerk all received a life sentence for the rape of Hannah Cornelius and another life sentence for her murder. The fourth accused Nashville Julius who was found guilty of kidnapping and armed robbery last week received a 22 year sentence. While passing down sentencing Judge Allie said none of them showed any remorse for their involvement in the crime and that their actions left a scar on the families and the Stellenbosch community.
