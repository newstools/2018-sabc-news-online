The South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) has taken action against the alleged perpetrators of sexual harassment within the organisation. The public broadcaster appointed a commission in June to probe instances of sexual harassment and completed its work in October. The alleged perpetrators have been offered an opportunity to make representations in response to the action initiated against them. “The commission made findings and submitted recommendations which the SABC is implementing. The SABC confirms that an appropriate course of action has been initiated against all the alleged perpetrators in line with applicable company policies and relevant legislation. The alleged perpetrators have been served with requisite notices to afford them an opportunity to make representations in response to the action initiated by the SABC,” says Spokesperson Neo Momodu.
