Former SAA board Chairperson Cheryl Carolus has told the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture that then Public Enterprises Minister Malusi Gigaba lied to Parliament when he claimed in a letter to the Speaker that South African Airways (SAA) was not ready to present its financial statements. She has told the hearing in Johannesburg that Gigaba was a central player in a lot of wrongdoing at the country’s SOEs. Carolus says Gigaba once set up a meeting with SAA board members, which she didn’t attend. She says she was alerted that the President of Jet Airways, who attended the meeting, took control of it and interrogated board members – and that Gigaba did not intervene. At the time of her departure, Carolus said that her relationship with Gigaba had broken down irretrievably. In her testimony Carolus says no concerns (were) raised by Gigaba about the Board’s strategy when he arrived at the state-owned enterprise. Click video below:
