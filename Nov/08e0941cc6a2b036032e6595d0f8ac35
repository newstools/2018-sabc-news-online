The United Democratic Movement (UDM) has welcomed Daniel Matjila‘s resignation as the CEO of the Public Investment Corporation (PIC). The PIC’s Board has accepted his resignation. Last month, President Cyril Ramaphosa published the terms of reference for a judicial commission of inquiry to probe corruption allegations at the PIC.   The PIC manages investments worth R2 trillion on behalf of funds such as the Government Employees Pension Fund (GEPF). UDM leader, Bantu Holomisa, who has long been calling for Matjila to step down says leaders must be transparent. “It would be unfair to South Africans if we cannot say thank you to him for what he has done for the PIC, but on the other hand it is a lesson to him and other people who are trusted that they should do things transparently.” “This money is for the pensioners and civil servants – and when he was asked to be transparent, especially on unlisted transactions, I think he failed the test on that one notwithstanding the serious allegations that were carried out by the media,” explains Holomisa.
