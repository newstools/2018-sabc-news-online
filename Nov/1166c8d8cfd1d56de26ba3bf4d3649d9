Johannesburg Mayor, Herman Mashaba, has apologised for what he calls his ‘insensitive’ social media post – after he tweeted about the arrest of a man pushing a trolley filled with severed cow heads. Mashaba faced a social media backlash after tweeting a picture of the trader wheeling the cow carcasses in the CBD. He says he only meant to warn residents of the possibility of being vulnerable to diseases that could arise from the improper treatment of food. Mashaba has requested that the city’s health inspector work with inner-city traders to help them understand safety standards. His spokesperson, Luyanda Mfeka, says Mashaba acknowledges that the comment was offensive to informal traders who are trying to earn a living. “The mayor has always been someone who is responsive to residents to criticise him as well. And the sentiment that came through from residents was that there is a deep appreciation for what you are trying to do, but the manner in which they comments were said were insensitive and that is why the mayor has apologised.” See related tweets:
