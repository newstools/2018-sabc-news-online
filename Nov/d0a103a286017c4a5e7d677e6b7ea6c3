The toll from the deadliest and most destructive wildfire in Californiaâ€˜s history has risen to 77. The number of people unaccounted for has fallen to 993, down from a peak of more than 1200. More than 10 000 homes have been destroyed in the so-called Camp Fire which has devoured an area roughly the size of Chicago, and essentially wiped the community of Paradise off the map. Thousands fled and many found temporary refuge at churches or in tents.
