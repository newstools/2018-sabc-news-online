The Gauteng Finance Department has increased the province’s budget by R1.9 billion. The bulk of the money will go towards infrastructure development projects. This will include for road maintenance in Emfuleni local municipality on the Vaal, the building of community libraries and to fix water pump-stations on the Vaal River. Allocations have been made to ensure community facilities comply with Occupational Health and Safety regulations in the light of the fatal Johannesburg building fire. More money will go towards paying salaries of teachers and workers resulting from the national wage settlement. Finance MEC Barbara Creecy presented the adjustment budget in the Gauteng Legislature in Johannesburg. “The major areas are over R500 million which has been allocated to increasing infrastructure spend of the province. And R700 million we have allocated to health and education to help them deal with wage settlements that was reached at national level earlier this year.” Click video below:
