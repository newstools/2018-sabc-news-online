Deputy President David Mabuza says his recent visit to Russia for medical attention does not mean he has no confidence in South Africa’s health system. Mabuza was addressing the media during a door-to-door election campaign in Thandukukhanya in Mkhondo, Mpumalanga. The former Mpumalanga Premier continued his call for unity. The African National Congress (ANC) spent the weekend campaigning in different parts of the Mpumalanga province. On Sunday, Mabuza accompanied by party spokesperson, Pule Mabe, and Mpumalanga Premier, Refiloe Mtsweni, conducted a door-to-door campaign in Mkhondo. They called on Mkhondo residents to vote for the ANC in next year’s elections. The residents welcomed Mabuza and engaged him on their challenges. Some have pleaded with him to build them houses, while others complain of spilling sewer in the area. Most believe that his visit will improve their lives. Some promised to vote for the ANC in next year. Reacting to reports that ANC members clashed in Nkomazi on Saturday, Mabuza called on party members to put their differences aside. He also says that President Cyril Ramaphosa is leading the ANC in the right direction. “With a person of President Ramaphosa’s calibre we will overcome, I’m saying the members of the ANC,  I’m saying to the people out there let’s give Ramaphosa a chance, support him, we will make it, this is one point this is one milestone in our journey let’s proceed. This time under the leadership of Ramaphosa and I can see change.” On his recent visit to Russia for medical attention, Mabuza says he noted that many people were interested in his decision to get medical attention abroad. “I paid for myself but I was also guarded, I was received by the Russian government and they have given a hospital and they have my medical, history of my illness, so it was appropriate that I go there.” Mabuza has promised to build 200 houses to needy families in the area.
