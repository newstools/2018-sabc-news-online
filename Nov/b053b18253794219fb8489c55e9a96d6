Three men arrested and charged for the murder of prominent Cape Town lawyer, Pete Mihalik, are expected to make another appearance in the Cape Town Magistrates Court on Thursday. Mihalik was shot and killed last month while dropping off his children to school. He was known to represent clients associated with organised crime. “Sizwe Biyela and Nkosinati Khumalo were arrested soon after Mihalik’s death. Last week, a Khayelitsha taxi boss Vuyile Maliti, handed himself over to the police in Johannesburg and appeared in the Cape Town Magistrates court the following day. All three men have been charged with murder, attempted murder and the illegal possession of an unlicensed firearm and ammunition. The charge of attempted murder is a result of Mihalik’s son being injured during the assassination.  All three accused are being kept in separate prisons for safety reasons.” Watch related video below:
