Political analyst and social activist Nomboniso Gasa says Cheryl Carolus resigned as SAA board chairperson after interesting developments started to unfold at the national airliner. On Thursday,  Carolus told the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture in Parktown, Johannesburg that when Malusi Gigaba was Public Enterprises Minister, he was obsessed with SAA’s Johannesburg-Mumbai route which the Gupta-linked Jet Airways was determined to take over. She also said Gigaba once set up a meeting with SAA board members, which she didn’t attend. Carolus said the president of Jet Airways attended the meeting and interrogated board members but Gigaba did not intervene. Speaking on Morning Live, Gasa says: “We must remember that Carolus resigned together with other members of the board and she said very clearly that their reputations had been negatively affected. So it is important also to try and look back at some of the tensions, conversations and events that were unfolding at the time when these people were in office.” The commission will resume its public hearings on Tuesday next week.
