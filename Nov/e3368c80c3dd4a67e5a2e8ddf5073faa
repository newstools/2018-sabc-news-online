As the 2018 matric examinations officially ends on Wednesday, some matric learners from a Gauteng school will re-write the Geography paper one on Thursday. The principal of Mphontsheng Secondary School in Katlehong east of Johannesburg, who’s also a Geography teacher, allegedly helped matric pupils with answers during the exam. He was immediately removed from invigilating at the school after the matter was reported to quality assurance body Umalusi as well as the Basic Education Department. Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi says the incident concerns less than 50 learners. “We are pleased that we managed to carry the examinations up until the end. We had one incident unfortunately where a principal was alleged to have influenced learners to write answers for them in terms of a Geography paper. Obviously they are inconvenienced, it’s not of their own making but for the sake of the credibility of these examinations and also for the integrity of the examination we are making those arrangements so that learners can rewrite that examination. So besides that incident we are pleased that we had an incident free examination,” explains Lesufi.
