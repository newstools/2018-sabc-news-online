Metrorail’s train service in the Naledi corridor of Soweto has been disrupted due to cable theft, affecting an estimated 60 000 commuters trying to reach Johannesburg. Metrorail says the cable theft happened between Dube and Ikwezi train stations. Metrorail Gauteng spokesperson Lillian Mofokeng says buses will be brought in to ferry the stranded commuters between New Canada and Naledi stations. Mofokeng says cables in both the up line and down line are destroyed, making it impossible to operate train services in that area. She says: “To ensure that we try and minimise frustration to our commuters going to school faced with examinations, we are trying to prioritise them by getting them onto buses.”
