Firefighters are continuing to battle a number of fires on the Garden Route which have been raging for more than a week, with authorities saying the situation will remain serious although the fires have been largely contained. The runaway veld fires have already claimed the lives of eight people and displaced hundreds others near Knysna. Local Government spokesperson James-Brent Styan said, “One of those spots would be in the De Vlugt area that’s to the very northern part of Knysna where we have been deploying resources and one or two other spots where we have been deploying resources today…” “There’s still a lot of smoke in the air especially around George. But we are expecting the wind to change from 2pm this afternoon moving in another direction which should start blowing the smoke that’s still hanging in the air,” added Styan.
