Former Mineral Resources Minister Ngoako Ramathlodi has told the commission of inquiry into state capture that he believes he was removed from his position, as he refused to cooperate with former President Jacob Zuma. Ramathlodi is continuing to give his evidence to the commission underway in Parktown in Johannesburg. He says he was being forced to do wrong things in the department, which resulted in him being reshuffled to another position. Ramathlodi says his moving by Zuma to the Department of Public Service and Administration was punishment rather than a promotion. “I felt we were doing a good job and forced to do wrong things. So the promotion was punishment to send a message and once I left, there’s a Gupta minister coming in. I’m sent to public administration and a man who is known and who confesses to be a Gupta friend replaces you and then all of a sudden Optimum Mine is sold to the Guptas,” says Ramathlodi.
