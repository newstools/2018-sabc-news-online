The alleged middleman in the murder of prominent Cape Town lawyer Pete Mihalik will appear at the Cape Town Magistrate’s court on Thursday. He handed himself over to police on Wednesday. He will appear alongside his two co-accused, Sizwe Biyela and Nkosinathi Kumalo. They were arrested last week, shortly after Mihalik was assassinated outside a private school in Green Point.  The middle man is allegedly a taxi boss from Khayelitsha, who obtained the services of the gunmen. The two alleged assassins are both from KwaZulu-Natal. They are facing charges of murder, attempted murder, illegal possession of a firearm and ammunition. More charges are expected to be added. One of them is out on a bail on another matter. Watch Related video below :
