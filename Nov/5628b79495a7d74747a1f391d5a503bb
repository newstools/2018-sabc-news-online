TB and HIV patients have been defaulting on medication since the closure of the Naledi Hospice in Bloemfontein. The 29-year-old facility closed its doors in August due to financial difficulties. The latest funding only allows for the re-appointment of three community care-givers. In 2010, the hospice had 300 patients and 40 care-givers in the community. The number of care-givers has now been reduced to three with 60 patients. This after a recent donation from the National Lottery. Naledi Hospice Manager Sebolelo Machogo explains, “They default and then there’s re-infections because we actually take care of HIV, Cancer and TB patients. So with TB, it’s a losing battle because when they don’t take medication they can become resistant and have more complications.”
