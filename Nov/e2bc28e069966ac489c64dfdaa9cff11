Three men who were arrested in connection with cannibalism at Estcourt in the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands are expected to appear in the Pietermaritzburg High Court for trial this morning. The suspects were arrested after one of the accused who claimed to be a traditional healer went to the Estcourt police station and admitted to cannibalism. Four suspects Nino Mbatha, Lungisani Magubane, Sithembiso Sithole and Khayelihle Lamula were arrested on charges of murder and conspiracy to commit murder. The court is expected to announce that one of the accused Sithembiso Sithole has died. It is believed that Sithole committed suicide in the cells. These suspects were arrested in August last year after Mbatha went to Estcourt police station with some body parts and admitted to cannibalism. Police investigation led to the arrest of other suspects. Mbatha and Sithole abandoned their bid for bail while Lamula and Magubane were denied bail.
