The African National Congress (ANC) head of presidency Zizi Kodwa says party members who have been implicated in the state capture inquiry were not representing the governing party. Kodwa has dismissed suggestions that the ANC is on trial at the Zondo Commission. But on Thursday, the ANC is expected to respond to allegations levelled against Luthuli House at the state capture inquiry. Witnesses have detailed how senior ANC officials and ministers allegedly tried to interfere in the appointments of the boards at SOEs. Several witnesses, who have testified before the state capture inquiry, have implicated current and former ANC leaders. Kodwa says it was inevitable that the ANC’s name would come up at the Zondo Commission. This week, Public Enterprise Minister Pravin Gordhan told the commission how among other things, he was removed from office while he was the finance minister. Gordhan told the commission that his removal was aimed at halting court processes regarding the closing of Gupta bank accounts. On Wednesday, former National Treasury Director-General Lungisa Fuzile told the commission that he received a message from head of the ANC’s economic transformation subcommittee, Enoch Godongwana, that Treasury would now get a Gupta minister who will arrive with his advisers.  This was after former finance minister Nhlanhla Nene was fired. Former president Jacob Zuma and current ANC chairperson Gwede Mantashe are some of the names that have been mentioned at the commission. Fuzile says the message came on the night that former president Zuma axed Nene as finance minister. The former Treasury Director-General’s testimony is still continuing this afternoon.
