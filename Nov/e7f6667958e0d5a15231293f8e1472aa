The North Gauteng High Court in Pretoria, has given the go ahead for Afriforum to send a sheriff to go and seize assets from the Economic Freedom Fighter’s (EFF) headquarters in Johannesburg. This is in line with the previous court order, allowing Afriforum to confiscate furniture and computers to recover court costs on the matter involving calls for land-grabs by the EFF.  The EFF on Wednesday unsuccessfully approached the court trying to interdict a warrant allowing the seizure of assets. The EFF paid just over R126 000 of the R333 000 which was meant to be paid on Tuesday. “We want to send out a clear message that nobody is above the law – not even if your surname is Malema. Afriforum plays by the legal rules – we have the constitution, we have laws and we should abide by those laws and make sure if they are role players that are polarising our society and breaking the law, we the moderate majority of the country expect people to abide by the law and I think the two judgments with regards to today send a clear message that nobody is above the law,” says Afriforum’s Kallie Kriel.
