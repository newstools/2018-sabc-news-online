Gauteng police management has express its dismayed following the arrest of two of its own members for an alleged truck hijacking incident in Boksburg on Gauteng’s East Rand. A captain and a constable stationed at the Booysens police station in Johannesburg were arrested together with seven other suspects. The two officers were in full police uniform, driving a marked police vehicle when intercepted on the N12, while escorting the hijacked truck to Germiston. Police say the truck which was full of groceries had been hijacked in Potchesfstroom in the North West. All the nine suspects will appear in the Boksburg Magistrate’s Court on Wednesday. Gauteng police spokesperson Mavela Masondo says, “As the police officers, we are the ones who are supposed to arrest the people that are conducting or are involved in criminal activities. So if it’s our members who are involved in criminal activities then it raises an alarm.”
