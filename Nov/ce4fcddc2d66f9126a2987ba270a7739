Another MyCiti public bus has been set alight in Cape Town in the third such incident in recent weeks. The City of Cape Town says the driver had stopped in Koeberg Road near Phoenix in Milnerton Wednesday night. Three armed suspects threw fuel in the vehicle, set it alight and ran away. Authorities say the community and security on the bus identified one of the suspects and he was arrested shortly afterwards. MyCiti bus drivers and ticket sellers have been on a wildcat strike since last month over their salaries and working conditions. Related videos
