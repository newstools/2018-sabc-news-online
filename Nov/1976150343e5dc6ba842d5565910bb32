An Indian toddler who was dropped onto railway tracks moments before a train passed through the station has escaped unscathed. The dramatic incident which was captured on cellphone footage shows a train ‘rolling over’ the infant in Uttar Pradesh state as screaming onlookers stand by hopelessly. The one-year-old reportedly fell into the gap between the carriage and the platform as the girl’s parents were part of a large crowd that was stepping off the train. The train then pulled off narrowly missing the toddler. The relieved father then picks up the crying child who was not injured at all.
