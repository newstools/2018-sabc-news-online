Parents and community members of a high school at Manguzi on the KwaZulu-Natal north coast where a teacher is accused of impregnating five learners say they are concerned about the safety of their children. It is alleged that the teacher also forced one of his victims to undergo an abortion in October. On Wednesday, Member of the Executive Council, MEC Mthandeni Dlungwana expressed shock that the teacher was still at the school after dismissing him in 2017. The teacher was found guilty of having a sexual relationship with another learner back in 2016. The School Governing Body is expected to hold a meeting with parents and concerned members of the community on Thursday. Watch related video below:
