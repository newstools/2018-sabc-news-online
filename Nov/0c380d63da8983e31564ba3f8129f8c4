Former President Kgalema Motlanthe’s Commission of Inquiry into Zimbabwe post-election violence has invited the leadership of the main opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) to its next sitting on November 21. Six people were killed and 24 injured when the army opened fire on opposition protesters. The Commission is expected to establish if the force used was excessive. Its sitting in Harare, has formally written to MDC leaders Nelson Chamisa and Tendai Biti, but Chamisa says he has replied to the Commission outlining conditions he wants met, before he appears “We have said we will only be able to participate to certain things because we have no time for this kind of shenanigans , we know that this is choreography and they’re working from a conclusion.” “The key question is who instructed people to shoot, who deployed the soldiers so those are the key questions. They must arrest whoever was involved in the shooting.” Related video click below:
