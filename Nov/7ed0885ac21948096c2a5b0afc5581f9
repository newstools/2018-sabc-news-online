Audit company KPMG’s board has resolved to appear before the State Capture Commission by early 2019 in an effort to clean its tainted image. The beleaguered audit company also announced Ignatius Sehoole as its new chief executive from the beginning of May next year. KPMG SA’s chairperson Professor Wiseman Nkhuhlu told SABC News that the board will decide on the suitable person to represent the company at the commission. KPMG suffered reputational damage over work it did for VBS Bank, Sars and the Gupta family. Nkhuhlu says the board has worked hard to restore trust, even among colleagues. “Now there is the Zondo Commission, we have taken a decision as the board that we will voluntarily appear before the commission, we will be making a statement to that effect.” “I came in as the non-executive chair with my colleague Ramano. We were worried that we had question marks about the extent to which we could rely on KPMG and its partner,” adds Nkhulu. Related video click below:
