President Cyril Ramaphosa will on Wednesday address the inaugural Africa Investment Forum (AIF) in Sandton, Johannesburg. The forum aims to mobilise trade and investment on the continent. The South African government has thrown its weight behind the Free Trade Agreement and is currently finalising the signing of the agreement. Government’s policies encourage cross-border trade on the continent. President Ramaphosa has also encouraged corporates to do business within Africa. The forum will have a strong focus on African youth. The African Development Bank wants to see the continent create 25 million jobs in the next ten years.
