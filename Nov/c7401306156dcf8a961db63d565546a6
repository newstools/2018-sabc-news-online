Seven people were burnt beyond recognition in a horrific accident on Sunday. Two trucks collided head-on between Mookgophong and Modimolle in Limpopo. A dynamite truck exploded and killed all the seven people inside. Passengers on the other truck only sustained injuries and were rushed to hospital. It is alleged that the driver of one trucks drove into the oncoming traffic. Police suspect that the driver fell asleep behind the steering wheel.
