The Special Investigating Unit (SIU) presented its interim SABC investigations report to Parliament’s Portfolio Committee on Communications on Tuesday. So far, some of the report’s findings confirm three irregular appointments with salary increases and eight contracts that were awarded irregularly. The SIU found no evidence to support allegations of irregularities regarding the appointments of other officials. Court evidence has been gathered with draft charges on 38 matters, including civil litigation, six criminal referrals and 23 disciplinary referrals. Speaking on Morning Live, Head of SIU Advocate Andy Mothibi says so far one person has been charged, but they are hopeful the NPA will soon make a decision to prosecute more people. He says the necessary evidence was gathered and handed over to the NPA. “We hoping that when we appear again to give further feedback, we will be able to to say more people are being prosecuted.” Mothibi goes on to say they are not done with their investigations. He says they will also be looking at issues of procurement and if people are found to have cost the SABC money, they might have to look at civil recovery as an option.
