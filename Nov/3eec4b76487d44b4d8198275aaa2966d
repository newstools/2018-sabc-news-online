The African National Congress (ANC) has defended President Cyril Ramaphosa on his latest response regarding the Bosasa debacle. On Friday, the President released a statement confirming that security company Bosasa CEO Gavin Watson deposited R 500 000 last year into the trust account of President Ramaphosa’s son, Andile. In a letter to National Assembly Speaker Baleka Mbete, Ramaphosa says that the money was a donation to his election campaign for the ANC Presidency, but adds that it was made without his knowledge. DA leader Mmusi Maimane questioned the President on the deposited money in Parliament last week and Ramaphosa said he thought the payment was a fee for the son’s consulting services, but was later contradicted when his son denied receiving the alleged payment. ANC spokesperson, Pule Mabe says Ramaphosa did the honorable thing by disclosing this information. “He is disclosing this thing out of his own volition that as soon as I became aware of this detail let me properly put the context out in the public, something we should be welcoming. We encourage our members to be transparent come out on details that they could be aware of, which is what the President of the ANC is doing, leading by example on this one. So this is an exemplary act.”
