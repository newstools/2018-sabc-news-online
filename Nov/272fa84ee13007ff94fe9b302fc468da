Gauteng Premier David Makhura says the Special Investigative Unit will be swooping into the province. Tabling his political report at the legislature, Makhura says he has covered much ground in the last four and half years. He says projects such as the Township economy revitalisation, setting up the provincial bank and creating jobs and opportunities for young people remain on track. The Premier also says the province is awaiting positive feedback from the president on e-tolls. Makhura says working with the SIU is an indication that his administration will not tolerate corruption. “All old cases and new cases that have arisen are being attended by the SIU, we mean business, the ANC led administration means business.” Related video click below:
