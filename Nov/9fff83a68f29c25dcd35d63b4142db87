Five candidates have been short-listed for the position of National Prosecuting Authority head following three days of tough interviews at the Union Buildings in Pretoria. They are advocates Andrea Johnson, Shamila Batohi, Simphiwe Mlotshwa, Rodney de Kock and Siyabulela Mapoma. The names will be submitted to President Cyril Ramaphosa to appoint the NPA boss. The interviews were held after the Constitutional Court gave Ramaphosa 90 days from August the 13th this year to appoint a new NPA head after the appointment of Shaun Abrahams was declared unconstitutional.
