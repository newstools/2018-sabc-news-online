Democratic Alliance (DA) leader Mmusi Maimane says they want a full investigation into the R500 000 payment from the Bosasa security company to President Cyril Ramphosa’s election campaign for African National Congress (ANC) presidency. This comes after Ramaphosa revealed that the money was paid into a trust account of his son Andile, without his knowledge. Ramaphosa has corrected his response in a letter to National Assembly Speaker Baleka Mbete following his recent reply to Maimane during his oral reply session on November 6th. Maimane wanted to know whether Andile had received the payment from Bosasa’s CEO Gavin Watson. Ramaphosa had indicated that his son’s company was providing consultancy services to Bosasa. DA spokesperson Solly Malatsi says, “The admission by the president that he received R 500 000 to fund his Presidential Campaign calls for an inquiry into the relationship between the Ramaphosa family and Bosasa, so that there can be a full establishment of all the payments and financial benefits that President Ramaphosa and or his family have received from Bosasa.” United Democratic Movement (UDM) leader Bantu Holomisa says President Ramphosa must return to the National Assembly before Parliament addresses how he allegedly benefited from money from Bosasa. Holomisa says Ramaphosa’s return to the House would be in the public interest, “The narrative  he painted in Parliament to the effect that his son did confirm that he was paid this R 500 000 and that if that was not the case, he would even  be prepared to take him to police station. He must come to Parliament, allow us to ask follow up questions when he addresses us. It would be in the interest of the ANC, the country and Parliament to do so before Parliament rises. Otherwise he will be hounded not only by the opposition parties but by his own rivals within his own party.” Watch related videos below:
