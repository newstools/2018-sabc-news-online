The Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) wants National Assembly Speaker, Baleka Mbete, to refer President Cyril Ramaphosa to be investigated by both the Powers and Privileges and the Joint Ethics Committees. The IFP says although Ramaphosa is no longer a Member of Parliament (MP), the donation made into his son’s trust account was done when he was still Deputy President and MP. IFP MP Mkhuleko Hlengwa says his party is concerned about the corrected response made by Ramaphosa when he answered Democratic Alliance (DA) leader, Mmusi Maimane, about his son’s dealing with Bosasa. The President has written to the Speaker, saying it came to his attention that the R500 000 paid into his son’s trust account was made for his campaign as African National Congress (ANC) President but he had no knowledge of it. He made the “error” during his recent oral reply session. “We view this as a breach of trust and one that seeks to undermine the House  and integrity of the question and answer session which is  an important and integral tool of  oversight and accountability. We therefore call on the Speaker of the National Assembly to as a matter of urgency, – refer the matter to the relevant Parliamentary bodies which is the Powers and Privileges and the Ethics Committee to investigate whether the President did in fact declare any of these donations when he was Deputy President, at the time he was a Member of Parliament. It would be dereliction of duty for us to treat this in good faith and on face value, because the ramifications of the President’s actions are far reaching at this point in time,” says Hlengwa.
