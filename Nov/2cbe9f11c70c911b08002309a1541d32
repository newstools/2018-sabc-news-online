Legal expert Advocate Paul Hoffman says former Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba ought to also resign as a member of Parliament. Gigaba said in his letter of resignation that he is stepping aside for the sake of the country and the ANC – while also relieving the President of any undue pressure to fire him. Gigaba is also taking findings that he lied under oath on judicial review. Hoffman says Gigaba is not yet off the hook as he still faces charges of perjury from the Democratic Alliance. “The fact that he has resigned as a Cabinet member; it is certainly a good start. But he has not resigned as a member of Parliament, in spite of the fact that perjury charges have been laid against him by the chief whip of the official opposition. If there is proper accountability in political circles, one ought to resign until the perjury allegations are dealt with. If Gigaba is acquitted in a criminal trial of perjury, then he can return to Parliament with his head held high.” Watch related video:
