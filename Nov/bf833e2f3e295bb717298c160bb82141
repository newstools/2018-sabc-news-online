Former Mayor of Cape Town, Patricia de Lille, has given the assurance that she will co-operate with police after two Democratic Alliance (DA) councillors laid charges against her. Xanthea Limberg and Angus Mackenzie laid charges against De Lille at the Cape Town Police Station on Friday under the Prevention of Organised Crime Act. The charges stem from an SMS that De Lille allegedly sent to Limberg in 2016 to influence the appointment of a city manager. “I will make sure that once again they will not be successful because they can’t leave me alone. I left the DA, why do they fear me like this and so you know what, they must just continue and I will continue to defend myself,” says De Lille.
