As the country battles high unemployment, government has announced that it will no longer be a requisite for job seekers to have work experience when applying for entry level jobs. This is part of the strategy to address high youth unemployment. Government plans to change the public-service regulations to allow for no experience when it comes to recruitment in all entry-level posts in the public service.   In a statement, Department of Public Service and Administration (DPSA) Minister Ayanda Dlodlo said these changes will not do away with the inherent requirements of professional fields such as engineering, science and medicine. “This exercise will be structured in such a way that it does not compromise the professional and technical requirements for various fields, all we want to do is to streamline career paths and align skills which will make the public service fit for purpose.” The amended regulations will take effect on April 1, 2019.
