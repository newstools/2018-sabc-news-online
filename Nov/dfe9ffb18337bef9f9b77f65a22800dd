Lack of coordination and oversight from the side of Eastern Cape Education Department and its implementing agencies, is hindering progress in the school infrastructure rollout. This transpired at a meeting between Equal Education and the provincial education department in Zwelitsha near King William’s Town. The NGO, Equal Education, tabled a damning report before the department which also revealed that there are 471 schools in the province built with illegal material. Co-Head of research at Equal Education, Rone’ MacFarlane says the department needs to increase monitoring. ” There needs to be guidelines on how these implementing agents are appointed. In the absence of those guidelines you might find that implementing agents are appointed to do multiple jobs and don’t have sufficient capacity to do that. We’ve also said that the general public must have information on construction projects. In the end what’s important for equal education is the norms and standards which sets out the minimum standards that every school must adhere to and must be implemented with urgency.”
