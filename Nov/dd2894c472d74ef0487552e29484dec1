Minister of Home Affairs Malusi Gigaba has resigned. In a statement the Presidency says it has accepted Gigaba’s resignation. Gigaba had reportedly met with President Cyril Ramaphosa at the weekend over calls for his resignation. Gigaba has been accused of being a central figure in state capture. Earlier in November Parliament’s Home Affairs committee summoned Gigaba to appear following a Public Protector report that he had lied under oath, as well as the Constitutional Court ruling dismissing the Minister’s leave to appeal the lower courts ruling on the matter. The Public Protector’s finding related to the Fireblade Aviation terminal matter. The Public Protector’s remedial action is that Gigaba should be disciplined by President Cyril Ramaphosa. The embattled Gigaba was also heavily criticised for a sex video which was circulated on social media. Transport Minister Blade Nzimande has been appointed to act as Minister of Home Affairs until a permanent appointment is made. Gigaba says he is under siege from people who want to destroy him politically
