Zimbabwe President Emmerson Mnangwagwa has warned retailers who prefer foreign currencies to the country’s bond notes for payment that they risk losing their trading licenses. He was addressing the Zimbabwe African National Union – Patriotic Front (ZANU PF) supporters in Mashonaland, to thank them for voting the party back into power. Many retailers, including pharmacies, favour the US dollar and the South African Rand as they don’t trust the bond notes’ exchange value. But Mnangwagwa says those who refuse to be paid in the local currency might have their licenses revoked.  Watch related videos:
