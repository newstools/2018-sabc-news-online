The African National Congress Study Group on Communications has expressed concern about the language used in the public domain by the board and senior management of the SABC regarding possible retrenchments. The party says the continued talk of imminent retrenchments leads to much anxiety and anguish to the families of SABC employees. In a statement, Whip of the Study Group, Lerumo Kalako has also called on the board to refrain from interfacing with the media on operational issues, and stop getting involved in public spats with leaders of South African sporting federations. “They don’t have those feelings for the people which they are dealing with because you’re dealing with families who have got huge financial responsibilities. So once you go and issue statements which are not showing you as a leader responsible, at the whole work force there, they get demoralized get worried.” Click video below:
