Women and Men Against Child Abuse says the postponement of the sentencing hearing in the Parktown Boys sexual and assault case amounts to tertiary abuse by the State. The case was postponed in the high court sitting in the Palm Ridge Magistrate’s court on Gauteng’s East Rand on Wednesday. It will resume on the 27th of this month. This is because the Social Development Department’s probation officers were not ready to present the court with their reports. Former Parktown Boys High school water polo coach – Collan Rex – was found guilty last month on 144 counts of sexual assault and 12 of assault. Rees Mann from South African Male Survivors of Sexual Abuse says the postponement is a tragedy: “…these young boys who’s been very courageous in coming forward have had an opportunity to start their healing process.  But what has happened is the State has led them down. And the reports that were supposed to be submitted in court were not forthcoming. So these boys have prepared themselves mentally to be able to move forward, and again they’ve been let down.” Watch related videos:
