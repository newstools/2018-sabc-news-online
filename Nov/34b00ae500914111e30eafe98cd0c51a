The Africa Investment Forum has been hailed a great success that has surpassed expectations. Delegates have raved about the quality of dialogues and interventions expected to increase investments that will help industrialise the continent and create jobs. The conference brought together heads of governments, business people, fund managers and development finance institutions under one roof to fast track deals that will accelerate closing the infrastructure gap that has constrained production and trade. Forty-five deals worth 32 billion dollars were discussed, negotiated and closed at this conference. Sectors that attracted the most investments are infrastructure, energy, agriculture, water, sanitation, housing, and financial services. Speakers say the conference shows the collective ability to work together, as well as government’s willingness to listen to advice. They say the success of this conference shows resounding confidence in Africa.  They say this goes a long way in changing the narrative about Africa which is critical to reduce the perceived risk keeping investors away. South Africa’s Finance Minister Tito Mboweni says while it may be uncomfortable for emerging markets to see outflows of capital as interest rates rise in the United States, Africa should be encouraged by the big investments that are here which will help attract more small and medium enterprises. Organisers say the success of this conference has raised hope that Africa is not going to be left behind in terms of meeting its development goals. It is also a great step towards boosting intra-Africa investments and trade.
