A cruise boat which sank in Lake Victoria was overloaded, carrying about 120 people instead of its capacity of just 50, Ugandaâ€˜s president said on Sunday.  At least 29 people were confirmed dead after the accident, while 26 others had been rescued, President Yoweri Museveni said on his Twitter feed, adding that the operators of the boat would be charged with criminal negligence and manslaughter. Nearby residents said the vessel was hired out for parties every weekend and often overloaded with revellers. The Mutima Country Haven resort had been converted to a triage centre and morgue on Sunday morning where police were collecting the swollen bodies of victims. Police spokesperson Emilian Kayima said rescue efforts were continuing. Lake Victoria is the site of many boat disasters. In September, hundreds died when the MV Nyerere passenger ferry sank on the Tanzanian side of Lake Victoria. With a surface area of 70 000 square kilometres, oval-shaped Lake Victoria is roughly the size of Ireland and is shared by Tanzania, Uganda and Kenya.
