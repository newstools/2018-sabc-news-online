Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba has dismissed allegations made by the Oppenheimer family that he approved the construction of the Oppenheimer family-operated Fireblade Aviation terminal at OR Tambo International Airport. The Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane found that Gigaba violated the executive Ethics Code and the Constitution by lying under oath in court in the Fireblade Aviation case. Speaking to SABC News, Gigaba says the documents that the family used as a permit to proceed with the project are fraudulent and those who were involved in the process should be held to account. Gigaba says he is under siege from people who want to destroy him politically.  He has defended his recording of a sexually explicit video, saying such is common practice between intimate partners. He has reiterated that the video was meant for his wife Norma and not for the public.  Gigaba’s handling of his personal life and professionalism has come under public scrutiny since the video made its way onto social media. The Minister says he had genuine intentions when he made the recording but his phone was hacked. “There is nothing wrong that I did.  I have every right to be as romantic as I want with my wife.  Everybody who doesn’t have a romantic sexual engagement with their partners are the ones who need to be scrutinised.  I did not make my sex life public.  Someone hacked my phone and tried to extort money from me and upon failing, they released the video to opposition politicians who then made it public.” He says he has approached relevant authorities about the video. “It was intended to embarrass me, to decapitate me politically, to humiliate me and my family publicly and to embarrass the ANC.  There seems to be an avalanche of attack on me with great haste to eradicate me from the public sphere.  I need to fight on and ensure that I defend the right of the ANC not to be blackmailed by people by trying to humiliate its leaders in public.” Click below for more on the story:
