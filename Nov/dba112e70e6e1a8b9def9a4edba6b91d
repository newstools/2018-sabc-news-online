Police Minister, Bheki Cele, has launched the National Safer Festive Season crime-fighting campaign in Motherwell, Port Elizabeth (PE). The campaign, themed Quiet Storm, is aimed at making South Africa safer during the festive season. Cele has urged people to exercise caution when travelling. “We are here to say to the people of PE, have a safe season… and also the whole SA. We opted to come here so that the people can be safe. We started at 05:30, we had a good train ride that was safe. So the trains are safe, and now we are here to see how people live in the taxi rank. We will be in Motherwell the whole day today, and display our strength as SAPS and increase our relationship with the community.” Watch for more:
