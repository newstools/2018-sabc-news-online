Henri van Breda will remain behind bars after the Supreme Court of Appeal in Bloemfontein dismissed his application for leave to appeal his conviction and sentence. His lawyer, Lorinda van Niekerk has confirmed that the application was dismissed. In June, Van Breda was sentenced to three life terms for the murders of his parents and brother, and 15 years for the attempted murder of his sister. He received a further 12 month sentence for obstructing the course of justice. Van Breda had pleaded not guilty, blaming the crimes on an intruder at their home in the De Zalze estate in Stellenbosch. His first bid to obtain leave to appeal was dismissed in the Western Cape High Court in August. It is not clear whether van Breda will approach the Constitutional Court. Watch related video below:
