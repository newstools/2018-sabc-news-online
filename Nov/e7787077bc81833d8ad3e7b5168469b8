KwaZulu Natal police are searching for two suspects allegedly involved in the illegal sale of land at Inanda, north of Durban, following the arrest of an 85 year old traditional leader. Police spokesperson Jay Naicker says the traditional leader and the two suspects tried to sell land to undercover police officers for R20 000. Naicker says the investigations stem from cases registered by farm owners in the area in 2017 and 2018. He says the cases were handed over to the provincial task team after it was brought to the attention of the acting provincial commissioner that there was no progress with regards to the investigation of these cases. Following a pro-active investigation including the involvement of the deputy director of public prosecution in KZN, a controlled operation was conducted and the suspects sold private land to police agents for R20 000. “The 85 year suspects associates fled when they received news of his arrest at the Mzinyathi area in Inanda,” says Naicker. Police are currently looking for two more suspects.
