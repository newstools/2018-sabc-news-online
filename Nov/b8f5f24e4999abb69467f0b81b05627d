The Executive Directors at African Global Operations, previously trading as Bosasa, have dismissed the Democratic Alliance (DA) march to their offices today as “cheap political grandstanding.” DA Leader Mmusi Maimane, his party’s spokesperson on Corruption Phumzile Van Damme, and their spokesperson on State Capture Natasha Mazzone led a march to the company’s headquaters in Krugersdorp west of Johannesburg earlier on Friday. They accused African Global Operations of corruption for donating R500 000 to help President Cyril Ramaphosa during his campaign for the ANC presidency. African Global’s Executive Director Papa Leshabane says his company did not give any money to Ramaphosa. Maimane says if indeed President Cyril Ramaphosa is serious about investigating corruption he must start by investigating himself. Maimane was leading a march to the headquarters of the facilities management company Bosasa now trading under African Global in Krugersdorp west of Johannesburg earlier on Friday. President Ramaphosa recently admitted that the company donated R500 000 to his ANC presidency campaign in 2017. Maimane says the president must investigate all and not only his enemies.
