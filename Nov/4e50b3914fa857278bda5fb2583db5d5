The Protea Magistrate’s Court in Soweto has heard that there is no direct evidence linking one of the Vlakfontein murder accused to the alleged murder weapon. This emerged during the bail application of Vusi Mabaso and Fita Khupe, who are accused of the brutal murder of seven members of the same family, including four children. Their remains were found buried under heaps of sand inside their Vlakfontein home, south of Johannesburg. Mabaso says Khupe forced him to commit the murders and the rapes. Three telephone conversations are recorded between the two. Mabaso says that the older man bought him a brand new hammer to carry out the crime but during cross examination, the investigating officer was forced to concede that they had no evidence to corroborate this claim. Banele Ndlovu was at pains to explain that accused one made a mistake in his confession when he said the murders took place on the 28th of October. Khupe’s lawyer, Gerhard Landman, pointed out that the accused did not stand to inherit from the family’s estate. Mabaso said that Khupe wanted the family dead so he could take over the house.
