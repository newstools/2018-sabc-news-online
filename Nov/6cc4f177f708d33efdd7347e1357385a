Suspended head of the North West Health Department, Dr Thabo Lekalakala, is expected to report for work on Monday morning. Lekalakala has successfully won a court order for his re-instatement after being suspended six months ago. He was accused by government of issuing a tender worth R30 million to the Mediosa Ambulance Service, which was linked to the Gupta family. Department spokesperson Tebogo Lekgethwane says, “Dr Lekalakala went to court challenging department’s decision to put him on special leave. He won that in a sense that the court said it is not in line with the law but also it prejudiced to him in terms of his labour rights. The department accepted that. You will remember that this is as a result that a number of protests that happen at the department were the employees demanded that Dr Lekalakala must vacate the office as a result of allegations levelled against him.”
