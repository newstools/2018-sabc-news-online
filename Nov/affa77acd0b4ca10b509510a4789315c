The Department of Basic Education has confirmed that exam rules were contravened during the writing of Geography Paper One at Mpontsheng Secondary School in Katlehong, East of Johannesburg. The Department is investigating allegations that the school principal, who teaches Geography at the school, assisted matriculants with answers during the exam. The principal has since been removed as chief invigilator and district officials are now overseeing exams. Department spokesperson Elijah Mhlanga says the alleged incident involves only one of the two exams centres at the school and that it will be determined during marking if the learners were indeed assisted. “In an incident like this one, we do what we call investigate marking, where a group of markers would sit down,  go through the scripts to see if there are any peculiarities that would indicate that some illegal act have taken place, only then can we conclude that there was undue benefits to the candidate and if they were assisted then we’ll also go for the person who assisted them. But what we know now is that there was some contravention, exams were not run in the way their way they should have been run for that geography one paper.” listen to related audio: <a href="https://iono.fm/e/624588">Content hosted by iono.fm</a>
