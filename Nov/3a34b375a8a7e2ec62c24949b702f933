As the festive season nears, financial experts are urging people to start planning their expenses early. There are concerns that people spend much of the year paying off bad debt after buying on credit during the festive period.

Stats SA’s Deputy Director-General of Economic Statistics, Joe de Beer, says their newest non-financial census of municipalities shows the Eastern Cape tops the list of indigent households.
