The latest data that Statistics South Africa has released shows a slight improvement in manufacturing output on a year-on-year basis. Production increased by 0.1% in September 2018 compared with the same period last year. Contributions to the increase came from food and beverages, metal products and wood production. Factory production was however down by 1% on a month-to-month basis in September compared to the previous month. Analysts say while manufacturing output may be subdued as a result of depressed global economic growth, the marginal improvement will boost the Gross Domestic Product in the third quarter of the year.
