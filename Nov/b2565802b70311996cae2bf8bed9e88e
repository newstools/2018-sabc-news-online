Several families whose houses were demolished by a businessman at Limpopo, Kort Hannie Farm in Modjadjaskloof have asked government to help rebuild their houses. The families have been staying in tents provided by the local municipality since Friday. The demolitions follow a long-standing dispute between the community and the businessman, Michael Toulou who purchased the land in 2007. The granddaughter of the area’s first resident, Matapa Maake says she was worried about her 83 year old grandmother’s whereabouts when the demolition happened. “Growing up, it was just a few houses, so everyone knew everyone so we play together. It was like a family – we sleep without closing the door, nothing will happen to you so it was really great – so now after this, we don’t even feel safe anymore. The first thing that came to my mind was my granny, how is she? Is she okay? Did they break the house while she was inside or was she outside, so that is the first thing that came into my mind,” Matapa Maake said.
