Keeping the taps running is a tall order in some municipalities in the Eastern Cape. Much of the water supply problems are due to ageing infrastructure and a backlog in maintaining and replacing the infrastructure. The wide spread drought, illegal water connections and unpaid municipal accounts also contribute to the water problems in the province. These issues were discussed at Water and Sanitation Summit in East London hosted by SALGA and the Water and Sanitation department. The delegates are looking for solutions. The Amathole district municipality supplies six municipalities with water. The majority of them are struggling with decaying water infrastructure. Strict water restrictions are in place in the affected municipalities. In some areas water tankers provide water to residents. Some areas are relying on water tankers distributed by the municipality to get water. The district municipality says the annual budget of half a billion rand from Water and Sanitation is inadequate. Amathole district municipality Thandekile Mnyimba says: “If you look at Amathole it is situated between the former Transkei and former Ciskei which are rural and the backlog is huge. So the money we receive is less than the needs of our people.” Finding solutions and cohesion between the municipalities, government departments and the bulk water supplier, Amathole Water is now the objective. SALGA Chairperson Mxolisi Koyo says: “We are calling on the national and provincial departments to make sure that the fiscal budget deals with that and they look at catering for both the urban and rural areas.” Expanding and improving water infrastructure and provision in urban areas is also due for discussion. This is to prepare for the increasing urbanisation taking place in the Eastern Cape.
