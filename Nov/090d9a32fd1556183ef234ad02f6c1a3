The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF)  is expected to protest at the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture in Parktown, Johannesburg  on Monday. This comes as Public Enterprises Minister, Pravin Gordhan, is expected to testify at the commission headed by Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo. Gordhan was scheduled to appear before the commission last week, but his testimony was postponed to  give time to answer Public Protector, Busisiwe Mkhwebane’s questions about the alleged irregular granting of an early retirement package to former acting SARS commissioner Ivan Pillay. EFF leader, Julius Malema says they believe Gordhan was an enabler in the state capture project. “One of the questions we’re asking Pravin is how did you become minister of finance. Are you aware of a meeting which took place with President Zuma, where certain people asked President Zuma to make you minister of finance? We detail those questions because the Guptas were able to do what they did because of Zuma assisted by Pravin. He’s an enabler of state capture, he must answer honourably and honestly.”
