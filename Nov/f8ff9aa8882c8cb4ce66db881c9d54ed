Police in North West have issued a stern warning against people distributing messages that there will be violent protests in some parts of Rustenburg from today until the end of December. The social media messages are warning that residents of Mogwase, Ledig and neighbouring areas are to blockade roads and pelt passing vehicles with stones. This, according to the message, is in protest against a local resort. Police say they are aware of the message, and have called on those responsible to desist from such actions as it causes panic and may incite violence. Spokesperson Adele Myburgh says, “The police are just calling upon the members of the community to refrain from further spreading false, baseless and misleading messages. The police will not hesitate to act against any person who circulates messages with the intention to intimidate citizens, or incite them to cause violence. The origin of such messages are subject to investigation.”
