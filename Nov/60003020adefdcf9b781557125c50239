The South African Communist Party (SACP) in North West has lashed out at African National Congress (ANC) members in the province who took the party’s National Executive Council to court over the disbandment of the Supra Mahumapelo led Provincial Executive Committee. SACP Provincial Secretary Madoda Sambatha has been addressing the Communist Party’s Red Friday meeting underway in Klerksdorp, North West where ANC National Chairperson Gwede Mantashe will also speak. The South Gauteng High Court has struck off the roll the application for the PEC to be reinstated, saying the case was not urgent.  Judge Seun Moshidi told the court that the matter should not be allowed space in the court. He ordered the involved parties, which include four ordinary members of the ANC from different branches in the North West, to pay the legal costs. Sambatha says the ANC members must accept that the party does not belong to them, and that leadership will change from time to time. “The ANC is not their personal property. That when they were in court we were here, telling everybody that the ANC is safe and it is not an organisation of individuals. So, if you remove Madoda, the SACP shall still remain.  Madoda is not the SACP, but elected by members of the SACP. When Madoda is detached from leadership, the SACP remains.  That must apply to the African National Congress.” Mahumapelo says they’ll take the matter further to make sure it receives the urgency it deserves. Click below for more on the story:
