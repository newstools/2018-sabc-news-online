The killers of Stellenbosch student, Hannah Cornelius spent their first night of their lengthy sentences behind bars at Pollsmoor prison on Monday. Cornelius and her friend Cheslin Marsh were attacked and kidnapped by four men last year near the university, where Marsh was robbed, beaten and left for dead. Corneluis was later raped and murdered. Judge Rosheni Allie handed down heavy sentences for Vernon Witbooi, Geraldo Parsons and Eben Van Niekerk, sentencing them to life sentences for Cornelius’ rape and further life sentences for her murder. A fourth man Nashville Julies received a 22 year sentence for his involvement in the crimes including robbery and kidnapping. Judge Allie said Witbooi and his accomplices showed no remorse and displayed a callous disregard for the liberty and life for their victims. Speaking on Witbooi, Allie said, “He treated them as mere pawns at his disposal to do with as he pleased in his quest to violently take what didn’t belong to him and to dump Marsh and later the deceased in the boot as though they were not human.” WATCH RELATED VIDEO BELOW:
