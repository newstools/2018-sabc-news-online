The two men arrested in connection with the gruesome murder of a Vlakfontein family near Lenasia, south of Johannesburg are on Tuesday expected to apply for bail at the Lenasia Magistrate’s Court. Ernest Mabaso and Fifita Khupe are facing seven counts of murder after seven family members were found dead at their home in Vlakfontein last month. Mabaso is facing three additional rape charges. Both suspects will be making their third appearance in the dock where they are both expected to be making formal bail applications. During their previous appearance, 61-year old Khupe was due to apply for bail alone after 27-year old Mabaso chose to abandon bail. However, at the last minute Mabaso changed his mind and decided to also apply for bail. The matter was then postponed to allow Mabaso’s attorney to prepare his bail application. Related Video:
