Constitutional law expert, Shadrack Gutto, says former President Jacob Zuma is not likely to have any success if he heads back to court in attempts to save himself from having to pay his personal legal costs. The North Gauteng High Court on Friday dismissed Zuma’s application for leave to appeal a personal costs order in his state capture review case. Zuma will now be personally liable for all legal fees he incurred when challenging the remedial action called for by former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela. Gutto says, “The former president seems to be used to plundering and looting public resources for his own cause. I don’t think that he will have any success even if he appeals this High Court ruling. “He will just increase his chances of having to pay personally for the legal costs. But there has to be reasonable prospects to take it to a high court or Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA), and I don’t think they will have a different conclusion given the facts of the case,” adds Gutto.
