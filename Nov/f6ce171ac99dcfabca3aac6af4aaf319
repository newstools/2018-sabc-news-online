The trial in the assault case of Economic Freedom Fighters’ (EFF) North West deputy chairperson, Bunga Nhlangase, is expected to continue in the Molopo Magistrate’s Court in Mahikeng on Tuesday morning. Nhlangase is charged with the assault of Maggie Klaas, an administrator in the EFF offices at the provincial Legislature. Maggie Klaas who is accusing Nhlangase of assault, is also claiming that the accused had swore at her, something which embarrassed her in front of her colleagues. During the recent cross examination, the defence argued that the reason for Klaas to lay charges against Nhlangase is because she was avoiding to be charged with insubordination. This as Klaas did not want to take instructions from her superior, which is Nhlangase. The defence also said the two statements from the police are not the same as they were written on two different dates.
