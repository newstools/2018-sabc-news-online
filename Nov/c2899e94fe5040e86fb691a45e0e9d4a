The South African National Editors Forum (SANEF) has responded to SABC’s plan of undertaking “drastic measures” to deal with  its dire financial situation. On Tuesday, while appearing before Parliament’s Communications Committee, the SABC confirmed that by February it will not be able to pay full salaries – and that by March its “our day zero if nothing happens”. In a statement issued on Wednesday,  SANEF says that the SABC has a critical public service mandate to fulfill in terms of ensuring access to education, information and entertainment, in all our official languages and across all regions and provinces. “Further, the public service broadcaster has the central information and education role to play in elections. In 2019 South Africans will be going to the polls in one of the most hotly contested and important elections post-apartheid – we can not afford to allow the SABC to fail,” says SANEF. SANEF has called on government to urgently address the immediate cashflow problems at the SABC. Further, SANEF calls on the SABC board to ensure that in its retrenchment plans it ensures that cuts do not impact on the SABC’s ability to fulfill its critical public service mandate.
