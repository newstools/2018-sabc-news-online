Analysts have called on the leaders of the Horn of Africa not to take the Ethiopiaâ€“ Eritrea peace deal for granted. The leaders have been encouraged to use all mechanism to ensure the agreement holds. This comes after Ethiopian President Sahle-Work Zewde told the SABC that her country will work hard to maintain peace in the region. The war between the two countries between 1998 and 2000, left about 80 000 people dead. A border dispute sparked renewed fighting. Since Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed took over in April, the two neighbours have restored diplomatic ties, resumed flights and re-opened borders. Eritrean ambassador to South Africa, Salih Omar Abdu says the peace deal will benefit both countries. WATCH BELOW:
