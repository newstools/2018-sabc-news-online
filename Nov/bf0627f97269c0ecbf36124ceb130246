DA leader Musi Maimane says he will continue to probe the relationship between President Cyril Ramaphosa’s son Andile and African Global – the company formerly known as Bosasa. This is in the wake of Ramaphosa admitting to unknowingly having received R500 000 from African Global CEO Gavin Watkins to fund his campaign to become ANC president. Maimane had previously asked the President in parliament about his son’s connections with African Global, to which Ramaphosa responded that the money had been paid for consulting work Andile had done for the company. The DA leader wants more answers. Maimane has sought to compare the business relationship between former president Jacob Zuma, and his son, Duduzane and the Gupta family with that which he believes may exist between the Ramaphosas and African Global. He now says he will submit an application in terms of the Promotion of Access to Information Act (PAIA) to Andile Ramaphosa to gain access to all agreements and contracts signed between himself and the company. Specifically Maimane says he wants to ascertain which of Andile Ramaphosa’s thirty four companies did work for African Global, how many contracts exist, the nature of the services rendered and how much this came to in total. The application follows the DA’s call for President Ramaphosa to appoint an independent inquiry to fully investigate the African Global which has scored a number of lucrative contracts with a number of government departments and SOEs.
