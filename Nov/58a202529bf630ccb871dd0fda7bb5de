Kenya and Mozambique have agreed to scrap visa requirements for their nationals in a bid to boost trade between the two countries. Presidents Uhuru Kenyatta and Fillipe Nyusi also agreed to draft a double taxation in the coming months. Nyusi who is in Kenya on a state visit will tour Kenya’s Port of Mombasa to understand how the two countries can cooperate and strengthen their trade ties.  Talks between President Nyusi and his host President Uhuru Kenyatta centered on ways of restructuring trade tariffs between Mozambique and Kenya as well as enhancing the free movement of persons across each other’s borders. Kenya will also set up a consulate in Maputo by early next year. “We have agreed and today, signed an appropriate visa waiver framework between our two countries; it will help in enhancing trade between our two countries,” said President Uhuru Kenyatta. Kenya’s total exports to Mozambique increased from $6.6M in 2010 to $12M last year.  Kenyatta told a press conference that Kenya will be keen to tap into Mozambique’s knowledge on extractive resources. “Indeed one of the proposals we are considering is the importation of liquefied gas and coal from Mozambique through a government to government agreement,” says Kenyatta. Mozambique is keen to have agribusiness investors from Kenya explore opportunities in the Southern Africa nation, as well as to receive expertise on the aviation industry from Kenya.
