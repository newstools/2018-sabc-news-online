Murder accused Ernest Mabaso graphically has detailed how he raped and killed members of the Khoza family in Vlakfontein. Mabaso’s version of events was read out to court in an affidavit. He and Fita Khupe are accused of murdering seven people in Vlakfontein. They have applied for bail at the Protea Magistrate’s Court in Soweto. They face charges of murder, rape, theft and robbery. The Mpumalanga-born Mabaso says he committed murder under duress. He explained how he was drugged, abducted and taken to Cape Town. He was then told to take on the alias Sibusiso Khoza, and further instructed to carry out a job in Johannesburg. Mabaso says his abductors then told him to kill the Khoza family. He claims he then fled in the car of the abductors, but was pulled over by police in King Williams Town after the car was reported stolen. He was then incarcerated for three years and released in 2018. He says his abductors again traced him and told him to complete the job. Khupe denies Mabaso’s claims in his affidavit.
