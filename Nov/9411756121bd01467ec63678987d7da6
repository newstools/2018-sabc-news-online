Thabo Lushaba used his last money to travel to the office only to be turned away. Thabo Lushaba an affected person says: “I came from Lekazi, KaNyamazane. I used my R50 to come here to home affairs to apply for an ID but they told me the system is off.” Travellers are also inconvenienced by the reported network failure. “I am very frustrated I lost everything, I lost my wallet, and my ID was in my wallet, even my driver’s licences, so I can’t do anything now,” says one affected person. “They told us that there’s a problem with a network so today as well we came and told us there’s a problem of the network again, that’s our frustration because we drove from Limpopo in fact we are on our way to Maputo,” adds another affected person. Home Affairs acknowledges the problems and says it’s working around the clock to restore the system.
