The Hawks have arrested a 60-year-old woman and her 27-year-old daughter in Somerset West in the Western Cape. They were caught off-loading drugs with a street value of around R8.6 million at a storage facility. Western Cape Hawks spokesperson, Captain Philani Nkwalase, says Tik and mandrax drugs were found inside the suspects’ vehicle and the storage unit, including two elephant tusks and a money counting machine. All the items were seized. Nkwalase says their teams then proceeded to the suspects’ home in Wetton where they confiscated more drugs worth more than R800 000, an undisclosed amount of money and another vehicle.
