Transport Minister Blade Nzimande says there is a process involving all stakeholders to seek a lasting solution to the e-tolls debacle. Thousands of African National Congress (ANC) members in Gauteng marched to the Union Buildings on Friday, calling for the controversial e-tolling system to be scrapped before next year’s general elections. The party says e-tolls are a burden to the people of Gauteng and must be scrapped with immediate effect. The march follows Finance Minister Tito Mboweni’s remarks that motorists should pay for e-tolls. Nzimande says all parties should find common ground. “It’s not good that we are speaking in different tongues on this issue of e-tolls. What I would like to say as the Minister of Transport is that we are working hard at the moment, we are discussing with SANRAL, we are discussing with the president, and we are going to be engaging all other stakeholders to try and find a lasting solution to the issue of e-tolls. There is no need to actually fight, I believe that we can be able to sit down and be able to resolve this matter as soon as possible and lets not lose sight at of what is at the heart of all this.”
