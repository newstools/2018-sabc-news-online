North West Premier Job Mokgoro has pledged to ensure that the provincial government sustains the legacy of Motswako artists who are from Mahikeng. He was delivering the eulogy of artist Jabulani ‘HHP’ Tsambo at the artist’s funeral service, which is under way at the Mmabatho Convention Centre in Mahikeng. HHP’s widow Lerato Sengadi is among family, friends, government representatives and celebrities that are attending the funeral. HHP died at his home in Randpark Ridge in Johannesburg on Wednesday last week at the age of 38. Mokgoro says Jabba did not only help those in the music industry, but cared for the students of his country. Mokgoro adds, “Testimony of his talent and his contribution to the growth of the Motswako music genre is a traction that the Setswana language gained within Hip Hop circles. Jabba made Setswana fashionable. When the majority of youth leaders of South Africa were nowhere to be found during the #fees must fall campaign, Jabba unashamedly took the baton and openly associated himself with the struggle of poor university students.”
