Health authorities are urging people to be more aware of the symptoms, causes and effects of diabetes. This comes as people observe World Diabetes Day. Health MEC in the Western Cape, Nomafrench Mbombo, says health officials are attempting to raise awareness of the impact that diabetes has on families. “It’s more difficult to manage than HIV/Aids which most people are afraid of. With diabetes, there can be amputation even if say you have a small cut on your finger or toes. That’s why we want to encourage families to give support. It changes your whole lifestyle from the food that you eat and the exercise. When you do it as a family, it becomes far better to manage.”  Today is #WorldDiabetesDay and according to the International Diabetes Dederation, by 2035, almost 600 million of us may be living with diabetes. 415 million adults have diabetes. By 2040 this will rise to 642 million. pic.twitter.com/ROOMjHmeL4 — South African Government (@GovernmentZA) November 14, 2018  WATCH RELATED VIDEO BELOW:
