City of Tshwane Mayor, Solly Msimanga, says he won’t engage the Tshwane Municipal Manager, Dr Moeketsi Mosola, publicly on a grievance filed against the Mayor and the Democratic Alliance (DA). Mosola’s grievance is related to the leaking of a preliminary report on the GladAfrica tender which implicates the city in alleged irregularities in a R12 billion tender awarded to the engineering company. Mosola motivated for an investigation into unlawful and illegal conduct by Msimanga and the DA administration in Pretoria. Msimanga says he trusts internal processes to resolve the matter. “I’m not gonna have a public spat with the City Manager. There’s a system in place and also there’s an investigation in place to look into all these allegations and, more than looking into the allegations, to get to the bottom of maladministration or possible corrupt practices,” says Msimanga.
