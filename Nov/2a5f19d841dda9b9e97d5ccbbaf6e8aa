Police in Limpopo are stepping up the fight against crime along the N1 highway. This after several cases of attempted murders and robberies have been reported in the last few weeks. Police say criminals target broken down vehicles, especially trucks. In some cases sharp objects are thrown onto the road to cause accidents. A special task team has been dispatched to the N1 between Mokopane and Modimolle. Provincial police commissioner Jimmy Ledwaba has advised motorists to limit travelling at night. “We have now established a task team in the province to make sure investigations are conducted and all those who are doing it will be arrested and as police we will deploy police everyday moving from Polokwane to NYL plaza down to Mantsole and coming back.” Ledwaba says all hands are on deck ahead of the festive season. “A number of operations will be conducted. Part of the operations will be the immediate investigations of all the crimes and the cases reported will be dealt with by a special task team responsible for urgent investigation for urgent arrests of the suspects.” Transport minister Blade Nzimande is expected to launch the road safety campaign at Modimolle on Sunday.
