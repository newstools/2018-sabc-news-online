The third day of sentencing proceedings against former Parktown Boys’ High School water polo coach, Collen Rex, gets underway this morning at the High Court sitting at Palm Ridge, east of Johannesburg. In September, the 23 year-old was found guilty on 144 charges of sexual offences as well as 12 charges of common assault. Collen Rex is due back in the dock on Thursday morning, for the third time this week. Yesterday, state prosecutor Arveena Persaad read out seven affidavits compiled by the parents of the children. In their statements, some of the parents spoke of how they were forced to remove their children from Parktown Boys’ High after the sexual abuse claims surfaced. The parents say some of the children are now suffering from stress and depression as a result of their ordeal. It’s still unclear at this stage whether Judge Peet Johnson will hand down sentencing today. Watch related video below:
