On Thursday the National Assembly has approved six Budgetary Review and Recommendation Reports (BRRR) of various departments and entities in the police department. The reports that were considered by the House are for Basic Education, Labour, Mineral Resources, the South Africa Police Services (SAPS), Independent Police Investigative Directorate (IPID) and the Civilian Secretariat. The BRRR are reports compiled by portfolios committees every year after re-assessing the annual performance, strategic plans and proposed medium-term expenditure of departments and state-owned entities. After reviewing the annual performance of departments and state owned entities, portfolio committees make their own recommendations, adopt the report at a committee level and subsequently submit the BRR reports to the House for final approval for the allocation of funds to those department and entities. These were the results of the Basic Education BRR report as announced by National Assembly speaker, Baleka Mbete says:“Abstain-0, No- 70, the Yes is 154 and therefore the report has been agreed to”. The Democratic Alliance (DA) and Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) were opposed to almost all the BRR reports.
