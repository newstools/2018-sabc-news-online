The Communications Workers Union (CWU) says the merger of the Communications and Telecommunications and Postal Services Ministries will bring policy certainty to the sector. The union says the division of the two ministries is one of the reasons that caused the delay in the implementation of digital transformation and led to the crisis the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) is finding itself in. “As Communications Workers Union, we welcome the merger of two departments which were divided into two – and that came about with a number of policy contradictions, as well as the stall in the digital transformation of SABC – that led now to the current crisis we are facing. So, we basically welcome the merger in the main. On the question of Stella Ndabeni, she has been in the wings for quite some time… We think that she has the capacity to lead the industry. We wish her well, and we also welcome her appointment as, among others, being young and a woman for that matter. So, we hope that she wouldn’t disappoint us,” says CWU Secretary General Aubrey Tshabalala. Watch video below:
