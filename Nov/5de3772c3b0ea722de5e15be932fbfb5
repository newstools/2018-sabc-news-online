Higher Education Minister Naledi Pandor says proper health care and allocation of National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) funds are some of the challenges she is currently addressing in higher institutions of learning. Pandor was interacting with students at the Vhembe TVET College outside Thohoyandou in Limpopo. The Makwarela campus has 15 000 students and for years, they struggled to access health facilities. The newly opened clinic will help early detection of diseases. The Limpopo Health MEC, Dr Phopi Ramathuba, says that since their partnership with education they are able to reach out to more students and do HIV tests. Ramathuba says that they are able to assist those affected at an early stage. Students nevertheless have other challenges. The delay in allocation of NSFAS remains a worrying factor. Pandor says they have made progress in the allocation of NSFAS to all the deserving students and they are now moving into infrastructure. The roll-out of health facilities in TVET colleges is on-going. Watch related video below
