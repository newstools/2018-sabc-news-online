The mother of a seven-year-old learner at AB Xuma primary school told the high court sitting in Palm Ridge, east of Johannesburg that she only became aware her daughter was sexually abused while watching television news broadcast on the incidents at the school. The mother testified that the child raised the subject during the broadcast. She said she gave her daughter medicine after she complained of pain in her private parts. The girl testified that Johannes Molefe brushed her thighs before touching her. She also told the court that Molefe wiped her tears away and put his hands over her mouth to prevent her from screaming. Molefe is facing three counts of rape and 11 of sexual assault. The incidents are said to have taken place during his 2017 school patrol tenure at AB Xuma primary school in Soweto. The trial will continue on Friday. Related video click below:
