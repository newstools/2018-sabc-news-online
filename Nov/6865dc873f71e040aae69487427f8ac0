Police have appealed to the public to come forward with any information that could lead to the arrest of three suspects linked to an attempted hijacking incident in Northcliff, north of Johannesburg earlier today. The four suspects allegedly fired shots at their intended victim, when shop owners nearby retaliated – killing one of the suspects. “Two shop owners who witnessed the hijacking incident started shooting at the suspects and a shootout ensued between the two shop owners and the suspects. It is then that one suspect was shot and killed and the other three suspects managed to flee from the crime scene,” says Police spokesperson, Mavela Masondo.
