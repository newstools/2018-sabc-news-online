Three men accused of murdering 20-year old Dean Jafta of Eesterust have appeared briefly in the Pretoria Magistrate’s court. Two of the accused are currently in custody pending another murder case, while the third is out on bail. The prosecutor asked for a postponement to afford police time to conduct further investigations. The suspects will appear in court again on the January 24. Jafta’s family and friends in Eersterust launched a massive search after he went missing in May last year. Earlier this month, the police admitted that Jafta’s body had been found in Midrand shortly after he disappeared and was given a pauper’s burial without the police trying to identify the body. Jafta’s body was exhumed last week, and reburied in Eersterust on Saturday.
