One miner has been confirmed dead at Sibanye Stillwater Beatrix Gold mine in Theunissen during clashes between miners. Police Spokesperson Motantsi Makhele says two people have been arrested for public violence in one of the mine shafts. Makhele says they, however, cannot link the death of the 53-year-old with what happened at the mine. Makhele says two people arrested for public violence are expected to appear in the local court soon. “Thus far, we want to appeal to the community or whoever who might have witnessed this incident to report to the police. Regarding information which we are having – and we don’t want to jump into conclusions now – but this could be related to those disruptive actions.”
