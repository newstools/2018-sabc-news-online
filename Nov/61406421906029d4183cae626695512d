The Minister of Public Enterprises, Pravin Gordhan, has been subpoenaed to appear before the Public Protector, Busisiwe Mkhwebane next week. This relates to early retirement package offered to former SARS deputy commissioner Ivan Pillay in 2010. It is reported that the complaint against Gordhan was lodged in November 2016 by Lebogang Hoveka, then a speech writer in former president Jacob Zuma’s office. Spokesperson for the Public Protector Oupa Segalwe explained why it took two years to subpoena Minister Gordhan. “We have investigations that are pending right now that goes back to 2012, it’s part of what we call cases that are older than 2 years backlog. So it’s not a surprise that a matter that was lodged in 2016 is only advancing now,  I just want to assure the public that there are no politics here, the Public Protector is merely doing what she has to do.” Then Minister of Finance Gordhan was accused of the illegal authorisation of Pillay’s retirement package in 2016. Gordhan denied any wrongdoing and the charges were later withdrawn by former NPA National Director Shawn Abrahams after it was revealed that SARS approved the retirement package.
