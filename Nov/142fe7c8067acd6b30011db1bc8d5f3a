Tensions boiled over in the Mexican border city of Tijuana on Sunday. Hundreds of protesters hitting the streets demanding that the massive caravan of migrants from Central America leave their country, some holding signs reading “say no to the invasion” and singing the Mexican national anthem Demonstrators accuse the migrants of causing chaos and breaking the law. A resident said: “Mexico has always been a nation which opens its doors to anyone who needs it but there are ways to enter someone’s home and ask for support and help. Attacking authorities and knocking down barricades is not the right way.” Over the past week nearly 6 000 migrants have poured into Tijuana and another nearby border city. The mayor says he is expecting that number to climb to 10 000. Many in the migrant caravan are from Honduras, fleeing poverty and violence and they have received some help along the way. Over the past week Mexico and the US stepped up security at the border with President Donald Trump deploying 6 000 troops to the area and suspending asylum for migrants who enter the US illegally. Meanwhile in Tijuana authorities have urged the migrants to head to shelters for their own safety.
