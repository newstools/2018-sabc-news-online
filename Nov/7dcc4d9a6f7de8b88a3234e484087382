The Communication Workers Union (CWU) has called for a national shutdown at the SABC on Friday, amid concerns about possible mass retrenchments at the public broadcaster. The Union’s General Secretary, Aubrey Tshabalala was addressing SABC staff in Johannesburg. Tshabalala has accused the SABC Board of not operating in the interest of the workers. The Union says it will fight against the impending staff retrenchments at the SABC until the bitter end. He’s called for workers to unite, saying this will send a strong message the current SABC Executive. The Executive has announced plans to retrench over 900 permanent workers and over 1 000 freelancers as a cost-saving measure. Tshabalala called on the removal of the board to a cheering crowd.
