The Gauteng Community Safety Department says it is prepared to tackle crime including any cases of gender-based violence during the festive season. The department held a three-day programme in partnership with taxi organisation Santaco to discuss ways of curbing sexual offences in the taxi industry. This comes after numerous women came forward with their ordeals on taxi rape last year. Deputy Director for Social Crime Prevention, Nonhlanhla Dlamini, says it is the department’s priority to educate all relevant stakeholders. “While as a department we’ve established a Taxi Task Team to deal with the Quantum serial rapes. It was important that we strengthen our educational aspect where we engage the owners as well as the various associations, the leaders within and ultimately expand it to your queue marshals, your taxi drivers because those are the ones that deal with your commuters on a daily basis.” Watch related video:
