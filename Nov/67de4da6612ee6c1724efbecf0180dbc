Black Friday fever has started to catch many Durbanites as they prepare for the mega shopping phenomenon that has spread from the United States to many countries around the world. According to Black Friday Global Report, an average South African will spend R1600 during the sale, with clothes, electronics and shoes most popular.

People I don’t think they will just go there for the sake of going there they want to get a bargain,” says one of the people who aim to participate in Black Friday.

It is like a trap, people overspend thinking they will spend less but they end up spending.” Click below for more on related news:
