New Minister of Communications Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams says she will urgently work to address the retrenchment challenges facing the SABC, as well as charting a way forward on digital migration. Ndabeni-Abrahams said this after she was handed an expanded portfolio, following President Cyril Ramaphosa’s decision to merge the Communications Department and the Telecommunications and Postal Services Department. Having served as the Deputy Minister of Communications between October 2011 and March 2017,  Ndabeni-Abrahams  said the first thing she needs to do is to chart a way forward to address a number of issues under her portfolio. Ndabeni-Abrahams  said, “There is a crisis in terms of fast tracking and making sure that digital migration is realised so we can release the spectrum that is due. So those are the urgent priorities that we have to look into.”
