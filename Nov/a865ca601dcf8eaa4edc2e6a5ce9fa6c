The African National Congress (ANC) NEC meeting underway in Irene, Pretoria this weekend has resolved that there will no longer be “secret meetings” between the party leaders. ANC Secretary General, Ace Magashule was referring to the meeting he held with former President Jacob Zuma and other leaders in Durban. Magashule says: “We have agreed that moving forward, people must meet and have proper ANC meetings. Provinces must be able to invite each other and conduct proper meetings and not in corners or corridors. I think that’s basically what we have agreed on and the NEC has accepted that this is how we are actually going to work moving forward.” The NEC meeting is yet to discuss the issue of VBS Mutual bank in Limpopo.
