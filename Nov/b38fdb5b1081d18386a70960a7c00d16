Parliament’s Police Portfolio Committee will on Tuesday be updated on a report on the lifestyle audit and vetting of police officials. The committee has asked for the report to root out corruption among SA Police Service (SAPS) members. Police top brass will also update the committee on the anti-gang unit’s interventions. Committee chairperson Francois Beukman, says the committee regards the establishment of the unit as an important step to ensure that there are operational responses to gang related crime in specific police precincts in the country. He says the aim of the briefing is to get an update from the National Commissioner of Police Khehla Sitole and his management team on the establishment of the unit, its operational capabilities, human resources and recent successes. The unit was launched in Cape Town last week to police gang hot-spots in the Western Cape. Meanwhile, South African Policing Union (SAPU) has applied for an urgent interdict at the Labour Court in Johannesburg, to stop the police service from establishing gang units across the country.
