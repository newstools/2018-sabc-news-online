The Ahmed Kathrada Foundation says the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) should focus on the allegations against its members rather than divert attention to what it terms false claims against Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan. On Tuesday EFF leader Julius Malema led a protest outside the venue of the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture in Johannesburg as Gordhan was testifying. He urged his supporters to be prepared for “casualties” in a “war” being fought against Gordhan. The foundation has also criticised the EFF for continuing to portray Gordhan as being complicit in state capture with no evidence to back-up their claims. The Foundation’s Executive Director, Neeshan Balton says Malema’s statements are inflammatory and reckless. “We find the language used to almost dehumanise Gordhan most demeaning and the claims that there will be violence are extremely worrying. I think the more important point is really the deflection of the EFF away from allegations that it has to answer. I think it is incumbent on anybody who has got information which proves that somebody was involved in state capture to go and take that to the commission under oath and make those representations,” says Balton.
