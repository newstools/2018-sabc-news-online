The Commission of Inquiry into State Capture continued on Thursday with Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo hearing applications from a number of individuals who want to testify or cross examine witnesses. Amongst those who applied is Congress of the People (COPE) spokesperson, Dennis Bloem, who laid a charge to police following reports of former African National Congress (ANC) MP Vytjie Mentor being offered a cabinet post by the Gupta family. Former Government Communication and Information System (GCIS) boss Mzwanele Manyi testified on Wednesday and will be questioned by the commission on 23 November. Deputy Chief Justice Zondo ruled that former ANC MP Vytjie Mentor will continue with her testimony on the 30th November. Mentor was scheduled to give her evidence in chief at the commission on Friday. The commissionâ€™s legal team says there are aspects of her testimony which need to be addressed before she re-appears and gives her evidence. There are also three applications to cross-examine Mentor by persons she implicated in her earlier testimony. The commission into state capture will resume on Monday with Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan expected to take a stand. WATCH RELATED VIDEO BELOW:
