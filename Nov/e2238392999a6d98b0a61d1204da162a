The National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) says over 200 000 students have applied for funding for the 2019 academic year. NSFAS says students in need for financial assistance have until the end of the month to apply for funding. NSFAS spokesperson, Kagisho Mamabolo says first-time applicants will receive full funding. “Government commitment is very clear that firstly students must apply and be admitted at university and then once they’re admitted at university then NSFAS will be able to cover them. There is enough money if students can apply on time and they qualify all of them they will be covered. First entering students that are getting to university or college for the first time they get full cost of study covered, meaning we cover almost everything including registration upfront at the beginning of the year.” Students are encouraged to submit applications online or to visit the nearest National Youth Development Agency (NYDA) centres before the closing date for assistance. Students from households of an annual combined income of up to R350 000 are also encouraged to apply. Watch related videos below:
