Alleged transgressions committed by MPs in Parliament will be highlighted on Thursday when the Powers and Privileges Committee meets to decide how to proceed with them. EFF Chief Whip Floyd Shivambu’s case was referred to the committee after he showed the then Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa the middle finger in 2014, but apologised later. DA leader Mmusi Maimane and Deputy Chief Whip Mike Waters were referred after they refused to abide by an instruction from the presiding officer during a house sitting. Former State Security Minister David Mahlobo was referred after he allegedly misled the National Assembly about his relationship with Fees Must Fall Leader Mcebo Dlamini. Committee Chairperson Lemias Mashile says, “One can expect that when we meet then all the members of the committee will be coming up with a proposal and have a consensus of how we are actually moving forward in dealing with this cases. Although in some cases, the relevant members of parliament that were question, some of them have already apologised in one way or the other, which means that there is no need to actually engage investigation and processing. It’s just up to the committee to take decisions. How they actually resolve them and then other cases of course still seeks processes in the form of an inquiry.” Listen to related audio: <a href="https://iono.fm/e/625856">Content hosted by iono.fm</a> Watch related video:
