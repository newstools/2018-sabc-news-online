Opposition parties opposed to expropriation without compensation are threatening to take it for a legal review. The FF Plus, the DA and two other opposition parties say the process of the finalisation was flawed procedurally. The bone of contention is the more than 700 000 written submissions sent to parliament by interested parties. Parliament hired an independent, external service provider to process them, but turned away the service provider’s representatives due to the poor quality of work. Initially, Parliament’s Constitutional Review Committee decided that parliament’s own staff would process the submissions and summarise them for MP’s. According to opposing parties, that did not happen and  now the process could now be decided by the courts. According to the opposing parties, at least 60% of the more than 700 000 written submissions opposed expropriation without compensation. It’s not yet clear whether the Committee will meet its November 15th deadline to submit its recommendations to both houses of parliament. Watch related video below:
