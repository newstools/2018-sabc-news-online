Chief Justice Raymond Zondo has granted businessman and former GCIS boss, Mzwanele Manyi, permission to testify at the State Capture commission on Wednesday afternoon. Manyi had claimed he was being unfairly treated by the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture after he was to appear before the Commission on Wednesday – but was then told to testify on the 23rd of November. A power failure on Tuesday forced the postponement of Manyi’s testimony who is believed to be close to former President Jacob Zuma, and had bought a media enterprise from the Gupta brothers. Manyi was called-in for questioning after he sent Acting GCIS Head Phumla Williams an allegedly threatening SMS while she was presenting her testimony at the Commission. Former Public Enterprises Minister Barbara Hogan concluded her testimony on Wednesday afternoon in Parktown, Johannesburg. Manyi has told Zondo that he is ready to give his version of events.
