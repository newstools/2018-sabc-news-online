Democratic Republic of Congo presidential candidates Felix Tshisekedi and Vital Kamerhe have joined forces to take on the preferred successor of incumbent Joseph Kabila in the December 23 election. Tshisekedi, the president of Congo’s largest opposition party, the Union for Democracy and Social Progress, UDPS, said he would select Kamerhe of the Union for the Congolese Nation as his prime minister if he wins the vote. Two leading opposition parties in the DRC, the Union for Democracy and Social Progress and the Union for the Congolese Nation agreed to front Felix Tshisekedi as their presidential candidate in the December elections, with Vidal Kamerhe as his running mate. The two withdrew from an earlier pact by opposition parties that had backed Parliamentarian Martin Fayulu as the candidate to face the ruling party’s Ramazani Shadary.
