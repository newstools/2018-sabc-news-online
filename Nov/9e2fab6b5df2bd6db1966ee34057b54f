Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan says it’s important for SARS to be properly managed. His statement follows President Cyril Ramaphosa’s dismissal of SARS Commissioner Tom Moyane. The Presidency announced late Thursday that Ramaphosa had accepted the recommendation of the SARS commission of inquiry’s chairperson, retired judge Robert Nugent, to fire Moyane. Moyane was suspended in March over controversies surrounding his governance at the revenue service. Gordhan was speaking on the sidelines of the SA Tomorrow Investment Conference in New York, “It’s good to have some certainty in that area so that the Minister of Finance can appoint a new Commissioner. The Revenue Service is a very vital part of our fiscal and economic set of institutions. If it works well, we have less difficulty, we have more revenue coming in and that makes a huge difference in the way we balance our fiscal accounts.”
