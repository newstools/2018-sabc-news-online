Gauteng police have launched a manhunt for five suspects who shot and killed three people, and wounded four others in the Lombardy informal settlement north-east of Johannesburg on Saturday morning. It is alleged that seven men were sitting in a shack when gunmen burst in and started shooting randomly. Police spokesperson Lungelo Dlamini said, “Police are investigating a case of murder and attempted murder following the incident in which three people were shot and four others wounded. This happened after one of the suspects had an argument with one of the shack’s occupants.” “At this stage, we don’t know where the suspects are, but we are appealing to anyone who’s got the information to come forward,” added Dlamini
