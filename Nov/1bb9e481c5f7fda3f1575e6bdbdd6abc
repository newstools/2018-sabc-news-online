Political analysts are questioning whether former Cape Town mayor, Patricia de Lille’s new party will agree to a coalition in the run up to next year’s general elections. De Lille is expected to announce the name of her new political party soon. She resigned as the city’s executive mayor and from the Democratic Alliance (DA) last month, after an 18-month battle with the party. The African National Congress (ANC) and Economic Freedom Fighter (EFF) have both put out feelers to De Lille, who began her political career with the Pan Africanist Congress of Azania (PAC). She then formed her own party, the Independent Democrats, which joined the DA. Political analyst, Sanusha Naidu says, “I think some felt that she should never have went to a kind of coalition or merger with the DA and others feel that this is the right thing to do and that is the symptom of SA’s political landscape. Parties emerge, they do every well in the beginning, and then they take off. So the question for me is with the launch of the new party, will this become a coalition partner in the Western Cape and outside as well and whether or not the DA can meet minds or not.” Watch related videos below
