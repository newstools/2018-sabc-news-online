DA national spokesperson Solly Malatsi says Patricia de Lille’s plan to start a new party, does not pose any threat to the DA’s support base in the Western Cape and elsewhere in the country. Malatsi says the DA is focused serving the people, “Our focus now is to continue with our mission of building one South Africa for all. Miss De Lille has chosen a path outside the DA. We will continue making sure that our mission to create jobs where we govern, to make sure that we professionalise the South African Police Service, but more importantly to serve the people that voted for us. Our priority are the people of the Western Cape and everywhere else in South Africa where they voted for us and it is to unite South Africans behind that vision of building one South Africa for all.” De Lille announced that she will start a new political party that will contest next year’s general elections. De Lille resigned as mayor and as a member of the DA at the end of last month after an 18-month battle with the DA. She revealed that she would announce the name of her party in two weeks’ time.
