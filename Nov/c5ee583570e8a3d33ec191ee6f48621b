Limpopo Premier Stanley Mathabatha has expressed concern over alleged criminal activities taking place on the N1 resulting in fatal crashes between Mokopane and Kranskop toll plaza. More than 40 people have died on that stretch of road since last month due to horrific car crashes. The latest incident took place on Saturday when six people lost their lives after four vehicles collided. The driver of the truck was trying to escape from an attempted armed robbery by two armed men when he collided with three cars. Police have established a special task team to look at the alleged criminal activities taking place in the area. Last week there has been information circulating on social media about a group of criminals who throw some items on the road to force vehicles to stop in order to rob them. During the process some vehicles collide leaving people dead. Premier Mathabatha has urged motorists to be vigilant and report any unusual activities to the police along the road. Government plans to hold a National Prayer Day on Sunday at Mookgophong praying for a safe festive season and a stop on road carnage.
