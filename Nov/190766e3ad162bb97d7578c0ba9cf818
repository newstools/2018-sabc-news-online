Sentencing proceedings in the case of former Parktown boys’ high school water polo coach Collen Rex are to continue Wednesday morning at the High Court sitting at Palm Ridge, east of Johannebsurg. In September, 23 year-old Collen Rex was found guilty on 144 charges of sexual offences as well as 12 charges of common assault. On Tuesday, several witnesses took the stand on behalf of both the state and the defence. Social worker Xoliswa Budaza, who compiled the pre-sentencing report, recommended that Rex face jail time due to the serious nature of the charges he’s been convicted of. However, the report did not spell out how many years Rex should spend behind bars. State Prosecutor Arveena Persaad also read out affidavits from the victims in which they detailed how they are bullied and tormented by fellow learners at their schools. Several learners also changed school to escape the torment and indicated in their affidavits that they also thought about leaving school and committing suicide as a result of the abuse.
