Convicted racist Vicki Momberg is expected to appeal against her sentence. The matter is expected to be heard at the Randburg Magistrate’s Court on Monday. In February 2016, Momberg was seen on a video shouting racial slurs at police officers while they were assisting her after she was involved in a smash-and-grab incident. She called them, the k-word. The 48 year-old Momberg was found guilty of four counts of crimen injuria in November last year. She was sentenced to three years in prison with one year suspended in March this year. She was however, denied leave to appeal previously. In July this year, Momberg was granted leave to appeal in the High Court. The matter was postponed to Monday when she’s expected back in court.
