Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan says he is confident that the current leadership of South African Airways has a viable plan to turnaround the airline. Gordhan says at the moment the airline is in a tight spot adding that it will be difficult to attract equity partners to invest in it. He told Parliament’s Public Enterprises Committee that in order for the turnaround strategy to succeed; all stakeholders will have to make sacrifices. “ Everybody will have to make sacrifices in order for the airline to be able to get its cost base right and the fly better if you like but on a different and more competitive basis that it currently is so that maybe in 2 years’ time 3 years’ time everybody would benefit out of that equation. Meaning you still have your job, you’ll be earning an income,  airline will be flying more extensively and different options and opportunities will be exercised as well.”
