Hip-hop artist Jabulani Tsambo, who is affectionately known as ‘HHP’, will be laid to rest Saturday morning at the heroes’ acre section of the Mmabatho cemetery in Mahikeng in the North West. His body arrived in Mahikeng Friday evening, after the High Court in Johannesburg dismissed his wife Lerato Sengadi’s application to interdict the funeral. The court however confirmed that Sengadi was the artist’s customary wife after HHP’s family disputed her marital status. Vuyisile Ngesi is the spokesperson of the North West premier, “The remains of the late Jabba will be open to view from 05:30 to about 06:30. From here at home, we will proceed to the Mmabatho Convention Centre, where the funeral service will commence. We hope and believe that by 12 o’clock we should be done. Then we’ll proceed to the Mmabatho cemetery, where in his honour, he will be laid to rest in the section of the cemetery known as the heros’ acre.”
