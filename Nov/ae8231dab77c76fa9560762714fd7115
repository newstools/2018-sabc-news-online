About 150 members of the Diepwalle community in Knysna in the Western Cape are being evacuated to the Hornlee Community Hall, as a precautionary measure due to a fire in the area. About  100 residents of Jonkersberg between George and Great Brak River, who were evacuated on Saturday, are expected to return home on Sunday. The Garden Route District Municipality’s JOC says the Jonkersberg fire is now being driven to the Outeniqua wildfire, with one house in danger in the area. They say the fire caused the power line to Oudtshoorn to trip, with assessments currently being done by Eskom. One hundred-and-72 Working on Fire fire fighters are still on the ground battling various blazes in the region. The N2 road linking the Western and Eastern Cape is closed at Tsitsikama due to the resumption of wild fires in the area. The closure of the road is a safety measure as visibility is constrained due to the smoke. Eight people have been killed in the fires in the Garden Route which started two weeks ago. The thick smoke is affecting traffic.  Eastern Cape Traffic spokesperson, Charles Bramwell, says vehicles are being diverted to the R62. “We have decided to close the N2 Trafolia Bridge, we are diverting traffic towards R62, going through Kareedouw- Joubertina and Misgund. We are also in contact with Sanral in the Western Cape to close the toll gate on the Western Cape side. For now the whole N2 between Tsitsikama and the toll gates has been closed and the alternative route is through the Langkloof area,” says Bramwell. Click link for more
