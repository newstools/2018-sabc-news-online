The South African National Editors’ Forum (Sanef) says it is deeply disturbed by Finance Minister Tito Mboweni‘s social media post. Sanef believes Mboweni is threatening editors. It says Mboweni must engage with media houses if he feels aggrieved by what they’ve written about him or approach regulatory bodies like the Press Council or the BCCSA. Many people might not know this, I am a product of the warrior commanders of the mighty Zulu Army from the northern part of KZN, eNgwavuma , we fear nothing! We die only with spears on our chests NOT our backs. Mayihlome! We face the fire NOT run away from it. — Tito Mboweni (@tito_mboweni) November 8, 2018  Sanef’s Mary Papayya says, “I’m sure you’ve seen the tweet: it says war starts in different ways. It goes on to say the SA Editors must be edited. If needs be we will be forced into the fight it says comma war.  The problem with that is that any statement that threatens editors with war is unacceptable. It is very dangerous. It sends out a very negative message particularly when it comes from leadership.” Wars start in different ways. Spears and shields, gun powder, bullets, and now through media: printed and electronic ( e.g trade wars by a super power President ), and then Social media!! Well, the SA Editors must be Editors!! If needs be, we will be forced into the fight, WAR! — Tito Mboweni (@tito_mboweni) November 8, 2018
