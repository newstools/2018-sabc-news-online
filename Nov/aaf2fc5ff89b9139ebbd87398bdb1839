The former guard accused of raping and sexually assaulting learners at the A.B. Xuma Primary School in Soweto will be back in the High Court sitting at the Palm Ridge Magistrate’s Court, East of Johannesburg Wednesday morning. Johannes Molefe appeared in court on Monday but the case was postponed to Wednesday due to lack of a courtroom. He faces two counts of rape and eleven of sexual assault. Initially over 80 learners came forward accusing him of sexually assaulting them.  But the NPA says only thirteen charges have been proffered against him, after no prima facie evidence could be found on some of the cases reported to the police. Spokesperson for the children’s parents Phindile Senye says, “There should be justice. Justice should be served for all the parents, the learners that were affected and the community at large.  As members of the community, we are expecting a conviction but we are mindful that the court must prove beyond reasonable doubt as to whether there was any crime committed.” Watch related video:
