Organisers of the ‘Hands Off Zuma’ campaign believe the former president will not get a fair trial. A group of Jacob Zuma supporters, including some church leaders, ANC supporters and BLF members, gathered outside the High Court in Pietermaritzburg where they held a night vigil. The former president, alongside his co-accused French arms company Thales, will be back in court Friday after they filed an application for permanent stay of prosecution. In court papers, Zuma says he has faced public and media prosecution which he claims is engineered by the National Prosecuting Authority. MKMVA NEC member Carl Niehaus and ANC deputy regional co-ordinator for the Moses Mabhida region in KwaZulu-Natal midlands Mzi Zuma, had this to say about the charges against the former president. Niehaus said, “There is clear indication of political meddling right from the beginning; we must not forget what happened with Bulelani Ngcuka. So I hope that it will be possible for the judge to have a permanent stay of prosecution.” Mzi Zuma added, “Because of the length of time it has taken to deal with this matter we are of the view that justice cannot be done here. Justice delayed is justice denied. He is not going to get a fair trial after this long period of time.”
