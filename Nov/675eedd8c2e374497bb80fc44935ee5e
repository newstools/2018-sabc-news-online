Six years after the Marikana tragedy and despite the successful conclusion of a commission of inquiry, the victims say they are still waiting for answers. Thirty four people, most of whom worked for Lonmin Platinum Mine, were killed after police opened fire on striking workers on August 16, 2012. Families lost their sole breadwinner, fathers, brothers, husbands and sons. In the aftermath, the mine employed many of the widows as cleaners. The widows gathered at Sci-Bono Centre in Newtown Johannesburg, to share their pain. Associated Mineworkers and Construction Union (AMCU) president Joseph Mathunjwa says, “The untold story of Marikana massacre – who gave orders to kill the workers to this day, no one knows because the commission was headed by the state. The state was implicated, so little will ever be found out of it hence we call it the commission of omission.” Click below for related Marikana videos:
