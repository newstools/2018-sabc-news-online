Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs Zweli Mkhize says drastic measures need to be taken to curb disasters.  Speaking  during a function to mark the International Day for Disaster Risk Reduction in Upington, Northern Cape on Friday, Mkhize expressed that investment on infrastructure is needed to increase the level of preparedness to prevent disasters. “Government had to be proactive and had to go out and invest in building flood diversion walls and it is something that is assisting the local community and farmers. The cost is high, but the damage could have been worse. So these are the things we need to look at. Now we also talk to our municipalities to make sure that they inspect all the buildings and fit within the normal standards so that there are no problems with electricity that can precipitate a fire.” The day was celebrated under the theme ‘Investing in Disaster Risk Reduction for Resilience’. Mkhize also visited a 323 kilometre flood wall that was constructed at a cost of R900 million to mitigate the effects of floods on agriculture along the Orange River.
