Former Government Communication and Information System  (GCIS) Chief Executive Officer  Mzwanele Manyi has claimed at the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture, that upon arriving at GCIS he found what he claims was, a “mini VBS” taking place. Manyi has detailed what he claims were irregular contracts to service providers totalling millions of rand. Manyi has been giving testimony at the Commission in Parktown, Johannesburg. He was subpoenaed by the Commission after he was implicated in Acting GCIS Head Phumla Williams’ evidence. In August, Williams told the Commission she had received an SMS from Manyi who she believed was trying to influence her testimony. Williams had testified about changes she said Manyi had made to the tender process at GCIS. Manyi has been a vocal supporter of former President Jacob Zuma, and also purchased a media company previously owned by the Guptas. Manyi said he was only trying to set the record straight in his SMS regarding the Gupta linked TNA breakfasts, which he says occurred after his tenure. Judge Raymond Zondo had said in August that he wanted clarity on the matter of alleged interference by Manyi. He has singled out Williams saying she signed off on contracts when she did not have the authority to do so. Author-Mbali Thethani
