All Gauteng public schools must now re-submit their policies to the provincial Department of Education within 90 days. MEC Panyaza Lesufi on Thursday announced the publishing of a government gazette on feeder zones for Gauteng schools. In May 2016, the Constitutional Court directed the MEC to determine feeder zones for all public ordinary schools before the 20th of this month. The Federation of Governing Bodies of South African Schools – FEDSAS- had taken the department to court to defend its admissions policy. The Department argued that certain schools were excluding learners on the basis of language and race. MEC Lesufi explains what this means: “All the schools must now submit their policies that must come into effect in 2020. So in 2020, we’re going to have new democratic, non-racial, non-sexist school policies.”
