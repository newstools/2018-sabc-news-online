The Democratic Alliance (DA) says Gauteng Premier David Makhura must ensure that all the claims in the Life Esidimeni matter are settled before the end of his term of office in May next year. The party’s Jack Bloom says the R118 million set aside for the relatives of those who suffered in the Life Esidimeni tragedy, as announced by Gauteng Finance MEC Barbara Creecy in the Adjustment Budget, is not enough. Bloom says with the new 200 claims received, the payouts will cost approximately R236 million. “The Gauteng provincial government has only set aside R118 million in the Adjustment Budget. So I’m very worried, where are they going to find the money to make these payouts, they’re morally obliged to make these payouts. And they shouldn’t delay making it. So where is the money going to come from because they’ve only put aside only R118 million, whereas the 200 claimants are going to have to be paid out more than R200 million,” says Bloom.
