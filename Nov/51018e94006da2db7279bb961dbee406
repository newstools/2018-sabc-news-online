KwaZulu-Natal Health MEC Sibongiseni Dhlomo has warned social media users that what they post online can negatively affect their careers. This follows the suspension of a finance intern at Prince Mshiyeni hospital in the south of Durban. The student sparked a social media outrage after expressing his desire to rape his 10 -year-old neighbour. The intern later claimed it was a joke, but Dhlomo says rape is not something to joke about. “This included threats to rape girls aged 7-10 years who are his neighbours in order to teach them a lesson. We have since instructed management of Prince Mshiyeni to remove this person immediately so he’s out of the hospital pending an investigation and the outcome of that investigation. As the MEC for health, I was also appointed by the Premier to be a provincial chair of the Men’s Forum where we motivate men to be protectors of families and society. We cannot then be talking about the need to protect and nature women and young girls on the other hand have in the mist people who harbour such violent repressive thoughts.”
