Western Cape premier Helen Zille has again resorted to social media to write about a contentious issue. Zille was previously been in trouble with her party, the DA, for the comments she made on social media about colonialism. This time she has shared her thoughts on Facebook on the alleged incident of racism at Rustenburg Girls Junior School in Cape Town. Teacher Nozipho Mthembu resigned last month citing racism and a lack of support as a first-year black teacher at the upmarket school. She has since reached an agreement with the school at the CCMA. Zille says the orchestrated attacks on the school have been unjust. She says she has inside knowledge and she respects the school for not saying why the teacher left. She says they are respecting her privacy, and taking pains to ensure that they do not destroy the prospects for her future career. She has chastised those people who are trying to whip this up into a race furore, saying they donâ€™t seem to care about the person or the facts, as long as they can get as much political capital out of the situation as possible. Zille has thanked the school for being loving and supportive, nurturing and caring to a child she has in the school, who happens to be black. See Facebook post below:
