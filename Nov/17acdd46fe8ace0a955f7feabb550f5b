In his closing remarks at the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture, Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan has once again appealed to all those who have evidence of wrongdoing on his part as former Finance Minister to come forward and give evidence to the Commission, under oath. He says he’s open to criticism on what he put forward as evidence to the commission, but has challenged the negative impact the threats have to the families of all those who are testifying before the Commission. Gordhan says the allegations of corruption on his part moving to the mentioning of his daughter must come to end. He says his daughter does not have business with the state. “Investec – that is the bank concerned… (Investec) is the owner of the shares that they buy, not my daughter. She was an employee in this division of these companies as a representative of Investec.” “The allegations of using the relationship with me to get access to government tenders to benefit these companies is a blatant lie, and these dangerous and unfounded allegations have been made to intimidate and harass my family and myself.” “She does not have any bank accounts in Canada and for the record, nor do I, and my daughter has not done any business with the state.” Click video below:
