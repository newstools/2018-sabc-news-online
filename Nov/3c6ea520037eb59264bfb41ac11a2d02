The National Treasury’s forensic report into allegations of financial misconduct at Eskom and Transnet has recommended that the Hawks investigate former Eskom executives: Matshela Koko, Anoj Singh, Suzanne Daniels, Ayanda Nteta and Edwin Mabelane. They allegedly received kickbacks for assisting the Gupta-owned company, Tegeta Exploration and Resources, to receive a controversial R650 million pre-payment to buy Optimum Coal Holdings Limited. The first part of the 600-page report compiled by Funduzi Forensic Services probes the procurement of locomotives at Transnet, while the second part looks into the procurement of consultancy services from McKinsey, Regiments and Trillian. The third section of the report addresses Eskom’s procurement of coal from Gupta-owned Tegeta. The report says Eskom executives may have received gratification for assisting Tegeta to secure the prepayment from Eskom.  It states that Tegeta would not have been able to acquire Optimum had it not been for a late-night special board tender committee meeting which resolved to grant Tegeta the pre-payment. The report further calls for a criminal investigation of Koko and Singh for possible criminal misconduct for misleading the parliamentary portfolio committee on public enterprises on the 3.5% discount they claimed to have negotiated with Tegeta for the prepayment. The report also found that government has lost more than R150 billion in irregularities at Eskom and Transnet. Several other executives and politicians have been implicated in wrongdoing in the report.
