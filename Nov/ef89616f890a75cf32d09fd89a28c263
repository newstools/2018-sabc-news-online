The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) has wished former Cape Town Mayor Patricia de Lille well on her plan to start a new political party. Earlier on Sunday, De Lille announced that she would start a new party which would contest next year’s general elections in all provinces in the country. She resigned as mayor and member of the Democratic Alliance (DA) last month after a long battle with the party’s leadership. De Lille says she will announce the name of her new party in two weeks’ time. “We wish her well, we welcome her back again, she was here before and she knows the terrain, so she must feel welcomed, she’s got a friend in the EFF. We’re together, let’s go and do the right thing. Let’s fight for our people, let’s defeat the demon of racism, which is what removed her from the DA, nothing, but arrogance of racism and she must come and join us in the fight against racism,” says EFF leader Julius Malema.
