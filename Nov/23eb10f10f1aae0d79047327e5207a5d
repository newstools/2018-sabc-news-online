Police Minister, Bheki Cele, says it’s all systems go for police officers to ensure safety during the festive season. Cele was delivering a keynote address during the launch of the National Safer Festive Season crime fighting campaign, at Motherwell in Port Elizabeth. In 2017 campaign is launched under the theme, Quiet Storm. The launch of this year’s festive season campaign began with a walk-about in a busy taxi rank at Motherwell, in Port Elizabeth. Cele and National Police Commissioner Khehla Sitole interacted with commuters.  They later participated in a roadblock on the N2 which links Makhanda, formerly known as Grahamstown, to Port Elizabeth. The festive season campaign will focus on aggravated robberies such as cash in transit robberies, unlicensed firearms, adherence to by-laws and traffic enforcement, crimes against women and children and enhancing border security. Cele says they won’t tolerate any criminal elements during the festive season.  “Criminals must run away, they must go and hide, because we are not going to give them space. We are not going to allow them to waste the time.  I did see my colleagues from Correctional Services; I don’t know what you are going to do at Correctional Services because we are going to be delivering more clients for you.” Cele also warned police officers to treat domestic violence cases with the respect they deserve.  “Don’t chase any woman that says she’s being abused by the husband, the boyfriend, the uncle, the father. Find that criminal and make sure that woman is safe.” Meanwhile Commissioner Sitole says they will ensure people move freely, without fear of criminals. “As we stem the authority of the state, we would like people to go to the public spaces freely, freely to touring areas and do their shopping freely without any hustles from criminals.” The Safer Festive Season Campaign will also be rolled out in other provinces. Police will conduct operations until January 2019.
