The City of Cape Town has rejected as skewed, the comments made by its former Mayoral Committee Member for Housing, Brett Herron,  that the City has no desire to integrate its citizens. Herron resigned from his position in the city council and his membership of the Democratic Alliance (DA) on Thursday, citing the alleged refusal of the city to support a low cost housing project in Salt River and Woodstock. Acting Mayor Ian Neilson says the social housing project in Salt River is undergoing further technical clarification at the moment. Before Herron’s resignation, seven other councillors resigned earlier in support of former mayor Patricia de Lille. Herron and De Lille are both implicated in wrongdoing by forensic reports commissioned by the DA. Click below for more:
