The Constitutional Court has dismissed Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba‘s application for leave to appeal the court ruling that he lied under oath in the Fireblade Aviation case. The country’s Apex Court dismissed Gigaba’s application with costs. The High Court in Pretoria earlier found that Gigaba had lied when he stated he had not approved a private air terminal for the Oppenheimer family in early 2016. Delivering a report on Public Protector Investigations on Wednesday, Busisiwe Mkhwebane, recommended in a report released on Thursday, that President Cyril Ramaphosa should take disciplinary action against Gigaba for lying under oath. Mkhwebane briefed the media on 13 reports she released after investigations. Click video below:
