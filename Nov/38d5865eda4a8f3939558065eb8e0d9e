Progress towards lasting peace was made in Lesotho on Monday. Differences appeared to have been ironed out at a national Dialogue of stakeholders including regional body SADC. The dialogue was opened by King Letsie III of Lesotho. He has urged wholesale reforms of the Constitution, Security, and Parliament among other things. Former Deputy Justice Dikgang Moseneke and three South African Deputy Ministers are part of the facilitation process. Both government and the opposition burying the hatchet, they have agreed to disagree in a bid to find lasting peace in the mountain Kingdom. King Letsie says, “More recently, this toxic atmosphere of political instability resulted in the deaths of two commanders of the LDF the incidents, which shook the nation to the core.” The king expressed concern about external influences meddling in the army. “Over the years, defence and security has been confronted with sustained and deliberating challenges of inter and intra institutional conflicts, which had a very negative impact on their ability to carry out their mandate.” There’s optimism that the desired objective was achieved. SADC facilitation Dikgang Ernest Moseneke says, “So, today are the first real fruits of that effort of coming together and I have chosen these few minutes, your majesty, to be grateful.” There was a small demonstration outside the venue.
