The EFF is investigating four of its members in the Western Cape for allegedly defrauding the party of R100 000. They include the party’s former provincial secretary and three municipal councillors. The party members allegedly received a donation from a wealthy businessman which was paid into an account of a company of which the four are listed as directors and not into the party’s account. EFF secretary-general Godrich Gardee says they have received a complaint from an unknown source with a thank you letter to an alleged donor for the amount of R100 000. Gardee says they view the allegations in a serious light. He says: “Whilst we were attempting to investigate this matter we read about it in the media and we will be investigating both the leakage to the media and also investigating the actual circumstances around the receipt of the donation, how it was used, how it was solicited and how it was received.”
