The North West Department of Education is optimistic that all plans it put in place to assist matric learners will yield positive results for the 2018 final examinations. The province encountered some challenges relating to normal schooling during the course of this year, including service delivery protests which led to the burning of some schools. “We had a plan wherein the learners will be camping at school and we carried out that plan without any hesitations. I must indicate that it was so successful. On the side of the learners we had those that were affected by the situation but one must indicate that due to the intervention of social services, they were addressed in terms of their social psycho problems and they are coping very well,” says Education MEC Sello Lehari.
