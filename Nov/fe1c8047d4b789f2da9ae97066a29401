Former National Treasury Director-General, Lungisa Fuzile, will continue with his testimony at the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture in Johannesburg on Thursday morning. He is expected to shed some light on what transpired during a meeting he held with former finance deputy minister, Mcebisi Jonas. The meeting discussed how Jonas ended up at the Saxonwold home of the controversial Gupta family. Wednesday, Fuzile testified about a telephone call he received from chairperson of the ANC’s subcommittee on economic transformation, Enoch Godongwana, to alert him that they would get what he termed a “Gupta minister”. “I kind of didn’t understand what he was saying. I asked Godongwana what he meant by this.  He said to me, you guys don’t talk to one another as director-generals. I said what do you mean we don’t talk. We do talk but not about what you’re talking about.  He said I would suggest that you have a conversation with your colleague Dr Tibedi Ramoncha who at the time was a director-general at Mineral Resources.” Watch related videos:   See comments on Twitter:
