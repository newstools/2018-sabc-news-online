Metrorail says train services are back to normal in the Naledi corridor of Soweto, in Johannesburg. This is after the service was disrupted on Wednesday due to cable theft between Dube and Ikwezi train stations, affecting an estimated over 60 000 commuters. Metrorail Gauteng spokesperson, Lilian Mofokeng says:”We have managed, through the hard work of our technical teams, to restore the line and replace both the cables that were stolen between Ikwezi and Dube stations.” “As of yesterday through the morning peak, we were able to operate as normal. It was a huge cable, because when they cut it, they took it away, and it damages our abilities to supply electricity to our trains making it very difficult for us to operate.” For full interview click video : <a href="https://iono.fm/e/625839">Content hosted by iono.fm</a>
