The Democratic Alliance (DA) is claiming that the R500 000 donation from Bosasa towards President Cyril Ramaphosa’s campaign to be ANC President was administered by a law firm whose director appears to have links to the Gupta family. In a statement, the opposition party says Jeffrey Afriat was a director at law firm Edelstein, Farber and Grobler (EFG) – the law firm which administered the trust account to which the donation was paid. It says Afriat served as one of three directors of Trillian Capital in 2016 – a company which allegedly was a primary vehicle used by the Guptas to capture the state. The DA is once again calling for President Cyril Ramaphosa to appoint an independent inquiry, headed by a retired judge, to be selected by the Chief Justice, to fully investigate the Bosasa scandal.
