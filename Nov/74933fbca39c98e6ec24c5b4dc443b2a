The African National Congress (ANC) is to host political parties from the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) countries next month.   The ANC’s subcommittee chairperson on international relations Lindiwe Zulu says the meeting will discuss the role of political parties in enhancing relations among the countries. The meeting comes at a time when the participation of Brazil hangs in the balance. The country has elected a far right leader who does not support socialist policies. Minister of International Relations Lindiwe Sisulu says the President will soon contact Brazilian President Michel Temer.  Temer , a new man at the helm has already ruffled feathers. He is a strong far right leader whose campaign is focussed on fighting corruption and reversing socialist policies. As the ANC prepares to host other parties from the member countries it is not clear who is going to represent Brazil. However ANC NEC Member Lindiwe Sisulu says the party is hopeful that Brazil will attend the meeting. The South African government has congratulated the new president and Pretoria is optimistic that relations between the two countries will continue after the new president takes office. Sisulu says President Cyril Ramaphosa will soon communicate with the new Brazilian President. South Africa is the current chair of BRICS and will hand over the reigns to Brazil next month. The new president will take up the post in January. Click below for more on the story:
