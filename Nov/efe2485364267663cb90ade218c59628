Female pupils have implicated more teachers in a sex scandal at a high school in Manguzi on the KwaZulu-Natal north coast. The school has been in the news following allegations of a teacher understood to have impregnated five pupils. The teacher allegedly forced one learner to abort a baby, and is denying the paternity of one child, and victimised a matric pupil for refusing to sleep with him. The teacher has since disappeared â€“ following the SABC expose last week. Three other teachers are now also being implicated in the scandal. Some pupils accuse three other teachers of selling good marks in exchange for sex. Police remain on high alert in the area. This after reports that the community threatened to go on a rampage and shut down the school. WATCH VIDEO BELOW:
