Minister in the Presidency responsible for Women, Bathabile Dlamini, has re-iterated the call for people to speak out against gender-based violence – under the United Nations theme, #HearMeToo. Dlamini was briefing the media in Pretoria on this year’s programme for 16 Days of Activism Against Gender-Based Violence. The campaign officially commences on Sunday. Dlamini has encouraged South Africans to campaign alongside her department using #HearMeToo on social media platforms, in communities, work environments and schools. “We call upon all South Africans to heed the UN theme #HereMeToo by breaking all forms of silence against all manners of abuses and violence against women. The #HereMeToo theme symbolises a collective appeal to society to hear women’s pain and demands against gender based violence. #HereMeToo is also a call to action to all victims, survivors, witnesses and all other affected to continue to speak up in any manner about or against violence.” Watch related video:
