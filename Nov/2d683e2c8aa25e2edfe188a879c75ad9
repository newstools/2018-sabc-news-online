The Human Rights Commission (HRC) says the raw sewage spillage from a waste water treatment plant  in Randfontein on Gauteng’s West Rand is violating people’s rights. HRC officials embarked on a site inspection of the plant following complains from residents about the overpowering stench. The commission has found that an incinerator that is supposed to treat the solid waste was not working. This results in sewage spilling into the Rietspruit river and onto the Hartbeespoort Dam. The commission’s Buang Jones says the Rand West local municipality must provide answers. “So the way forward is that the Commission will summon the leadership of the municipality to appear before the Commission before the end of the month, to answer to some of these allegations, also provide the Commission with an action plan on how they are going to address all these concerns pertaining to the sewage reticulation and sewage works.”
