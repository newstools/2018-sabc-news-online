The South African Broadcasting Corporation’s (SABC) consultative process on the possible retrenchment of 981 permanent and non-renewal of contracts of 1200 freelancers will begin in Johannesburg on Tuesday. The 60-day process will involve SABC management, the workers unions Media Workers’ Association of South Africa (MWASA), Communication Workers’ Union (CWU) and Broadcasting, Electronic, Media and Allied Workers’ Union (BEMAWU) and other stakeholders. This is in line with Section 189 of the Labour Relations Act in the process which the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA) will facilitate. SABC Group Executive Human Resources, Jonathan Thekiso, said last week that should the retrenchments go ahead staff would be notified at the beginning of February next year.
