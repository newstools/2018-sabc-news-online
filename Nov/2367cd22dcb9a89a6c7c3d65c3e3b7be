Chief Executive Officer of the Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (OUTA), Wayne Duvenhage, says it’s time for government to concede that the e-tolls are not in the best interest of the country. The organisation has joined the ANC and Cosatu, whose members have started to gather in Pretoria, in readiness for a march to the Union Buildings to hand over a memorandum to the Presidency. The move is in response to Finance Minister Tito Mboweni’s Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement, when he made it clear that he was against the scrapping of the e-tolls. Mboweni also urged motorists to pay their e-toll bills to ensure that the country had a road transport infrastructure that worked. There have been widespread calls for the scrapping of the e-toll system. Duvenhage says government should come to terms with reality. He adds,”We’re not saying that we’re not going pay for infrastructure. Social infrastructure like these need to be paid for, that’s why we pay taxes. These are roads we use daily to get to and from work. These are not long distance routes to Komatipoort, Durban or Limpopo. These are the roads we use daily. It is crazy to subject this province to raise 34 per cent of Sanrals’s revenue. It’s not gonna happen.”
