The Chairperson of Parliament’s Standing Committee on Finance, Yunus Carrim, has reiterated that he does not know of any money from VBS Mutual Bank which was allegedly given to the South African Communist Party (SACP). This stems from media reports that a branch manager at the bank was ordered to pay the SACP’s R3 million bill for the use of a Boksburg hotel where the party held its 14th national congress. This seems to agree with the statement made by Tshifhiwa Matodzi, Former chairman of VBS Mutual Bank, which was that the SACP is one of the parties that benefited from VBS. Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) Chief Whip Floyd Shivambu called on Carrim to recuse himself from presiding over the committee’s hearing on VBS bank last week claiming he was conflicted as an SACP senior member. Carrim elaborates, “I know nothing of any contribution or whatsoever of the VBS mutual to the SACP. Secondly I spoke to both the general secretary of the SACP, Blade Nzimande, and the national treasury, Joyce Moropa. Both of them they say they know nothing about such money. I saw on TV on Saturday the general secretary of the party repeated that the SACP received no such money.” Reneva Fourie the Head of the office of the SACP’s Central Committee Secretariat says that all accusations are false and that legal action will be taken for the false allegations. “When we saw the headlines, Saturday evening. We then went back to our list of sponsorships. We communicated with all the people that donated to us. We requested from them that they give us a confirmation in writing that they are not subsidiaries from VBS or Vele Investment. We also then checked on the database, the company profiles, just to make very certain that the allegations in the article is false.” Watch related videos:
