Finance Minister Tito Mboweni said on Thursday that struggling state-run South African Airways (SAA) should be closed down, adding that decisions over the future of the state carrier were not under his remit. SAA, which has not generated a profit since 2011, survives on state guarantees and is regularly cited by credit ratings agencies as a drain on the government purse. “It’s loss-making, we are unlikely to sort out the situation, so my view would be close it down,” Mboweni told an investor conference in New York televised live on SABC News. “Why I say close it down, it is because it’s unlikely that you are going to find any private sector equity partner who will come join this asset,” Mboweni added. In August, President Cyril Ramaphosa transferred oversight of SAA to the Public Enterprises ministry which is led by Pravin Gordhan from the Finance ministry. Ramaphosa has pledged to revive struggling state firms, including SAA. SAA CEO Vuyani Jarana has said he is mapping out a punishing austerity plan to turn the flag carrier around. He has said layoffs and other cuts were unavoidable. In a dramatic fall from grace over the past decade, SAA has lost its place as Africa’s biggest airline and a symbol of patriotic pride to become a source of frustration for taxpayers who have forked out more than R30 billion since 2012 to keep it in the air.
