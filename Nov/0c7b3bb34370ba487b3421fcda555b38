The SABC has learned that former African National Congress (ANC) Northern Cape Chairperson John Block has started serving his 15-year jail sentence at the Kimberley Correctional Centre on Tuesday. Block and Trifecta Director Christo Scholtz were convicted for corruption and money laundering in 2016 by the Kimberley High Court. The two were found guilty in the case relating to multimillion-rand property tenders awarded by the Northern Cape government departments â€“ over a two year period starting in 2006. The money laundering charge was however dismissed by the Supreme Court of Appeal. The two lost their leave to appeal their sentence at the constitutional court last week. Watch related videos:
