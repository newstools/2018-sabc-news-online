Former Public Enterprises Minister Barbara Hogan has revealed to the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture, that while she was compiling evidence for the Commission she sought help from her previous ministry, but upon receiving the necessary documents she learnt that some of her documents from 2009 had been tampered with, and some of her emails deleted. Hogan is continuing to give testimony before the Commission, underway in Parktown in Johannesburg. She served as Minister from 2009 until 2010. Hogan has told the Commission of interference by then President Jacob Zuma, in respect of  appointments, especially that of the Transnet Chief Executive Officer. Hogan has explained some difficulties in obtaining the documents. She says the African National Congress (ANC) used undue influence to interfere with executive appointments at state-owned enterprises. Hogan says the Boards appointed to SOEs and the portfolio ministers were responsible for executive appointments at SOEs, not the ruling party. She says Zuma interfered with her executive responsibilities as a minister. Hogan has called into question the value of the ANC’s Deployment Committee which influences the appointment of individuals. “ I sincerely wonder if a Deployment committee plays a useful role now. If you see the number of appointments that go to cabinet every time… It’s huge numbers of people, you don’t know how many institutions government has got – and for a handful of people just simply to decide that this is their preferred candidate on what basis, what transparency is there?
