Five suspects arrested during a botched cash in transit heist in Qwaqwa in the Free State on Thursday have appeared in the local magistrate’s court. Their case has been postponed to 29 November. The suspects were armed with pistols and high calibre rifles. They were arrested during a shootout with the police when they attempted to rob a cash van. One of their accomplices has been shot and killed. They are facing charges of attempted murder, possession of unlicensed firearms, and possession of suspected stolen motor vehicles. “A decision was taken based on the seriousness of the case… we managed to get space for them to appear in court and they were remanded in custody until 29 November – investigations are continuing,” says Brigadier Hangwani Mulaudzi, Hawks spokesperson.
