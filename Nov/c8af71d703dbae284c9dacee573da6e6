City of Tshwane Executive Mayor Solly Msimanga says he will subject himself to a probe following a call by the embattled Municipal Manager Dr Moeketsi Mosola. Mosola has accused Msimanga of leaking the Bowman Gilfillanâ€™s report to the media. The report contains the findings of the probe into Mosola. He has been under investigations for alleged corruption in connection with a multi-million rand tender awarded to Glad Africa. Last month, Mosola was granted an interim court interdict preventing the council from tabling the report. Msimanga says Mosola has embarked on a smear campaign to attack the council and its leadership through media platforms. The mayor addressed the media in Pretoria on Wednesday afternoon.
