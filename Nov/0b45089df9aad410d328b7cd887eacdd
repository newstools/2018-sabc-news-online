One of the disgruntled VBS Mutual Bank depositors wants those responsible for the looting of the bank to face the full might of the law. Elisa Mudau of Tshilungoma outside Thohoyandou in Limpopo invested R600 000 in VBS.  The Thulamela municipal employee says she has been sick since the looting at VBS came to light in March. Mudau wants the liquidators to pay individual depositors first before paying other debts. Fifty nine-year-old Mudau, a mother of five, has been saving over the years for the future of her children and grandchildren. She is among thousands of VBS depositors who were only allowed to withdraw a maximum of R100 000 from their accounts. Mudau says she needs to access the remaining money to pay for tuition and other needs for her child who is at a tertiary institution. Without mentioning names, she wants those implicated in the VBS forensic report to leave their positions of leadership. Among those implicated in the report are the African National Congress (ANC) provincial Deputy Chairperson who is also Vhembe executive mayor, Florence Radzilani, ANC Treasurer, Danny Msiza, and VhaVenda King Toni Mphephu Ramabulana. On Tuesday, the Pretoria High Court granted an order for the bank to be liquidated. “They must start with ordinary people who have saved their money with the bank. The municipalities will come after because municipalities are being run by people who stole the money. They must start with the citizens because the municipality is there to assist people they won’t be a municipality without the community. The president should release people who aren’t faithful from leadership positions,” explains Mudau. The Reserve Bank says a liquidator will be appointed to wind down the bank. –Additional reporting by Aluwani Mantsha  WATCH BELOW:
