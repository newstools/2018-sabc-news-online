The roads next to the High Court in Pietermaritzburg have been closed and security tightened ahead of former president Jacob Zuma’s appearance in court Friday morning. The NPA is likely to request an adjournment to give it time to respond to both Zuma and his co-accused French arms company Thales’ application for a permanent stay of prosecution. The charges against Zuma and Thales relate to the more than 780 allegedly questionable payments. Some of Zuma’s supporters attended a night vigil. The court was already abuzz from early with police and some supporters of Jacob Zuma. A march is to kick off few kilometres from court to be led by religious leaders. Various messages, some on placards and t shirts are written with the words “Hands off Zuma’. Police are also out in numbers to monitor the proceedings. Later Friday  Zuma is expected to address those who have continuously shown him support in and out of courts.
