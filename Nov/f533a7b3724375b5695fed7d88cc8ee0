The Democratic Alliance‘s Dan Plato has been elected as Cape Town’s new executive mayor. During a special council sitting, Plato was elected by a majority, receiving 146 votes out of 208. Plato was sworn in as a councilor last week after Patricia De Lille announced her resignation as mayor as well as a member of the Democratic Alliance. Speaking after being sworn in, Plato pledged to start his term by recruiting more metro police officers. “I want to give the people of this city a chance to engage with us and I am calling on them to not let gatekeepers undermine them. Make sure the people that represent you have your best interest at heart and are not using you for political gain. When your neighbours damage public infrastructure, let my office know. They are breaking infrastructure you worked hard for. Don’t allow it. One of my first things will be to recruit more metro police for CTN. They cannot replace the role of the SAPS but I will make sure that the city does what it can to make our communities safer.”
