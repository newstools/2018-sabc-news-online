The trial of five men accused of killing a Democratic Alliance (DA) councillor elect and his business partner in an alleged political hit, continues in the Kimberley High Court. DA councillor elect Johannes Baaitjie and business partner Shuping Nouse were shot execution style days before Baaitjie was to be sworn in as a councillor in the Kgatelopele Municipality at Danielskuil in the Northern Cape, following his victory in the 2016 local government elections. In continuation of his testimony on Tuesday afternoon, the investigating officer said he went to look for accused number three because, after there was a strong indication that the message sent to Baaitjie to lure him to his death, was sent via his cellphone. Detectives found out after they were given two numbers by accused number five when he went to look for accused number three at his residents to arrest him, and could not find him. Accused number five was then implicated after detectives interviewed two witnesses who saw both suspects driving down the street at high speed. The case continues on Wednesday morning.
