A survey by Afrobarometer has shown that it is important for South Africans to prioritise the return of land taken during forced removals since the 1913 Land Act. This as lobby group, Afriforum is requesting the High Court in Cape Town to halt the debate on the Constitutional Review Committee’s report on Section 25 of the constitution. The report, which was adopted more than a week ago, recommends that Section 25 be amended to make provisions for the expropriation of land without compensation. Afrobarometer spokesperson, Sbusiso Nkomo says the survey was conducted between August and September. He says: “We spoke to 1 800 South Africans across the country. About 84% of them have state that the redistribution of land forcibly taken should be a priority. Agricultural land and urban vacant land are importantly identified.” Related Video
