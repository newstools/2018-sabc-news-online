Consumer experts have called on bargain hunters to avoid buying items on credit and to steer clear from borrowing money for Black Friday shopping. The annual ritual of Black Friday is a shopping phenomenon that gives consumers the opportunity to buy different items at a supposedly, low price. In South Africa, many shops promise 50% off selected goods. However,  consumer experts say those who take advantage of Black Friday should ask themselves if the bargains are really worth it. “Sadly, it seems that a lot of marketing and advertising around Black Friday is focused on luxury items. They focus on flatscreens, gadgets, cameras and all the latest technology which people don’t really need, especially in this economic climate. People should make a list of priorities what they really need in their homes. Let’s not let retailers dictate to us what we need. Think for yourself. Do I need it? Can I live without it,” says Consumer Expert, Lyse Commins.
