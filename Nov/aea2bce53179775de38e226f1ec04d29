Former Cape Town mayor, Patricia de Lille, says her idea of a new political movement is one that’s going to positively change the political landscape in South Africa. De Lille is expected to announce the name of her new political party soon, aiming to contest the 2019 elections in all provinces. She resigned as the City’s executive mayor and from the DA last month after an 18-month battle with the party. De Lille says she is willing to take the risk of disrupting the country’s current political trajectory She says: “I have consulted with my mentors, family and thousands of people have come forward in the past two weeks, drawing up a petition asking me to start a political movement that could be more positive and build a good South Africa. I’ve made a decision on the basis of evidence and it is now up to South Africans to decide whether the contestation of ideas and the idea of a good South Africa and good people coming together will succeed. I am prepared to take that leap of faith and test the idea.”
