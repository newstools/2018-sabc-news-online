More revelations on state capture are expected to be heard when Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan appears before the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture in Parktown, Johannesburg, on Monday morning. Gordhan’s testimony is eagerly anticipated after former Public Enterprises Minister Barbara Hogan concluded her testimony last week.  Hogan detailed former president Jacob Zuma’s alleged interference in the running of state-owned enterprises. Gordhan is expected to detail his time as Finance Minister when he was first appointed in 2009 by then President Jacob Zuma and just like former Minister Barbara Hogan, it is expected that Gordhan will also implicate Zuma in his testimony. Just over a week ago, Gordhan’s sworn statement was leaked to the media where he confirmed to have met the Guptas. He is expected to unpack meetings with the controversial family. The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) are expected to protest at the inquiry. EFF leader Julius Malema says they believe Gordhan was involved in the state capture project. “One of the questions we’re asking Pravin is how did you become Minister of Finance. Are you aware of a meeting which took place with President Zuma, where certain people asked President Zuma to make you Minister of Finance? We detail those questions because the Guptas were able to do what they did because of Zuma being assisted by Pravin. He’s an enabler of state capture, he must answer honourably and honestly.” Watch related videos:
