The ANC and Cosatu will on Friday morning march to the Union Buildings in Pretoria to hand over a memorandum to the Presidency. The memorandum will demand the scrapping of the controversial e-toll system. The move is in response to Finance Minister Tito Mboweni’s Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement, when he made it clear that he was against the scrapping of e-tolls. Mboweni also urged motorists to pay their e-toll bills to ensure that the country had a road transport infrastructure that worked. There have been widespread calls for the scrapping of the e-toll system. ANC Gauteng spokesperson Tasnim Motala says government must rethink continuing with such a system. “What we are presenting are alternative payment methods to be able to settle the debt. A few years ago we had presented an option of adding on to the fuel levy. That is no longer an option of course, considering that the price of fuel has increased drastically over time.”
