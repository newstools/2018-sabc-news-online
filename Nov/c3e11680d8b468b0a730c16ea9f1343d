Sergeant Banele Ndlovu testified that the two Vlakfontein murder accused were in constant communication during the killings of Khoza family. Ndlovu was under cross examination in the Protea Magistrates court, Soweto. On Wednesday Mpumalanga born Ernest Mabaso detailed how he raped and killed the seven family members. He also implicated his co-accused Fita Khupe as the mastermind of the multiple murders. Both are charged with murder and theft. Mabaso faces additional charges of rape and robbery. Ndlovu testified that Mabaso would not be safe if granted bail and police custody was the only option. Mabaso’s legal counsel detailed graphically through an affidavit how members of the Khoza family died. He alleges Khupe gave him a hammer, instructing him to strike each victim on the head twice. In Khupe’s statement he denied Mabaso’s version of events. He says he wasn’t in the country. Mabaso claims the killings were a revenge attack on the Khozas. Click video below:
