The Kathrada family in Schweizer Reneke in the North West has called for the imposition of a harsh sentence to the men accused of killing two of their family members earlier this month. The eight suspects linked to the murders made their second appearance before the Schweizer Reneke Magistrate’s court on Wednesday. Five abandoned their bail application. Members of the community came in numbers to support the family of struggle icon Ahmed Kathrada. Carrying placards, they thronged the court’s precincts. Security was intensified in and outside the court. The nine suspects are charged with shooting and killing the nephew of struggle icon Ahmed Kathrada, and his father Yunus Kathrada. “I think the justice system must take this matter more seriously not only this one must reinforce the police in Schwizer Reneke and in other towns that must have this kind of criminal element. We have young people who are gangsters in this town. You know we have young people who are disrupting meetings and this is a tendency going on in these little towns orchestrated by people who are known to the SAPS and I think the SAPS hands are tight.” The suspects will remain in custody until their next court appearance next month. “Nine suspects appeared, the matter was on the roll today for arrangements of bail application. Applicant number one, three and seven their matters have been postponed to bring their formal application on the December 5, 2018. Other suspects they abandoned their bail application.” The ninth suspect who is a minor in the case is in custody at a juvenile facility.
