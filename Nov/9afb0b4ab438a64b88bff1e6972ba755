Hundreds of people, mainly women, are attending the official launch of the 16 days of Activism against Gender based violence. The launch is being hosted by Minister for Women in the Presidency Bathabile Dlamini at KwaMagwaza area of Melmoth on the KwaZulu-Natal north coast. The minister is expected to outline activities for the next coming two weeks. This year’s theme is ‘HearMetoo’, end violence against women and children. 2018 saw a number of marches raising awareness about violence against women and children – including the #TotalShutDown march in August. Activists called for harsher sentences for abusers. A number of women have also died and been brutally attacked, some by their partners and former partners. Last week minister Bathabile Dlamini attended dialogues in KwaZulu-Natal where she had an opportunity to listen to young girls. The dialogues are part of a broader campaign to help women speak about their challenges and provide solutions where possible. CLICK VIDEO BELOW:
