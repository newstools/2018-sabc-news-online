An investigating officer in a cash-in-transit heist that took place in Matlhonyane village outside Mahikeng a month ago, testified against the granting of bail to eleven suspects. Captain Koketso Ntsimane says more arrests are imminent as some suspects are still at large and believed to be in Gauteng. According to police, Qolile Qoma who was the first to be arrested few days after a private security company van was robbed off one point five million rand in cash, confessed to police about the heist. During the arrest of 11 suspects, only R37 000 was recovered from them and larger cash is believed to be with the other suspects who are still at large. Ntsimane says his opposition to the granting of bail is to allow the police to verify the physical addresses of the accused and also to establish any pending cases or previous criminal records. During his latest crime stats in September, Police Minister Bheki Cele said that cash-in-transit heists stats have gone up by 50% in 2018. The Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) has developed new technologies to assist in stopping cash-in-transit heists across the country. Watch related video below:
