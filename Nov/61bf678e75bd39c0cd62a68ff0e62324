The family of the late former African National Congress (ANC) President Albert Luthuli, says they need closure regarding the death of the stalwart. They say they believe he was killed by the Apartheid government. The Luthuli family says an inquest into his  death is expected to start next month. Members of the community have the joined the family attending the 14th Chief Albert Luthuli memorial lecture at the University of KwaZulu Natal’s Westville Campus in Durban. Luthuli’s grandson Mthunzi says: “We have always known as the family that Chief Luthuli was not hit by the train. We’ve always known that he was murdered. We’ve always known that but what we do not know is who ordered it and who carried it out. Looking at circumstances surrounding his death on the day there’s enough for us to get to the truth and we believe that certainly by the end of next year we should be in a position to know exactly what had happened.” WATCH RELATED VIDEO:
