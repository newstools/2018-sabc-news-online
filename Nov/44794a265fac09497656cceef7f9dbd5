Property rights activist Petrus Sitho has warned government that the expropriation of land without compensation would worsen the current unemployment situation and further harm the already struggling economy. Opposition parties say they will await the conclusion of the Parliamentary process before deciding whether or not to take to court the report on the proposed land expropriation amendment. The Constitutional Review Committee has adopted a report that recommends the amendment of section 25 of the constitution to allow for the expropriation of land without compensation. This is despite objections from some opposition parties that the process that the committee followed was flawed. Sitho says government should instead focus on poverty alleviation. He says poverty is the biggest problem facing the country. “This expropriation of land without compensation is taking us backwards like in Zimbabwe and Venezuela. People must open their eyes and their minds. We have a beautiful country and we are supposed to focus on our freedom but we are now trapped, worse than before,” says Sitho. Related Video
