President Cyril Ramaphosa has described the changes he has made in his cabinet as the first wave of government realignment. He has merged the Departments of Communications with Telecommunications and Postal Services to be headed by the new Minister Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams. He has also moved Dr Siyabonga Cwele to the Home Affairs portfolio and with Nomvula Mokonyane replacing the late Edna Molewa as the new minister of Environmental Affairs. With just few months to go before the crucial 2019 national elections, President Cyril Ramaphosa was cautious not to make sweeping changes during his second cabinet reshuffle since taking office in February 2018. But he has shown confidence in the young Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams and retained his old ministers to ensure continuity. Although the Communications and the Telecommunications and Postal Services were collapsed into a single department, the president said the two ministries will remain independent until 2024. He said these are necessary changes to ensure a responsive and effective government. Meanwhile, the Deputy Minister of Energy Tembi Majola has asked to be relieved of her duties with effect from January 2019. Click below for more on the story:
