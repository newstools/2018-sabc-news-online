Former President Thabo Mbeki is expected to brief Tanzanian President, John Magufuli, on the impact of illicit financial flows on his country. Mbeki chairs the African Union High Level Panel on Illicit Financial Flows. While Magufuli is known for clamping down on unnecessary and irregular expenditure since he came to power, Tanzania, like other African countries continues to lose billions. The amount of money lost by African countries through illicit flows annually is approximately $80 billion dollars. The funds are lost through multi-national corporations such as oil and gas in Nigeria, banking and financial services as well as failure to pay tax. Mbeki will brief Tanzania on how it is performing in curbing the scourge since the panel was launched in 2012.
