Sentencing procedures are expected to get underway in the High Court in Cape Town on Wednesday, in the trial of former property mogul, Jason Rohde. Rohde was found guilty two weeks ago for his wife Susan’s murder at the Spier Wine Estate near Stellenbosch in July 2016. She was beaten and strangled. Rohde has also been convicted on a charge of obstructing the administration of justice. The 47-year-old mother of three was found in the bathroom of the hotel in what the defence insisted was a suicide. Rohde’s bail of R1 million has been revoked. His lawyers have indicated that they will apply for leave to appeal his conviction. Related Video
