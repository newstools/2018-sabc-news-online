Convicted rapist, and former tennis star Bob Hewitt has been denied an application to convert his prison sentence to house arrest. The 78-year-old Hewitt was sentenced to six years in prison for the rape of two young women and the sexual assault of another one whom he coached in the 1980s. His application was rejected by the Correctional Supervision and Parole Board. Department of Correctional Services spokesperson, Singabakho Nxumalo says the reasons for the denial of his application won’t be made public. “It was a lengthy process which included submissions which included different parties which also includes the victims of crime.” “So it is a decision that it was also communicated to us as the department. So will just have to inform the parties that the application was not approved and Hewitt will continue to serve his sentence as determined by the court.” Related video click below:
