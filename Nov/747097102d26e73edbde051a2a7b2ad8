The City of Cape Town says the newly-reduced water restriction from Level 5 to Level 3 will come into effect Saturday. The lowered restrictions mean that residents can now use 105 litres of water per person, per day compared to the previous 70 litres. Mayor Dan Plato told a media briefing in Cape Town that this also meant residents could now enjoy lowered tariffs for their water consumption up to 35 and half per cent less while the 40% restriction on business usage had been completely scrapped. “The City of Cape Town water users can expect a considerable reduction in the cost of water to be reflected in their invoices during next month. This is due to the lowering of water restrictions from level 5 to level 3, recovery restrictions from Saturday, December 1, 2018.” Watch related video:
