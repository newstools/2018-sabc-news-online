Parliament has joined the nation in demanding an end to crimes against women and children as the country marks 16 Days of activism against gender-based violence. Members of different political parties in Parliament have lamented the problem of domestic violence in the country. The Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) Member of Parliament Liezel van der Merwe has accused government of failing to create enough centres to counsel the victims of violence. “Almost half of government treatment centres do not offer counselling services for survivors. It’s a story of a broken system. A broken system, that is failing our women and children. President Cyril Ramaphosa recently admitted that gender violence against women and children is a crisis that is tearing our society and he was right, but besides rhetoric’s honourable president – where is the action.” Watch related video:
