The South African National Editors’ Forum has sought an urgent meeting with the leadership of the Economic Freedom Fighters, following concerns over utterances attributed to the party’s leader, Julius Malema. This after Malema – addressing party supporters outside the state capture commission, accused some journalists of protecting certain politicians. Malema also likened the media to the apartheid government’s “STRATCOM” disinformation campaign. Sanef says since Malema’s comments, some of the journalists he mentioned by name have been physically accosted and also abused on social media. Sanef’s Executive Director Kate Skinner gives clarity on the matter.
