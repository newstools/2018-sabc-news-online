Crop farmers in Oudtshoorn, Dysselsdorp and De Rust in the Western Cape say they are in for a rough time ahead due to dwindling water resources in the area. While the local Raubenheimer Dam is 44% full, irrigation dams, such as the Kammanassie and Stompdrif Dams, are only five and 6% full respectively. One hundred and fifty crop farmers are unable to water their crops. They have asked seed production companies falling under SANSOR to help them get water from the Orange River Scheme. Only livestock farmers have received assistance during the drought. WATCH BELOW
