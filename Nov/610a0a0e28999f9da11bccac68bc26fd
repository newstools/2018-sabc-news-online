Judgment has been reserved at the Labour Court in the case of members of Parliament’s Protections Services who are challenging the institution for alleged discrimination with regard to their salaries. In their court papers, the 70 employees say the so called ‘bouncers’ – who have on occasion removed rowdy EFF MPs from the National Assembly – are paid much higher salaries. Parliament argues that the bouncers – all former police officers – were specifically recruited to deal with high intensity security situations. The attorney for the disgruntled group, and also DA MP, Michael Bagraim, explains, “New people who are less qualified than them are earning more money. The essence of that is that our law does not allow for you to have two people in exactly the same job in exactly the same set of circumstances, the one earning more and other earning less.” Watch related video:
