Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) first deputy president Mike Shingange says they will take to the streets to remove officials and politicians involved in the VBS Mutual Bank scandal, if the African National Congress NEC fails to take decisive action against them. The Labour federation has led a series of marches to various municipalities which illegally deposited money into VBS Mutual Bank. Shingange was leading a protest march at the Ephraim Mogale municipality in Marble Hall. “We are making the same call here to provincial treasury of the ANC, the provincial deputy chairperson of the ANC, to all the mayors, the municipal managers and the CFO that if they don’t want to be pushed by us, we don’t mind what the ANC is going to say in the NEC – if they decide to save them; we will be on the street to make sure that we push them out.” “We are now going to continue to fight and we want President Cyril Ramaphosa to lead us to make sure that people are arrested.” Related video click below:
