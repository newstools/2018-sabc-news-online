The Constitutional Court has granted the Electoral Commission (IEC) an extension to collect and verify the addresses of all registered voters on the voters’ roll. The IEC had approached the court to ask for a further extension until November 29, 2019. This will be after the 2019 national elections. In its 2016 judgment, the court held that the IEC’s failure to compile a voters’ roll with valid addresses was inconsistent with the Constitution. The court had given the Electoral Commission until June 30 this year to complete the addresses for all registered voters on the voters’ roll. However, they have been unable to meet the deadline. Justice Ian Cameron handed down the ruling. “The following order is made; the declaration of invalidity in paragraph five of Hlope is further suspended until November 30, 2019. The suspension is subject to the following conditions: the commission must by November 30, 2019 have obtained and recorded on the national voters’ roll all addresses that were reasonably available to it.” Watch related videos:
