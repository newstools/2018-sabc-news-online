With only two days left before the close of applications for funding for 2019, the National Student Financial Aid Scheme, NSFAS is urging those who need funding not to wait until the last minute to apply. The deadline for funding application expires at midnight on Friday. The scheme says of the almost 300 000 applications received last week, almost 45 000 have missing supporting documents. NSFAS administrator Randall Carollisen says applications have peaked significantly ahead of Friday’s deadline. “We’ve seen a spike in the number of applications from an average of 3200 earlier, to more than 13 000 applications which we received last year. We expect to receive over 90 000 applications for this week and more than 400 000 in total for the year. We encourage learners, out of school youth, people with disabilities, not to wait until the last hour, but to apply now before 30 November.” Click below for more on the story:
