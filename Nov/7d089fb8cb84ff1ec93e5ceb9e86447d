The Co-Chair of Parliament’s Joint Finance committee, Yunnis Carrim, says remarks by Finance minister, Tito Mboweni that SAA should be closed down and a new airline established is not ANC policy. The struggling state airline has survived on state guarantees for seven years and was granted a further R5 billion in Mboweni’s Mid-Term Policy Budget statement last month. Carrim spoke during a meeting of the committee where National Treasury appeared to discuss the 2018 Revised Fiscal Framework. Treasury has told MPs that the drain of state-owned enterprises on the country’s finances is becoming a very heavy burden. Its deputy director general, Ismail Momoniat, says in order for the economy to grow, they have to make some changes. “He is saying there are no holy cows, saying we need to look at these issue, certainly as Treasury we agree strongly with the minister there are no holy cows these questions have to be posed. ultimately the budget is about trade offs if you want higher growth, you’re going to have to cut down on recurring expenditure.” But Carrim says as far as he is concerned, the ruling party has not changed its stance on the airline. “Until we hear from the finance minister, our position is guided by the ANC position we are accountable to the party we come from. Until now our understanding is a strategic equity partner and variety of partners from the private sector.” Carrim also added that the committee welcomes the decision by President Cyril Ramaphosa to dismiss SARS boss, Tom Moyane, following the recommendation of judge Robert Nugent, the chairperson of the SARS commission of inquiry. “We feel that the president had no other choice but to do what he did. In view of what is emerging over past four years…and the commissioner failing to present his side, I guess it was his choice so I think we can say we welcome it.” Watch video below:
