The South African Weather Service says Gauteng residents should expect hot temperatures in the coming week due to a lack of rainfall. Temperatures in Pretoria, Johannesburg and Vereeniging will vary between the low and mid-30s from Monday until Saturday. The north of the province will experience the highest temperatures with Pretoria predicted to peak at 35 degrees Celcius on Thursday. The highest temperatures forecast for Johannesburg and Vereeniging are 33 and 32 degrees Celcius on Friday respectively. Forecaster Vanetia Phakola says: “We are expecting the temperatures to start warming up from the cooling that we had the past few days. We will keep monitoring the temperatures. They might even go higher than that and if they do there might be a possibility of heat wave. At the moment the temperatures have not reached that criteria; so we are not seeing potential for a heat wave yet.” Meanwhile Johannesburg Emergency Services have urged residents to stay hydrated and keep cool throughout the week. Spokesperson, Robert Mulaudzi says: “Drink lots of water to avoid heat cramps and heat exhaustion which might cause heat stroke.” “EMS will remain in high alert to be able to respond to any emergencies which might be related to these extremely hot temperatures,” Mulaudzi.
