While Republicans in the United States have picked up key Senate seats to retain the chamber, several networks have called the House of Representatives for Democrats. Democrats needed at least 23 Republican seats to take control of the House and appear on track to achieve that. Democratic incumbents Joe Donnelly of Indiana and Heidi Heitkamp failed to retain their seats while popular candidate Beto O’Rouke failed to unseat incumbent Ted Cruz in Texas despite a competitive race. Democrats are also slightly trailing in a key Senate race in Florida where incumbent Democrat Bill Nelson is facing Republican Governor Rick Scott. Up to 12 Senate races remain outstanding with votes incoming. Voting is still underway in Western States and will later close in Hawaii and Alaska. Democrats are leading in as many as 30 house districts currently held by Republicans, needing just 23 to take control of the lower house. Polling had shown that Republicans would retain control of the Senate with Democrats winning back the House while they’ve also made gains in several key Governor races
