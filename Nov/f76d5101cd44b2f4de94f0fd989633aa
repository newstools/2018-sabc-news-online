The much anticipated Lesotho National Dialogue for Reforms and the country’s coalition government hang in the balance. This follows a Constitutional Court ruling that nullified an amnesty clause. The clause paved the way for the return of opposition leader Mothetjoa Metsing. Metsing had demanded temporary amnesty after being in exile in South Africa for more than a year, and the parties signed an agreement to allow this, but the Constitutional Court ruled that the amnesty clause was unconstitutional. Since 2014, SADC has been nudging Lesotho to undertake constitutional, security and public service reforms – and facilitator, retired Deputy Chief Justice Dikgang Moseneke has brokered a deal towards dialogue. Metsing is facing allegations of corruption and masterminding the 2014 failed coup in which a policeman was killed. He is also accused of being behind the killing of former army commander Maaparankoe Mahao. Moseneke’s deal has a Clause 10, that provides for a moratorium for amnesty from prosecution during the reforms. However, the Lesotho Constitutional Court has ruled that the clause is unconstitutional – and this could mean Metsing can be arrested upon arrival. Also under fire is Deputy Prime Minister Monyane Moleleki for signing the deal on behalf of the government. The other partners in the four-party coalition have accused Moleleki of being loyal to his former parties, Metsing’s LCD and former Prime Minister Pakalitha Mosisili‘s DC. But his supporters have come to his defence saying he has always preached reconciliation. Long-time SADC facilitator, President Cyril  Ramaphosa, is expected to attend the reforms dialogue on Monday – and Metsing’s LCD says it is continuing with preparations for his welcome party scheduled for Sunday while the government continues to present a united front despite the Clause 10 fallout.
