Limpopo MEC for Co-operative Governance Jerry Ndou and MEC for Community Safety Makoma Makhurupetje will visit the family of a slain African National Congress (ANC) ward councillor at the Greater Fetakgomo-Tubatse Local Municipality on Wednesday afternoon. Forty two-year-old Thabang Maupa was shot dead on Monday night. He had criticised the municipality’s investment of more than R200 million at the now liquidated VBS mutual bank.
