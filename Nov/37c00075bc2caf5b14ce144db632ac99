The African National Congress (ANC) has taken its Thuma Mina election campaign to the Mpumalanga province. Senior ANC members are visiting different parts of the province over the weekend to interact with residents regarding service delivery issues.  Some members of the National Executive Committee are in the Botlabela region in Bushbuckridge area conducting door to door campaigns ahead of the next year’s general elections. Botlabela Region Chairperson Gillion Mashego says: “We are going to talk to the people and do door to door campaigning. Thereafter, we will come to the mass meeting here (Botlabela) then the leadership of the ANC will address the masses here and mobilise them for the ANC votes in 2019.”
