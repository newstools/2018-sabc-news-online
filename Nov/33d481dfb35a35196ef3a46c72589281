An Egyptian security delegation visited protests along the Gaza-Israel border Friday, organisers said, as it sought to broker a long-term truce between the Jewish state and the Palestinian enclave’s Islamist rulers Hamas. In the first such publicly announced visit by Egyptian officials, the delegation briefly attended the Palestinian demonstrations in northern Gaza, a statement from the head of the organising committee said. Eyewitnesses said a car carrying the delegation briefly drove to a protest site a few hundred metres from the border, before departing. Friday’s protests come amid talk of a breakthrough in months of Egyptian-led negotiations. A truce deal would see the often-violent protests end in exchange for an easing of Israel’s crippling blockade of the Gaza Strip. Thousands again gathered at multiple sites near the frontier Friday but largely stayed away from the border fence, AFP correspondents said. Hamas security prevented protesters from approaching the border too closely, the correspondents said. In total seven Palestinians were shot and wounded, the health ministry in the strip said. At least 218 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire since protests began on March 30. One Israeli soldier was killed by a Palestinian sniper.
