The Mayor of the Emfuleni Local Municipality in the Vaal, Jacob Khawe, says an investigation will be conducted into the alleged irregular and unauthorised spending amounting to over R800 million. He says some of the challenges have been identified in the supply chain division, water and electricity units as well as fleet management. Khawe told the media in the Gauteng legislature in Johannesburg that the investigation would be able to determine the individuals involved. “What happened to the money? The investigation will tell us more. This contract expired in April 2017 but November 2017 we were still paying them irregularly without proper authorisation so what happened to the money it means it went to this contract,” states Khawe.
