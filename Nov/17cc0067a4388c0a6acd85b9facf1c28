The Hawks in the Western Cape have started to clamp down on illegal firearms in the security industry and are sending strong messages to transgressors. The owner of a Cape Town security company, Schlomo Schwartz was fined R30 000 following the seizure of firearms and defective permits on Friday. Hawks spokesperson, Philani Nkwalase says the weapons and permits were confiscated from security guards who were escorting gang boss, Ralph Stansfield to the Khayelitsha Court in July last year. In a separate incident, the Hawks seized three illegal firearms from a Johannesburg-based security company as part of ongoing investigations into rogue security enterprises. Nkwalase says no arrests have been made at this stage. “The company owner who is a 53-year-old suspect was then fined R30.000 for the three firearms and the defective licence. In a separate and unrelated matter the two special revolvers and one shotgun were allegedly found at a security company operating in Crosby Johannesburg,” explains Nkwalase.
