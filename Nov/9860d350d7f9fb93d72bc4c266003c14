Three men will on Tuesday appear in the Pretoria Magistrates’ Court in connection with the death of 20-year old Dean Jafta who was reburied at the weekend. He went missing in May last year. Jafta’s family and friends in Eersterust, east of Pretoria held a massive search but couldn’t find him. Earlier this month, the police admitted that Jafta’s body had been found in Midrand shortly after he disappeared and was given a paupers burial without the police trying to identify the body. The three men suspected of murdering him were arrested later. Jafta’s body was exhumed last week and reburied in Eersterust on Sunday. Related Video:
