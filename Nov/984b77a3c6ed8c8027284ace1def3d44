Telkom CEO, Sipho Maseko, says significant investment in infrastructure will have to take place to enable the use of 5G connectivity. Telkom was one of the stakeholders who took part in public hearings on the Electronic Communications Amendment Bill at Parliament. The aim of the amendment is to ensure faster, cheaper and quality connectivity across the country. Maseko says the faster connectivity needs more investment now. “If you believe that almost everything will be connected, it means we have to be able to increase the number of nodes where this data is transmitted from or to. The nodes may be different for 3G as for 5G.”
