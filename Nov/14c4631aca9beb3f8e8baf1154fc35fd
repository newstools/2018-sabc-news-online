The Economic Freedom Fighters says it is considering legal action against the Investigative Journalism Centre – AmaBhungane. This relates to a story that a fleet company that won the city’s one-billion-rand contract allegedly made payments to a company linked to EFF leader Julius Malema. It is also alleged that the contract was originally granted to car rental company Avis but was later awarded to Afrirent, which is allegedly used as a slush fund for the EFF. However, EFF spokesperson Mbuyiseni Ndlozi says this is another attempt to discredit his party. <a href="https://iono.fm/e/631824">Content hosted by iono.fm</a>
