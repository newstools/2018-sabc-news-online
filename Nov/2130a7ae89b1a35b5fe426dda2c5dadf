Most of the people attending the Dros rape case at the Pretoria Magistrate’s Court have accused the defence of using delaying tactics. On Thursday morning the defence lawyer Riaan Du Plessis successfully applied for his client Nicholas Ninow to be referred to Weskoppies Psychiatric Hospital for observation. This is after Du Plessis argued that Ninow has a history of mental disorder and was previously diagnosed with bipolarity. African National Congress (ANC) Women’s League Secretary General Meokgo Matuba says the accused in this case is also trying to play victim by asking to be referred to a psychiatric facility for mental observation. “The strategy here is about the accused playing being a victim. He is the accused and his is not the victim. There is a victim in this instance, the little girl who is seven year old. And what we want to encourage and to show South Africans is that in most instances when there are people who commits crime, there is a tone and trends that are developing of which are saying to us South African if it committed by a particular people it is therefore not going to be regarded as crime and people would begin to raise mental issues,” says Matuba. The Pretoria Magistrate’s Court has postponed the rape case of a 22-year-old Ninow to the 28th of this month.  Watch related videos below
