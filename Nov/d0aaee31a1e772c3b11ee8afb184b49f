Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan says he was not extended the courtesy of being notified he would be fired as Finance Minister in 2017 – along with other ministers. He says he learned of his demotion when then President Jacob Zuma made the announcement on television. Gordhan added, “After consulting with my family, I did take the position and served in that position just past midnight on the 30th of March when watching TV and the intrigue that was unfolding at the time and learned from the TV screen that a number of us were dismissed.” Deputy Chief Justice Zondo then asked, “So you were not informed ahead of the TV announcement that you were no longer going to continue in the position?” Minister Gordhan replied, “No I was not extended that courtesy. I then remained as an MP serving on the Public Enterprises Committee.” Gordhan also said it’s both intriguing and shocking that his statement of evidence for the State Capture Commission was leaked to the media. He says this was after his initial evidence was sent to the Commission’s evidence leader, Advocate Paul Pretorius and his team. However, commission chair, Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo, has assured Gordhan that the investigation into the leaking of his evidence is underway.
