Western Cape tourism body (WESGRO) has embarked on an intensive tourism campaign to entice visitors who’ve been discouraged by the recent drought to visit the province. CEO Tim Harris, says they’re hoping to increase tourism to double digit growth figures. Harris says negative messages went out globally depicting Cape Town as the first major city in the world that could run out of water. “We think the way to do that is to put out a single message between government, City Government, Provincial Government of the Western Cape and National Government via South African Tourism – combine that message with the private sector and putting out a single message about how we’re open for tourism. The way we’ve done that is a very provocative campaign we call “Nowhere does it better” , what that does is take some of the most iconic tourist destinations throughout the world, and actually say we do tourism better than they do.” Watch related video:
