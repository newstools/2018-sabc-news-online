Political parties have stuck to their positions on the issue of whether the constitution should be amended to allow for the expropriation of land without compensation. Parties were giving their positions on the issue during the meeting of the Constitutional Review Committee on the matter. The ANC, the EFF, The UDM and the NFP all spoke in favour of an amendment. EFF leader Julius Malema said it was important to allow for expropriation without compensation if black South Africans are to play a meaningful role in the economy. “In the hearings where I participated, majority of our people agreed that we should amend the constitution because it must give them access to land to resolve inequality, unemployment, landlessness and poverty that is found amongst our people… They want the land to use their land to feed themselves, but also to empower themselves so that they can become active participants in the economy of South Africa.” The Constitutional Review Committee is due to conclude its work this week on the possible amendment of the constitution to allow for the expropriation of land without compensation. However, some opposition parties have raised concerns about the process so far. Top among these is that the committee has not deliberated on the more than half a million written submissions it received. Watch related video below:
