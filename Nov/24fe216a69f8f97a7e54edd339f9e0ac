Water utilities are appealing to consumers to use water sparingly as the heat wave sweeps across the country.  They say the extremely hot weather conditions being experienced in Gauteng, the North West and Mpumalanga have already resulted in high water consumption. This is placing a strain on the bulk water supply networks. Rand Water’s spokesperson, Justice Mohale, says consumers’ failure to conserve water could result in shortages. “There are simple things that people can do.  Refrain from washing your pavement because you drive around, you see people washing their pavement with clean water.  You know the effort and chemicals that are used to purify water are very expensive. People water their gardens during the day we say please refrain from doing that. People washing their cars – sprinkling them with sprinkler guns we say refrain from doing that because you are wasting water,” says Mohale.
