Eskom says there’s a high possibility of stage 2 load shedding on Friday. The power utility says its power generation plant is undergoing maintenance. Eskom says a higher than expected number of its units experienced technical faults and would have unplanned maintenance as well. It also says the Cahora Bassa hydropower plant in Mozambique is supplying more than 700 mega-watts less to the grid as a result of a damaged transmission line. Eskom deputy spokesperson Dikatso Mothae says: “There is a high probability of stage 2 rotational load shedding from 9am until about 10 o’clock in the evening as a result of loss of additional units over night. As you aware we had to implement stage 1 load shedding on Thursday from about 12 noon until about 9pm. Today it looks like we may need to go into stage 2 load shedding.” Related Video
