Political analyst Tinyiko Maluleke says former president Jacob Zuma may have filed an affidavit in the Constitutional Court on Tuesday for the fear of being exposed. In the affidavit, Zuma claims that the Nugent Commission of Inquiry into SARS had no basis to recommend the firing of former revenue services boss Tom Moyane. Zuma says it was he and not his successor Cyril Ramaphosa who called for the establishment of the commission. Zuma says the commission deviated from its originally intended purpose by dealing with the employment contracts of individual employees. Maluleke says, “The stakes must be very, very high. It is possible that former president Zuma feels that he himself might end up being exposed. The President of the country is Cyril Ramaphosa. He has appointed this commission. It is up to him and the commission to work out the modalities of the reporting. I don’t know that a former president can come and continue to dictate the work of a commission, especially if he did not promulgate it.” Tom Moyane Retired Judge Robert Nugent found that Moyane was not fit to lead SARS and he should be removed. Moyane’s lawyer Eric Mabuza says his client will testify before the State Capture Commission to give his side of the story. Watch related video:
