More than 60 small businesses in the eThekwini Municipality have benefited through interventions by the Department of Small Business Development. The Department seeks to equip small businesses with the knowledge and skills required to uplift their standards of production. A lack of skills and equipment are some of the challenges that small businesses in KwaZulu-Natal face, especially those within the eThekwini municipality. The national Department of Small Business Development, together with the Small Enterprise Development Agency (SEDA), have intervened by providing different types of equipment to small traders in Durban. Minister Lindiwe Zulu says they are prepared to change the status of small businesses across the country to participate in the mainstream economy. “We have been going around the entire country and people who are beneficiaries today have to do training and complete the training. They can only be given the implements of trade if they show that there is a potential for their businesses to grow.” SEDA CEO, Mandisa Tshikwantamba, says they have set aside more than R17 million to develop small businesses. “To date, we have reached at least 50% and we are still continuing even in Durban. There are still 34 people that we shall be coming back for as we are just doing the rounds and we are finishing the procurement.” Mantinto Simelane, who is a beneficiary of the programme, says that they are hoping to increase their production. “If we need to produce more, we need more machine and we hope that we will be able to supply our customers.”
