The South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) wants to hold an urgent meeting with President Cyril Ramaphosa, Minister of Communications Nomvula Mokonyane and Minister of Finance Tito Mboweni to discuss the financial constraints of the public broadcaster. The SABC told Parliament on Tuesday that the disclaimer that they received from the Auditor-General is making financial institutions reluctant to assist them. The Board and top executives of the Corporation were briefing Parliament about the looming retrenchments. Deputy Chairperson of the Board Mathatha Tsedu says they have done everything possible to contain costs. “We have gone to the President, to the Minister of Finance, to the Minister of Communications to say let’s have a joint meeting of all those three people and ourselves to discuss this crisis. The deadline we gave them for that meeting is this week. So from where we sit we have done whatever maybe expected of a Board like ours,” states Tsedu. Watch related video below:
