The National Assembly Programme Committee has rescheduled the debate on the Constitutional Review Committee report on amending Section 25 of the Constitution for December 4. The report, which was adopted a week ago, is expected to be debated in the House on Tuesday next week. The National Council of Provinces (NCOP) is also expected to debate the same report in the chamber. The report recommends that Section 25 of the Constitution be amended to make provision for the expropriation of land without compensation. However, lobby group AfriForum has served Parliament with court papers to stop the debate from taking place pending the outcome of a judicial review of the committee process. African National Congress (ANC) Chief Whip, Jackson Mthembu, has told the Programme Committee that they maintain that the process should be transparent. “We will say what we said also in the Chief Whip’s Forum. That matter was before the committee; there were public hearings; there were public submissions; there was a committee deliberations and discussions and the report was adopted and properly ATCed as honourable Mulder has corrected all of us. I still want to know what is this procedural matter he’s speaking about and that Afriforum has taken to court? But it’s a matter that we will speak to. We are convinced that the process followed was transparent, fair and allowed public participation and that’s why this matter is  now before Parliament.” Watch related video below:
