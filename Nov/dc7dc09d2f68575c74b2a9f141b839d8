Over a 100 000 people have assembled at the FNB Stadium in Johannesburg on Sunday for the “2018 National Day of Prayer for all South Africans”. The event is hosted by the Motsepe Foundation. About 33 religious and faith-based organisations as well as traditional leaders are represented. People will pray for unity among all South Africans – as well as an end to poverty – among other things.
