The interview process to select a suitable person to lead the National Prosecuting Authority will resume on Friday morning after it was adjourned last night. Two more candidates, Advocate Shamila Batohi and Advocate Simphiwe Mlotshwa, are expected to be interviewed. Nine candidates have so far been taken through a very public interviewing process at the Union Buildings. The 12th candidate on the shortlist Glynnis Breytenbach pulled out in the 11th hour. The interviewing panel led by Minister Jeff Radebe will submit three names to President Cyril Ramaphosa. A successful candidate is expected to be named by the President before the end of the year. Candidates were quizzed on Thursday about cases they had handled, their plans should they be appointed and their overall fitness to hold such a crucial office. On Thursday, Western Cape Director of Public Prosecutions Rodney de Kock concluded his interview under intense questioning from the panel. “Not ideal to have so many former NPA prosecutors shortlisted for NDPP”
