Eskom CEO Phakamani Hadebe says they will be in court early next month in an effort to recover R650 million from Gupta linked company, Trillian. Hadebe is appearing before Parliament’s Public Enterprises Portfolio Committee, to discuss the power utility’s report for the 2017/18 financial year. The power utility is trying to recover money from Trillian after a dispute over services delivered. Hadebe says this is part of their attempts to clean up and turnaround Eskom’s financial situation. “We’re going to court in December to recover R650 million from Trillian,” he adds.
