A woman has been charged with the death of her husband in Kagiso, west of Johannesburg. Lungile Ntuli’s husband was found unconscious in a bath-tub full of boiling water at their home. She appeared in the Kagiso Magistrate’s Court on Thursday but was released as investigations continued. Ntuli told police that she left her husband in the process of taking a bath while she went out shopping. She returned to find water coming out of the kitchen door and her husband lying in the bath unconscious. The man was rushed to hospital but died of his injuries a few days later. The incident happened in October but police only arrested Ntuli on Wednesday. Kagiso Police’s Solomon Sibiya says: “She was charged with murder and appeared in court on Thursday where she was released by the state prosecutor on the basis that she was cooperative pending further investigations.”
