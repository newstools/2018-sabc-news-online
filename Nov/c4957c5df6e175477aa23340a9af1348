SABC trade Unions have handed over a memorandum in protest of the planned retrenchments during a picket. Trade unions argued that the mismanagement of funds is not due to employees but a result of poor management. Among the demands made in the mandate presented to management, trade unions suggested a strategy to reduce management salaries by 40%. They should cut on wasteful expenditure by cutting down the number of SABC board members. Provincial Secretary of CWU, Aubrey Tshabalala, urged management not to privatise SABC as it is a public entity. “On the 4th to the 7th of October the President of this country signed and committed on a job summit. He said that they are committing to job creation in South Africa. They are also committing to sustain resisting jobs. How is it possible that a state owned entity is the one that is championing the retrenchment of workers?” Tshabalala asked. The Unions have given SABC Management 7 days to respond to their demands. Failure to do so will result in the Unions submitting a 48 hour notice for the shutdown of the SABC. Watch related video below:
