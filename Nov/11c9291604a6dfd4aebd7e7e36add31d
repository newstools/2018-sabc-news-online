The IEC has urged residents of ward 47 in Mangaung, Bloemfontein, to come in their numbers to register to vote in the by-elections. The registrations come after the resignation of Democratic Alliance DA councillor John De Bruin. The by-elections will be held in January 2019. IEC Free State Manager Itumeleng Liba says the registrations will take place on Saturday and Sunday this weekend. “We have 10 voting stations and over 10 000 voters. Voters are urged to come and register, check their particulars and update their addresses on the two days, at 7 until 5 on both days,” says Liba.
