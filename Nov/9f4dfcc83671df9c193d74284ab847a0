Nine suspects arrested in connection with two counts of murder and attempted robbery in Schweizer Reneke in the North West are on Wednesday expected to apply for bail at the local magistrateâ€™s court. The suspects were arrested by the police provincial task team established just four days after the incident. Their arrest follows the killing of two family members of the late struggle icon, Ahmed Kathrada last week Thursday in Schweizer Reneke. The killing of the two Kathrada family members happened on the 1st of this month. One of them, Ahmed, age 28, allegedly came home, opened the gate and was over powered by two suspects. He was then shot in the chest. His mother who was inside the house heard the noise and alerted her husband, Yunus. Yunus opened the the door and was also shot at the back of his head. The suspects fled the scene and were arrested a few days later. Meanwhile, community members are expected to picket outside court in protest against the granting of bail to the suspects.
