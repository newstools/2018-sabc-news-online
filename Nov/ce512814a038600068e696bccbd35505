Former South African Airways  (SAA) Board Chair, Cheryl Carolus, has taken the stand at the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture in Parktown, Johannesburg. Carolus and other board members resigned as board members of  SAA  in 2012. Carolus said at the time that her relationship with the then Public Enterpises Minister, Malusi Gigaba, had broken down irretrievably. In her testimony on Thursday, Carolus details events at the time when she and other African National Congress (ANC) stalwarts expressed concern to the party leader at the time, former president Jacob Zuma. “I am deeply disturbed by the events over the past ten years or so in our country and initially we were quiet. I used an analogy when I wrote an open letter to then president Jacob Zuma and told him the pot syndrome – where there is a candle burning under it, where you just adapt and adapt your levels of tolerance until you finally realise you’ve reached boiling point. But also, I do think there was a very strong view amongst us ANC members of we would harm the organisation and the country if we spoke out,” says Carolus. Click link for more
