Municipalities owe Eskom R18 billion in debt. This is according to Eskom CEO, Phakamani Hadebe who is appearing before Parliament’s Public Enterprises Portfolio Committee. Hadebe is discussing the power utility’s report for the 2017/18 financial year. He says the debt is a worrying factor as it affects sustainability. He also says they will be in court early December in an effort to recover R650 million from Gupta linked company, Trillian. Hadebe says this is part of their attempts to clean up and turnaround Eskom’s financial situation. “We’re going to court in December to recover R650 million from Trillian,” he adds.
