The African National Congress (ANC) in the Western Cape says its concerned by the ongoing attempts to develop part of the Bo-Kaap in Cape Town. This follows widespread protests earlier this week to stop the construction of high rise buildings in the area. The ANC’s Western Cape Secretary, Faiez Jacobs, says they want the Bo-Kaap to be declared a heritage site. “It is clear that the developers remain insensitive to the majority sensitive sentiment in that community. Bo-Kaap is the oldest and only living heritage area in our country it has been home to the Muslim community of Cape Town for over 300 years,” says Jacobs.
