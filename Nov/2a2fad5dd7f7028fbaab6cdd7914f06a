Former Government Communication and Information System (GCIS) Head Mzwanele Manyi says he does not know whether the Gupta family was involved in allegations of State Capture. Manyi was answering questions at the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture currently under way in Parktown, Johannesburg. The Commission’s legal team was seeking clarification on Manyi’s earlier testimony, and the role he played at Government Communications during his tenure from 2011 until 2012. Manyi was responding to evidence leader, Vincent Maleka’s questions. “My answer is that I don’t know… I must take the cup in terms of producing documentary evidence of things that I am talking about. People that have been here have been very poetic without producing evidence. So, I just don’t know. I sit here now – I can’t point to any piece of evidence that anybody here put on this table.” Manyi has also been questioned why more money was spent on advertising in The New Age newspaper during his tenure at Government Communications. This as opposed to The Daily Sun which is the country’s biggest publication. Meanwhile, SABC television equipment was stolen at the Commission of Inquiry. A suspect was caught on camera leaving the venue with the stolen equipment. The Commission, which has since wrapped up proceedings for the day, will resume on Tuesday morning. Author- Mbali Thethani
