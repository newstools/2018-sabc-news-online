Civil society groups and gender activists are expected to protest outside of the Pretoria Magistrate’s Court on Wednesday morning as the accused in the Dros rape case returns to the dock. 22-year-old Nickolas Ninow is accused of raping a 7-year-old girl at a Dros restaurant in Pretoria East, last month. He briefly appeared in court at the beginning of this month and was sent for mental observation at the Weskoppies Psychiatric Hospital in Pretoria West. Activists are calling for a harsh sentence to be imposed.  They say he should not be at large amid the 16 Days of Activism against Violence and Abuse of Women and Children. Ninow has been provisionally charged with rape, possession of drugs, assault with intent to do bodily harm and intimidation.
