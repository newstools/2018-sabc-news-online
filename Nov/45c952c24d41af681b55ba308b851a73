The former guard accused of raping and sexually assaulting learners at the A.B. Xuma primary school in Soweto, has pleaded not guilty to 13 charges against him – two of rape and 11 of sexual assault. Johannes Molefe is appearing in the High Court sitting at Palm Ridge Magistrate’s Court on Gauteng’s East Rand. Initially over 80 learners came forward accusing him of sexually assaulting them, but the NPA only laid 13 charges, as no prima facie evidence could be found for the rest. Because of the case involving children – court proceedings are being held in camera. Only parents of the children have been allowed inside the court. The 58-year-old Molefe was arrested in October last year after several parents came forward about his alleged sexual acts. The court also heard that one of the girls from AB Xuma primary school developed an infection. This after being sexually abused by the guard. One of the girls recounted a cold morning when she and a fellow pupil sat in the security office. When the other pupil left, Molefe pulled up her tunic and underwear before sexually assaulting her. She later developed a bladder infection. The nine-year-old also told the court that a teacher and the principal asked her to keep mum about the attack. The trial continues. Watch related video below:
