Former North West Premier, Supra Mahumapelo, says he does not regret his alleged involvement in the VBS Mutual Bank scandal. Media reports suggest that Mahumapelo ‘vigorously encouraged’ municipalities in the North West to deposit R314 million with VBS Bank. It is alleged that Mahumapelo, who resigned in May following widespread protests against him, invited VBS to make a presentation at his Bokone Bophirima premier’s co-ordinating council in March 2017. He says there was no such, but doesn’t regret utilising a black bank for government transactions. “VBS people are taking this to Nedbank if something goes wrong in future in Nedbank will you say to the current leadership of the government, including President Ramaphosa that you regret that particular decision? There is no regret. You take a decision at that moment as a leader and when those are implement it wrong, the law must take its course. You can’t say you shouldn’t have made that pronouncement. Investments must happen in SA,”says Mahumapelo. Meanwhile, hundreds of African National Congress (ANC) members from the North West are attending the High Court in Johannesburg where Mahumapelo is challenging the National Executive Committee’s (NEC) decision to disband their  Provincial Executive Committee (PEC). The members want the NEC’s decision to be overturned, claiming it was invalid and irrational. Mahumapelo was forced to resign as premier after violent protests erupted to show their dissatisfaction with his leadership. Click links for more
