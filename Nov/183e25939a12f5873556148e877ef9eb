This is contained in a 286-page affidavit Zuma filed in the Pietermaritzburg High Court.

Zuma faces sixteen charges of fraud, corruption, racketeering and money-laundering related to the multi-billion rand arms deal. Thales faces charges of fraud and corruption. Zuma further says there was improper influence in his prosecution and improper conduct by the individual prosecutors. He also says he faced public and media prosecution engineered by the National Prosecuting Authority â€“ to the point that his name became synonymous with corruption. Zuma concludes his affidavit by saying that the delays in his trial have been extremely long, that the pre-trial irregularities were glaring and that the prejudice against him, blatant.
