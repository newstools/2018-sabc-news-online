President Cyril Ramaphosa has warned of the rise of racism around the world during his on-going tour of Europe. The president delivered a speech to the European Parliament in Strasbourg, before heading to Brussels for a summit with European Union (EU) leaders. Welcomed into the chamber of the European Parliament to rapturous applause, President Ramaphosa used his speech to call on Europe to remain open to its friends in the international community like South Africa. “The spectre of the resurgence of racism and xenophobia cloaked into the mantle of nationalism is rising, and is causing a great deal of concern in a number of places. Unilateralism is on the rise and threatens in many ways to underline our collective commitment to democratic values and the respect of human rights.” The President also defended his land reforms, which have gained media attraction in Europe, saying they are in line with South Africa’s constitution. The president was praised by the leaders of the Parliament. “Your reforms are contributing to revitalise South Africa’s economy by attracting foreign investments, enhancing private sector competitiveness, creating jobs especially for the young, fighting corruption and inequality and improving citizens’ rights,” says European Parliament President Antonio Tajani. One of the main goals of this European tour by the president is to boost foreign investment into South Africa. Straight after the speech, President Ramaphosa flew to Brussels and was welcomed at the Royal Palace by the Belgian King. An hour’s meeting with the Belgian King was followed by political meetings with the Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel and then on to the EU South Africa Summit. It is at the summit with European Union leaders where President Ramaphosa will try to secure firm commitments on investment partnerships and will be briefed by the EU on Brexit with a deal on the UK’s exit from the EU now firmly on the table.
