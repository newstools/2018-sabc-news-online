Western Cape Health MEC, Nomafrench Mbombo, has called on child carers and paediatric nurses to be vigilant for incidents of diarrhoea. The summer season is known for children, particularly under the age of five, falling ill with diarrhoea. Mbombo has visited the Nomzamo informal settlement in the Strand outside Cape Town as part of an outreach programme to create awareness and educate communities about the disease. She says it’s important to take note of signs and symptoms. “The issue of the diarrhoea is very common during the summer season, so today we want to create awareness. We visited some of the babies to give information to the parents plus also to launch the new road to health card that provides information for the caregivers of a child to look for the danger sign. So we are warning the caregivers of children under the age of five, when their child has got a lot of diarrhoea and the child has got difficulty in breathing, they must quickly bring the child,” adds Mbombo.
