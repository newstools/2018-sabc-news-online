The African National Congress has confirmed that its national chairperson Gwede Mantashe will appear before the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture on November the 27th. Former Public Enterprises minister Barbara Hogan has implicated Mantashe in the evidence she submitted to the commission earlier this week. South Africa’s four major banks also implicated Mantashe in their testimonies to the commission in September. They testified that Mantashe and the party’s NEC member Enoch Godongwana summoned them to the ANC’s headquarters at Luthuli House to account for why they had closed bank accounts linked to the Gupta family. The commission is set to resume on Monday in Parktown, Johannesburg, with Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan expected to take the witness stand. ANC spokesperson Zizi Kodwa says: “We would like to give our version of both the banks and some of the aspects and some of the issues raised in her submission, her testimony comrade Barbara.” “We have now been given the 27th of November that our delegation led by former secretary general Mantashe will be making a submission on behalf of the African National Congress, on those aspects. it’s important for the ANC to clarify and to give our version.” Related video click below:
