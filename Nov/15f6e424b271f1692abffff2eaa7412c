The stage has been set for another nasty court battle over parliament’s decision to amend the Constitution to expropriate land without compensation. A report that recommends the amendment of Section 25 of the constitution was supported by the African National Congress (ANC) and the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) amid huge outcries from opposition parties, NGO’s and academics. It transpired from the outset, when the EFF and the Democratic Alliance (DA) came up with two different proposals that chances for a compromise were not possible. While the ANC and the EFF agree on the amendment of Section 25, they still differ on its implementation. The ANC wants a mixture of both private and state ownership of land, but the EFF wants none of that. “The EFF’s position is very clear that all land must be owned by the state. We don’t want that thing of a mixed ownership,” says Julius Malema leader of the EFF. After several hours of deliberations, the proposal to amend Section 25 was put on the table. Twelve members of the ANC, EFF and the National Freedom Party (NFP) voted for an amendment, while four members of the DA and other small opposition parties voted against. The report will now be submitted to both houses of parliament for adoption and implementation. But opposition parties and other stakeholders will now challenge this in court. Watch Video Below :
