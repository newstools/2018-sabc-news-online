African National Congress (ANC) Chief Whip Jackson Mthembu says they will intervene to ensure that three villages in the Mogalakwena Municipality in Limpopo, where residents share water with animals, get clean water. Mthembu visited the Taulome, Pudi-ya-Kgopa and Good Hope communities during an ANC Thuma Mina campaign. The municipality says residents are likely to get water in February 2019, from a reservoir which has been built in the area. Mthembu says they will intervene in order for the communities to get water as soon as possible. “We are told that the project is almost done. But it will only pump water around February. We are saying people can’t wait until February to get water. We will then be intervening to do whatever we can with the contractor and with other service providers so that water from this project can start flowing to the three villages.” “We have spoken to the mayor that let’s have more tanks so that people don’t drink water from one area with animals.” Related video click below:
