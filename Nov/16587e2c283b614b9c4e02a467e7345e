Former South African Airways (SAA) Board Chairperson, Cheryl Carolus, has told the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture that the Johannesburg-Mumbai-India route was very important to SAA, as it brought people from the east to west corridor. Carolus is giving her testimony at the commission in Parktown, Johannesburg. She served in the position from 2009 until 2012, but resigned from it in September 2012. Former Minister of Public Enterprises, Barbara Hogan, had told the inquiry earlier that she had come under pressure to terminate the route so that an Indian airline could take it over. Carolus has admitted to the Commission that the Johannesburg-Mumbai route was making losses. “The Mumbai route was quite critical and it is true we were making losses and we were building up that route from Mumbai to Johannesburg. We had four flights. We would have liked to have seven because you make your money out of business people,” states Carolus.
