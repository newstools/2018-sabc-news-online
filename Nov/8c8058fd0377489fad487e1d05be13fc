Residents falling under the Sol Plaatje Municipality in Kimberley will have to brace themselves for continuous night water cuts. The Municipality is adamant that these water cuts are the only way to avoid the lack of water supply in the municipality. Businesses and residents of Kimberley have been for the past few weeks experiencing water cuts at night – leaving most of them frustrated. Sol Plaatje Municipality spokesperson, Sello Matsie, says night water cut are currently unavoidable as it is the Municipality’s way to avoid day zero. “You might now struggle to just be able to provide water into those pressure towers to feed the city. We might now not have water not only at night but also during the day. That is why when our levels become critical, we pull the plug.” Matsie says if the situation does not change, they would have to implement stage one water restrictions. This would bar residents from using more than twenty litres of water daily and watering their gardens with fresh water. These Kimberley residents are not happy with the water cuts. “We are doing washing and we are cooking with this water and we drink it. So they must really do a plan,” says a resident. “When we come back from work, there is nothing to eat because there is no water to cook,” adds another one. WATCH BELOW:
