The Commission of Inquiry into Zimbabwe post-election violence has wrapped up. Led by South Africa’s former President Kgalema Motlanthe, the seven-member team has been investigating whether police used force during violent protests that killed six people and injured dozens more. After gathering oral and written evidence from more than a hundred witnesses, the commission will analyse the information and compile a final report. Zimbabwe’s opposition leader Nelson Chamisa has distanced his MDC party from the violence. He told the commission he did not incite supporters to take to the streets. Soldiers opened fire and killed six people, injuring dozens more, during the protests. The commission, which commenced on the 19th of September, is confident that it will present its report way before its 90 day deadline. Click video below:
