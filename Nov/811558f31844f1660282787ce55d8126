Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan says state capture has increased joblessness, disenfranchised  the youth and advanced the marginalisation of women. He says it also replaced competent and experienced individuals at the country’s key institutions. Gordhan is appearing before the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture, currently underway in Parktown, Johannesburg. Gordhan said earlier it was intriguing and shocking that his statement of evidence for the State Capture Commission was leaked to the media. He says this was after his initial evidence was sent to the commission’s evidence leader, Advocate Paul Pretorius and his team. However, commission chair Justice Raymond Zondo assured Gordhan that investigation into the leaking of his evidence was underway Gordhan also says he was not extended the courtesy of being notified he would be fired as finance minister in 2017 – along with other ministers. He says he learned of his demotion when then President Jacob Zuma made the announcement on television.
