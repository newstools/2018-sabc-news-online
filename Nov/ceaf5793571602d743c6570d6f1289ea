Traffic authorities have warned motorists to steer clear of R27 road at Vredenberg on the Cape West Coast following protest action in the area. Western Cape Traffic Chief Kenny Africa says about 3 000 people are burning tyres on the road making it inaccessible. Africa says the road is currently closed. “There are between 2 000 to 3 000 people on the road busy burning tyres and making it unbearable for road users. People and traffic officials are on the scene and will do everything to re-open the road as soon as possible. But currently it is not safe.”
