The Portfolio Committee on Police will be briefed on the newly established Anti-Gang unit of the South African Police Service (SAPS) in Parliament on Tuesday. The committeeâ€™s chairperson, Francois Beukman, says the committee regards the establishment of the unit as an important step to ensure that there are operational responses to gang related crime in specific police precincts in the country. He says the aim of the briefing is to get an update from the National Commissioner of Police and his management team on the establishment of the unit, its operational capabilities, human resources and recent successes. Beukman says much more effort and focus should be given by the National Police Management to the administrative and structural finalisation of specialised units within SAPS. The South African Policing Union, (SAPU) has applied for an urgent interdict at the Labour Court in Johannesburg, to stop the police service from establishing gang units across the country.
