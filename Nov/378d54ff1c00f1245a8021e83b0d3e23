The National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) and the KwaZulu-Natal Health Department are working with public health officials from the eThekwini municipality, to investigate the source of a salmonella food poisoning outbreak. Over the weekend,Â  media reports suggested that at least 20 people were hospitalised due to salmonella poisoning in Durban, KwaZulu-Natal. Consumer journalist Wendy Knowler says at this point it is still unclear where does salmonella outbreak comes from. Earlier this year, several cold food manufacturers recalled some of their products following the listeriosis outbreak.  Listeriosis outbreak claimed over 200 lives in the country. Knowler adds that according to the Consumer Protection Act (CPA), any consumer who has been affected by the outbreak can seek a recourse. Food that has been affected include orange juice, eggs, fresh vegetables, frozen dinners, dairy products and peanut butter, based on tests by the laboratory. Symptoms usually include vomiting, stomach cramps and diarrhoea. Click below to listen for more: <a href="https://iono.fm/e/624306">Content hosted by iono.fm</a>
